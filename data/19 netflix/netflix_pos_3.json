      "text": "  Some may say finally, and it is true that Netflix has been hesitant to roll out a download function. But here it is. The download function works on Android and Apple iOS devices. Only select content The new feature allows you to watch Netflix anywhere, including on airplanes and places without coverage. Just remember to click the download button before you leave.However, not everything is available for download. Netflix needs the rights and it appears that some outside studios are not playing ball. Netflixs original productions are all there.- Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today, said Eddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation.Besides the one mentioned, you have Breaking Bad, Mad Men, Minions, lots of content for the young ones, and lots of documentaries. Netflix says that it will add more content later. On Android and iOS If you open the app on an iPhone/iPad or Android devices  the only devices to currently support offline viewing  you have a new Available for Download section.To download one hour of HD quality it takes up approximately 400-500 Mb on your device so you need a lot of free space to download an entire season of a TV series. You can also decide to download in lower SD quality.You have limited time to watch the content, typically ranging from 48 hours to one week.To get started you just need to update the Netflix app. The download function is available for all of Netflixs subscription plans.

      "text": "By : Jeff Perez , Editor Whether you like muscle cars or EVs, these seven movies are available for download on Netflix right now. \nYesterday Netflix introduced the ability to download and watch a select number of shows and movies directly on your mobile device without an internet connection. What a time to be alive! In our ongoing pursuit of all things automotive, we scraped through the downloadable content to see what kind of auto-based movies are actually available for download. A Faster Horse \nThough it may share the same name as our alternate reality online series , A Faster Horse tells the story of the iconic Ford Mustang from past to present, 50 years after its initial debut. The full one hour and 30 minute documentary is available to download. Apex: The Story of the Hypercar \nAs far as self-explanatory titles go, this one is pretty straightforward. Dreamed up by the same producers behind the /Drive YouTube series, Apex highlights the brilliant minds behind some of the most extreme hypercars on the planet. From the Pagani Huayra , to the Koenigsegg Agera , and others, it’s pure automotive bliss in your hands. Death Race 2 / 3: Inferno \nDeath Race 2 and Death Race 3: Inferno might not be the most blockbuster-worthy titles on this list, but the cult classic franchise pegs itself as an even more extreme version of the 1975 thriller Death Race 2000 , and features some of the strangest automotive mashups you'll ever see. Both are available for download.",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nThe evolution of Netflix over the last few years has been impressive to say the least, and the streaming service is now taking yet another step to becoming the leading supplier of home entertainment. While thus far an internet connection has been necessary to consume anything on Netflix, the streaming service announced that as of today, they are beginning to offer downloads of select films and TV series. This allows subscribers to view this entertainment offline, which has been one of the (few) major downsides to Netflix as opposed to competitors like Amazon Prime and YouTube Red. \nNetflix’s new download feature works for Android and iOS phones and tablets, but users will need iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later and an update to the Netflix app to start the offline viewing. Image via Netflix \nThe streaming service will be expanding its library of downloadable content in the future, but right now original series Orange Is the New Black , Narcos , House of Cards , Stranger Things , The Crown , Master of None , and Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt are available for download, as are non-original series like The Office , The Flash , and The 100 . On the feature film side, the animated features Home and Minions are available. \nThis is a pretty huge move on Netflix’s part, as it now allows subscribers to download films to watch on airplanes, car rides, or when traveling to areas with iffy wifi. The streaming service has been making massive strides ever since it launched original programming with House of Cards , and this past year as seen the streaming service make a big play for original feature films, scoring folks like Will Smith and Adam Sandler to star in Netflix original movies. \nSo yeah, this is probably just the next step on the road towards Netflix’s global domination. Really the only thing holding them back at the moment is their dwindling library of older films, as Netflix has started dropping some of its more expensive licenses to put that money instead towards original content. Thank the Maker for FilmStruck . Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 Related Content ",

      "text": "Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Video have their place, but the truly savvy streamer knows that Plex has the potential to put them all to shame. Plex is a clean, intuitive, powerful media server app that lets you stream any media you own from your computer to almost any device, almost anywhere in the world. Up until now, the service's versatile media player has always required a premium subscription to get the most of it, but now, the app’s basic features are available to anyone, free of charge.\n\nPlex announced the change in pricing structure on Nov. 30, and outlined the differences between free and paid accounts on its website. While many of the service’s fancier features are still stuck behind a paywall, Plex will now let you use the media player — arguably the bread and butter of the program — without dropping a dime. The perks for free users don't end there, either: they can host any content they want on their computers, then stream it to their Web browsers, media players and game consoles. Plex will automatically organize free users’ media libraries, both video and music.\nMORE: Best Streaming Players: Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV & More \nThere are a few other useful features, like screen mirroring and sharing your library with friends, but the message is clear: Basic functionality with one of the friendliest media server programs on the market won’t cost you any money.\nThat’s not to say that you should run out and cancel your subscription, however. For one thing, streaming your video library to iOS and Android devices will cost non-subscribers $5 for a one-time activation fee. Missing out on some of Plex’s more advanced features is even more of a drawback. \nFree users do not have access to Plex DVR, which allows HD antenna owners to record broadcast shows, or Cloud Sync, which lets users set up cloud-based media servers through Amazon Drive. Subscribers can sync content on their mobile devices for offline viewing, as well as let Plex identify songs and provide lyrics. Those with small children should also take note: Only subscribers can set up parental controls.\nPlex Passes cost $5 per month, $40 per year, or $150 for a lifetime pass. Whether or not it’s worth upgrading from the free version depends on how much you rely on the program. Either way, new users would be wise to give Plex a try, especially at its new price point. If you can bring your own media to the streaming party, it’s easily one of the prettiest and simplest ways to get it on your TV and mobile devices.\nSee Also : Best Gifts for Cordcutters \nBest Streaming Video Services How to Buy a Streaming Media Player What Is Miracast?

      "text": "best netflix instant movies More This list is updated monthly to reflect recent availability and to showcase films currently streaming on Netflix, whether we’re talking classics or modern gems.\nNetflix offers roughly a gazillion different movies available through its streaming platform — well, approximately a gazillion. While the landmark service might become surprisingly accurate with its suggestions once you’ve been using it for a while, it’s still often tough to find something worth watching amid the trove of terrible choices.That being the case, we’ve taken the time to wade through the ridiculous amount of content in order to bring you a list of some of the best films currently available on Netflix. Planning your weekend has never been easier.\nRelated: Here’s what’s new on Netflix in December, and what’s going away\nNew for December Animal House As a wise man once said, “there’s a time and place for everything… it’s called college.” Nothing exemplifies this point more than National Lampoon’s Animal House , a 1978 film that follows the mischievous antics of the scofflaw-riddled Delta Tau Chi fraternity in cartoonish fashion. After a series of events lands the fraternity on “double-secret probation,” the ragtag crew of misfits must get their act together or risk losing their charter. The timeless classic showcases stupendous performances from the likes of John Vernon and John Belushi, along with Donald Sutherland, Tim Matheson, and others. From the derelict toga party to Belushi’s cafeteria antics, the iconic scenes just keep coming. Will Delta house make things right with the Dean, or will it set its sights on its rivals and go out in a flaming ball of glory?\n+ Instant Queue\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coen Brothers’ sepia-toned adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey is a delightful romp through Depression-era Mississippi, one that follows three bumbling convicts — Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O’Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) — who escape their chain gang and set off in search of Everett’s buried treasure. Their journey takes them across a surreal vision of the South, as they encounter several characters and events inspired by episodes in the aforementioned epic. In addition to the dusty color palette, the film makes extensive use of period-appropriate music, including blues, gospel, and bluegrass tunes. It’s safe to say that T Bone Burnett’s production has never been so on point.\n+ Instant Queue\nBarry Told through a series of anecdotal moments dotting the college days of the 44th President of the United States, Barry is more of a coming-of-age story than Southside With You , writer-director Richard Tanne’s nostalgic journey through a day in the life of young Barack and Michelle Obama. Australian actor Devon Terrell plays the titular Barry with a surprising amount of depth and persuasion, rolling with the punches as he searches for an identity between the Columbia classroom and the Harlem projects. As he does, he juggles the privileges and the responsibilities that come with dating a white woman. Because of this, the film makes for a skillful examination of bi-racial America and cultural identity as a whole — the fact that the film is a nonfiction piece about a future president just makes it even more striking and relatable.\nRead More Coming December 16\nCaptain America: Civil War The opening salvo of the third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, predictably, spectacular. The titular “civil war” occurs when the opinions of Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) differ regarding control of the Avengers. The two leaders recruit teams for the ensuing clash, with characters such as Spiderman and the Black Panther making their first appearances in the MCU. However, despite the film’s cacophony of special effects and adrenaline-touched sequences, it somehow manages to balance an upwards of 10 comic book characters with plenty of gusto, while presenting a throng of thought-provoking ideas in its wake. Civil War represents Marvel at it’s most entertaining, and, dare we say, mature. Too bad we can’t say the same thing for D.C.’s Batman vs. Superman.. .\nComing December 25\nThe Rock While Michael Bay has never been known as a great director, his first feature film is a fun, restrained action flick. The Rock opens with a disgruntled general (Ed Harris) and a group of his most loyal men stealing chemical weapons and setting up a base on Alcatraz. When they demand a hefty ransom, the FBI plans a covert operation, sending chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage) to infiltrate the prison and disarm the weapons. In order to break into Alcatraz, however, he will need the help of the only man to have ever escaped the facility: John Mason (Sean Connery), a retired SAS captain. The remained of the film plays out like a buddy film, with Goodspeed and Mason getting on each other’s nerves as they try to thwart their enemies. Watching a manic Cage play off of the suave, no-nonsense Connery is just one of the film’s many delights .\n+ Instant Queue\nPirate’s Passage Made-for-TV movies are hit or miss. Pirate’s Passage falls in the former category, however, taking William Gilkerson’s novel of the same name and infusing it with colorful visuals, tremendous voice talent, and a fair share of adventure. The coming-of-age tale involves a 12-year-old boy from Novia Scotia and his mother, both of whom have fallen on hard times as a result of bullying and are struggling to hold on to the family inn. Things quickly change when an enigmatic sea captain (Donald Sutherland), who may or might not be a pirate who supposedly died more than 200 years ago, arrives on the scene to help out. The ensuing journey is exciting, creative, and — best of all — even somewhat enjoyable to adults.\n+ Instant Queue\nDocumentaries Amanda Knox Amanda Knox is a controversial figure — and a well-known one at that. In 2007, the foreign-language student and her boyfriend were wrongly convicted of murdering her fellow flatmate while in Italy, resulting in an eight-year legal battle that saw rampant misogyny, shaky forensic evidence, and shoddy journalism placed at the forefront. In the aptly titled Amanda Knox , directors Brian McGinn and Rod Blackhurst don’t so much recount the events as much as they examine the web of incompetence pervading the sexualized tabloid narrative, thus creating a riveting procedural that’s chock-full of enlightening interviews with Knox and those closest to her.\n+ Instant Queue\nBatkid Begins: The Wish Heard Around the World When Miles Scott was diagnosed with leukemia at just 18 months old, the youngster and his family became embroiled in a battle for survival. As he grew up living with the disease, Scott became fascinated by Batman, who was a symbol of hope while he was undergoing his difficult treatment. After years battling the disease, his parents teamed up with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in order to give their son a chance to be Batman for a day. What began as a simple event quickly blossomed into a massive campaign that brought together people from all over the globe — including iconic Batman actor Adam West and President Barack Obama — and turned San Francisco into Gotham City. Batkid Begins tells the story of how this now-viral story came to be, and moreover, does so beautifully.\n+ Instant Queue\nFinding Vivian Maier Sometimes the most fascinating mysteries stem from the unlikeliest of places. Historian John Maloof, for instance, purchased a box of negatives at a Chicago auction for a mere $400. The work turned out to be that of a Vivian Maier, a former nanny who spent her much of her time capturing exquisite photos in the bustling streets of Chicago in the late- 950s and ’60s. The discovery of Maier’s work upon her death eventually paved the way for a Kickstarter-backed film, Finding Vivian Maier , which centers on Maloof’s search for the unknown talent. The breezy narrative introduces Maier and her candid photography through an assortment of intriguing interviews with those who remember her, many of which shed light on a recluse who, for one reason or another, decided to stow away more than 150,000 photos before her death.\n+ Instant Queue\nJiro Dreams of Sushi You’ll never look at a California roll the same way again after watching this fascinating documentary about one of the best sushi chefs in the world. Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old legend in Tokyo, charges $300 a plate at his small restaurant. The film follows his never-ending quest to perfect the art of sushi, while also profiling his two sons, one of whom is poised to succeed Jiro and carry on the family tradition at the renowned restaurant (Sukiyabashi Jiro).\n+ Instant Queue\nIris\nAlbert Maysles’ penultimate film is a fitting portrait of a fashion icon who, surprisingly, still remains at the top of her game despite her advanced age. The 93-year-old subject is Iris Apfel, one of the most renowned fashionistas and interior designers to have ever trotted the globe. Maysles’ film depicts the stages of her life through a series of interviews, many of which contribute to a film that functions as both an ode to individual uniqueness and an intimate look into a marriage more than 65 years in the making. Apfel’s life (and home) might be cluttered, but it’s chock-full of charming insight more than anything else.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Wrecking Crew You’ve likely heard the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” and the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby,” but you probably never knew that neither band played the instruments on either track. The Wrecking Crew chronicles the collective of L.A.-based studios musicians that did, while emphasizing just how integral the rotating cast of players were to some of the most iconic sounds of the ’60s. The nostalgia-steeped documentary is essentially an ode to these lauded, underappreciated musicians that lacks conflict but shines thanks to candid interviews.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Resurrection of Jake the Snake Aurelian Smith Jr. — better known by his ring persona, Jake “the Snake” Roberts — is a former professional wrestler who dominated the WWF in the late-’80s and ‘90s. As “The Snake,” Smith was notorious for conquering his opponents, taunting them, and even torturing them with his live snake, Damien the Python. Sadly, however, the former wrestler spent the better part of the following decades battling addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine, both of which took a heavy toll on his physical health, family, finances, and even Damien.\nThe Resurrection of Jake the Snake also follows fellow wrestler “Diamond” Dallas Page — who found post-wrestling success as a yoga teacher — and his efforts to rehabilitate Smith and Scott Hall, another friend and former WWE superstar. The candid doc sometimes feels like a reality show and an infomercial for Page’s enterprise, sure, but the interviews with wrestling greats such as Steve Austin, Chris Jericho, and Adam Copeland render it a comeback story with plenty to offer. Apparently, the only place to go from rock bottom is up .\n+ Instant Queue\nValley Uprising Right in the middle of the counterculture era, a group of brave, young individuals dedicated their lives to rock climbing. Set in Yosemite National Park, Valley Uprising tells the story of these young pioneers, who paved the way for the next generation of climbers. But don’t think you need to be a climbing enthusiast to enjoy this unique historical account. The directors masterfully utilize both vintage footage and digitally-animated archival photography to keep you on the edge of your seat, while incorporating a host of enlightening interviews with climbing legends such as Yvon Chouinard, Royal Robbins, Lynn Hill, and John Long. Many contemporary climbers, such as Dean Potter and Alex Honnold, also make an appearance. With fingers of steel, these scofflaws transformed climbing from a “fringe activity” to the respected sport it is today.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Ivory Game In this Netflix Original, filmmakers Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani tell the story of the elephant poaching and the inner workings of the ongoing ivory trade — from the inside out. The film paints a dire picture of the economies, both political and financial, that have emerged as a result of ivory’s value in regions where legal loopholes allow the black-market commodity to move unfettered. From Africa to China to Italy, the film looks to expose the brutality of the ivory trade and help support those looking to make it extinct. It exists in the same vain as heartbreaking documentaries such as Blackfish and The Cove , and as such, it often feels more like a loudspeaker for animal-rights activists than a work of pure journalism. Thankfully, it’s a commanding watch either way .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Short Game Ever seen the excellent, 2002 documentary Spellbound ? Well, The Short Game is kind of like that, though it focuses on eight entrants in the 2012 U.S. Kids Golf World Championship and their overzealous parents instead of a national spelling bee in Washington D.C. Director Josh Greenbaum’s inspiring film follows the young athletes — five of whom are boys and three of whom are girls — beginning six months prior to the competition, profiling their athletic drive and personal interests in equal measure. Some of the athletes hog more of the spotlight than others, such as tennis superstar Anna Kournikova’s younger brother, but they all wind up participating in a competition that spurs both laughter and tears for the children and their parents.\n+ Instant Queue\nComedies Animal House As a wise man once said, “there’s a time and place for everything… it’s called college.” Nothing exemplifies this point more than National Lampoon’s Animal House , a 1978 film that follows the mischievous antics of the scofflaw-riddled Delta Tau Chi fraternity in cartoonish fashion. After a series of events lands the fraternity on “double-secret probation,” the ragtag crew of misfits must get their act together or risk losing their charter. The timeless classic showcases stupendous performances from the likes of John Vernon and John Belushi, along with Donald Sutherland, Tim Matheson, and others. From the derelict toga party to Belushi’s cafeteria antics, the iconic scenes just keep coming. Will Delta house make things right with the Dean, or will it set its sights on its rivals and go out in a flaming ball of glory?\n+ Instant Queue\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coen Brothers’ sepia-toned adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey is a delightful romp through Depression-era Mississippi, one that follows three bumbling convicts — Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O’Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) — who escape their chain gang and set off in search of Everett’s buried treasure. Their journey takes them across a surreal vision of the South, as they encounter several characters and events inspired by episodes in the aforementioned epic. In addition to the dusty color palette, the film makes extensive use of period-appropriate music, including blues, gospel, and bluegrass tunes. It’s safe to say that T Bone Burnett’s production has never been so on point.\n+ Instant Queue\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off Any self-respecting movie buff has seen this movie more times than they can count, but we just couldn’t leave it off the list. The plot follows protagonist Ferris Bueller, who convinces his entire school that death is knocking at his door so he can skip school, then hits the streets of Chicago with his girlfriend and best friend for a day of complete and utter debauchery. It’s a warmhearted comedy about innocence and growing up, chock-full of Chicago landmarks and unforgettable scenes. Oh, ye h.\n+ Instant Queue\nMean Girls There’s no finer take on high school cliques than Tina Fey’s Mean Girls . The cult classic stars Lindsey Lohan as Cady Heron, a 16-year-old girl who is forced to attend public school once her family returns from a decade-long research trip in Africa. Lohan joins the school’s most exclusive outfit, but soon finds herself grappling with psychological status warfare when she falls in love with Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). It showcase girl-on-girl cattiness at its best (and funniest) .\n+ Instant Queue\nBurn After Reading Another day, another wacky comedy from the Coen brothers that quickly spirals way out of control. In this black comedy, a former CIA analyst (John Malkovich) loses a CD-ROM that contains meaningless ramblings on various government activities, many of which are intended for his soon-to-be memoir. When two certifiable dimwits (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) find the disc and think they’ve stumbled upon a treasure trove of valuable secrets, hilarity ensues. George Clooney and Tilda Swinton provide excellent supporting performances as well, but it’s the film’s neurotic score and the tight scripting that truly makes it an anti-spy thriller worthy of the Coen name.\n+ Instant Queue\nIn Bruges Ripe with dark humor, In Bruges showcases what might be Colin Farrell’s best performance . Though the oddball film features a gloomy premise that revolves around two hit men who must lay low at a bed-and-breakfast in Belgium until their boss contacts them, it finds an incredible amount of humor in its witty and sharply written script. Farrell is stupendous, whether portraying an offhanded killer or a fumbling lover.\n+ Instant Queue\nDazed and Confused Richard Linklater’s first coming-of-age comedy got its name from a Led Zeppelin song, which is fairly representative of the movie as a whole. Several of today’s Hollywood heavies, including Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, appear in the film, which follows a group of high-school students as they prepare to finish the school year. Full of drugs, booze, and plenty of ‘70s-inspired hijinks, Dazed and Confused became a cultural touchstone to an entire generation of teenagers, one with an ensemble cast that’s nearly as good as its killer soundtrack.\n+ Instant Queue\nMoonrise Kingdom\nFew directors, writers, or producers showcase a visual or narrative style as distinct as Wes Anderson’s. The whimsical Moonrise Kingdom is one of his best to date. It tells the story of a young scout (Jared Gilman) and a bookish girl (Kara Hayward) who decide to run away together in an effort to temporarily escape their lives — and more so, the parental figures surrounding them. A beautiful, subdued palette makes this oddity of a film a joy to watch, while a tremendous supporting cast — which includes Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, and others — helps capture an eccentric summer filled with affairs and beachside portraits.\n+ Instant Queue\nClueless Another cult classic in the Mean Girls vein, Clueless adapts Jane Austin’s 1815 novel, Emma , and turns it on its head with a modern twist. It follows the wealthy and winsome Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a high-school student in Beverley Hills who sets out to unite two teachers and then popularize new student, Tai Frasier (Brittany Murphy). The lighthearted film spurred a book series, but much like the TV series of the same name, it wasn’t quite the sleeper hit the original film was.\n+ Instant Queue\nDramas Barry Told through a series of anecdotal moments dotting the college days of the 44th President of the United States, Barry is more of a coming-of-age story than Southside With You , writer-director Richard Tanne’s nostalgic journey through a day in the life of young Barack and Michelle Obama. Australian actor Devon Terrell plays the titular Barry with a surprising amount of depth and persuasion, rolling with the punches as he searches for an identity between the Columbia classroom and the Harlem projects. As he does, he juggles the privileges and the responsibilities that come with dating a white woman. Because of this, the film makes for a skillful examination of bi-racial America and cultural identity as a whole — the fact that the film is a nonfiction piece about a future president just makes it even more striking and relatable.\nComing December 16\nThe Big Short Based on a nonfiction book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short explores the systemic failures that led to the 2008 financial crisis through the lens of several men who saw the crisis coming and made millions by betting that the housing bubble would burst. The film is broken into several stories, all tied together by narrator Jared Vennet (Ryan Gosling), a trader whose path intersects with several of the characters. Director Adam McKay (of Anchorman fame) brings his usual flair for the kinetic and comedic, but here the satire is vicious rather than pleasant.\nBetween the meticulous planning of the protagonists and the frantic direction, The Big Short resembles a heist film, though the score is not a bank vault or rare painting, but the economy itself. The film is also educational, interspersed with strange, humorous segments meant to explain aspects of the housing market, such as Selena Gomez and economist Richard Thaler using a blackjack game to explain synthetic CDOs .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Imitation Game Benedict Cumberbatch gives a masterful performance as British codebreaker Alan Turing, whose ability to decipher the German Enigma machine proved vital to the Allied victory in World War II. Nominated for eight Academy Awards and a winner for Best Adapted Screenplay, director Morten Tyldum’s stirring film was lauded by the Human Rights Campaign for its portrayal of Turing’s legacy as a gay man. Keira Knightley and Charles Dance also shine in supporting roles.\n+ Instant Queue\nTitanic James Cameron’s take on the 1912 disaster has it all. The iconic film won Academy Awards for both Best Picture and Best Director, and subsequently spent 12 years at the top of the list of highest-grossing films of all time. It tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet), now nearly 100 years old, who recalls her experience as a 17-year-old passenger aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which hit an iceberg in the north Atlantic and sunk, killing more than 1,500 passengers. A strapping Leonardo DiCaprio plays Winslet’s beloved counterpart, who saves her from jumping overboard before the two helplessly — albeit, briefly — fall in love.\n+ Instant Queue\nBig Eyes A surprisingly tame film from nightmare sculptor Tim Burton, Big Eyes is based on the true story of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), a painter whose husband, Walter (Christoph Waltz), took credit for her works, hoarding the fame and profits for himself. The movie largely traces the course of their relationship, from a meet-cute at an art show, to their divorce and subsequent court battle, while examining how their relationship grows strained and abusive along the way. Although it plays out like a traditional small-scale drama, Big Eyes has enough of Burton’s signature weirdness to keep the audience off-kilter.\n+ Instant Queue\nNo Country for Old Men The Coen Brothers are known for sprinkling even their bleakest films with moments of levity. Such isn’t the case with No Country for Old Men , however, a Western that stays true to the grim, fatalistic source material. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in Texas in the 1980s, the plot centers on Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the remains of a drug deal gone wrong and a bag of money. Moss takes the money, not realizing that the bag contains a tracking device, and is quickly pursued by a Mexican cartel and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an unstoppable hit man less concerned with the money than with teaching everyone he comes across a lesson.\nThe Coens are at the top of their game here; despite the savagery of its subject matter, this is one of the best-looking Westerns of all time. The Coens wisely leave much to the writing to McCarthy, only changing elements here and there, and actors like Bardem wring a great deal out of the sparse but heavy dialogue .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Sting Playing the “long con” has never been so profitable. In this critically acclaimed 1973 crime drama, Robert Redford and Paul Newman join forces to pull off one of the greatest cinematic capers of all time. Redford plays grifter Johnny Hooker, whose thieving ways land him in hot water with crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hooker flees to Chicago to find ex-con Henry Gondorff (Newman), and the two pair up to out-con Lonnegan in a film that won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n+ Instant Queue\nBoyhood So much has been said about the lengthy process behind Richard Linklater’s Boyhood — the film’s 12-year production cycle has been praised both as an undertaking and mocked as a gimmick — that the results are often overlooked. The film, which follows a boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from childhood to his first day of college, is staggering in its portrayal of time. The film is made up of various vignettes from Mason’s life: a baseball game he attends with his father (Ethan Hawke), a high-school party, the small events that comprise a life even though they may not stand out.\nBy the time a teenage Mason creeps through the front door after a “little bit” of drinking and smoking, the weight of the years really hits. Like Mason’s mother (Patricia Arquette), whose attempts to balance work and motherhood form their own narrative, the viewer may be shocked how quickly everything went by.\n+ Instant Queue\nMystic River Mystic River is proof that Clint Eastwood is as masterful a director and composer as he is an actor. It’s a haunting and beautiful story, centered on three childhood friends who reunite later in life as the result of an investigation into the murder of one of their teenage daughters. It’s based on Dennis Lehane’s novel of the same name, and though the rampant profanity and unsettling outcome will likely upset you, the resounding performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are enough to leave you floored when the last scenes of Boston fade out.\n+ Instant Queue\nSaving Private Ryan Director Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan defined the look and tone of almost all World War II-related media for decades to come. During the carnage of D-Day, three of four brothers enlisted in the U.S. military are killed in action. In order to keep the sole remaining brother alive, Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Ranger Battalion gathers a squad of Army Rangers and embarks on a mission to save Pfc. James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper from the 101st Airborne division who has gone MIA in Normandy.\nMiller’s squad treks deep into war-torn France to search for the displaced soldier. From the opening moments at Omaha Beach to the final moments of the film, Captain Miller and his squad face the harrowing reality of combat in World War II, and build unshakable bonds that are formed between soldier during wartime. The all-star cast also includes Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Deisel, Giovanni Ribisi, Ted Danson, Jeremy Davies, Paul Giamatti, and Dennis Farina. Saving Private Ryan won five Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Director, and was nominated for six others, including Best Picture.\n+ Instant Queue\nBeasts of No Nation The Netflix-distributed film from director Cary Joji Fukunaga, the streaming service’s first original feature offering, traces the harrowing life of a child soldier (Abraham Attah) in a West African country who falls in line with a group of mercenaries and their larger-than-life commandant (Idris Elba). Elba is a powerhouse, both terrifying and charismatic. The film tackles the brutal atrocities of war with just the right amount of impact and implication. It’s certainly not an easy watch given the film’s more bold and bloody moments, yet is well worth watching.\n+ Instant Queue\nTo Kill a Mockingbird Robert Mulligan’s To Kill a Mockingbird has been heralded as a masterpiece ever since it first graced the silver screen in 1962. The heartfelt film is based upon Harper Lee’s Pulitzer-winning novel of the same name, which follows lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and the maelstrom of hate and prejudice that swirls around him as he works to defend an innocent black man (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman. In many ways, the film is a strong portrayal of how justice functioned in small-town Alabama, one that also examines the innocence of the Finch children and the special bond between a father and child. Peck’s incredible performance is also one for the books, so much so that his role has essentially become synonymous with the book character.\n+ Instant Queue\nSpotlight There are plenty of films about journalism, most of which are highly romanticized, but Spotlight is one of the few that gets it right. Based on the Boston Globe’s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, the film follows the principle members of the Globe’s Spotlight team as they delve into allegations against various priests in Boston. The team in question is a group of distinct personalities played by an all-star cast, including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams. There is no flashy direction nor pyrotechnics here; director Tom McCarthy keeps things simple, focusing on the grim work of the investigators as they move forward inch by inch, connecting the various tiny pieces they need to craft their story.\n+ Instant Queue\nThrillers and Action Adventure Captain America: Civil War The opening salvo of the third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, predictably, spectacular. The titular “civil war” occurs when the opinions of Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) differ regarding control of the Avengers. The two leaders recruit teams for the ensuing clash, with characters such as Spiderman and the Black Panther making their first appearances in the MCU. However, despite the film’s cacophony of special effects and adrenaline-touched sequences, it somehow manages to balance an upwards of 10 comic book characters with plenty of gusto, while presenting a throng of thought-provoking ideas in its wake. Civil War represents Marvel at it’s most entertaining, and, dare we say, mature. Too bad we can’t say the same thing for D.C.’s Batman vs. Superman.. .\nComing December 25\nThe Rock While Michael Bay has never been known as a great director, his first feature film is a fun, restrained action flick. The Rock opens with a disgruntled general (Ed Harris) and a group of his most loyal men stealing chemical weapons and setting up a base on Alcatraz. When they demand a hefty ransom, the FBI plans a covert operation, sending chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage) to infiltrate the prison and disarm the weapons. In order to break into Alcatraz, however, he will need the help of the only man to have ever escaped the facility: John Mason (Sean Connery), a retired SAS captain. The remained of the film plays out like a buddy film, with Goodspeed and Mason getting on each other’s nerves as they try to thwart their enemies. Watching a manic Cage play off of the suave, no-nonsense Connery is just one of the film’s many delights .\n+ Instant Queue\nPirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl Honestly, who thought a film based on a popular Disney attraction was going to be any good? That said, it surprised moviegoers and the populace as a whole with a score of iconic swashbuckling and classic pirate clichés that ultimately paved the way for far too many sequels. The premise for the original blockbuster centers on one Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who sets out alongside pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue Keira Knightley from the crew of undead pirates that call the Black Pearl home. Most of the performances are so-so, yet Depp’s is so original and iconic that he makes Geoffrey Rush’s nutty portrayal as Captain Barbarossa seem tame. The constant slurring and borderline drunken behavior certainly add to the effect.\n+ Instant Queue\nNightcrawler Jake Gyllenhaal has done exemplary work in the past — take Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain , for instance– but nothing quite compares to his eerie performance as TV stringer Louis “Lou” Bloom in Nightcrawler . The modern thriller, a resounding success for first-time director Dan Gilroy, follows an amateur journalist and former thief as he trolls the mean streets of Los Angeles looking for heinous accidents and crimes to capture on film. Gilroy’s script and vision is both dark and thought-provoking, however, it’s Gyllenhaal’s twisted charisma and his sordid actions as he navigates the unseemly business that truly bring the film to the forefront of recent neo-noir films.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Usual Suspects Noir films often play with perceptions, both the characters’ and the audience’s. This technique is taken to extremes in The Usual Suspects , a 1995 noir that opens with a massacre on a ship. Eager to find out what happened, customs agent Dave Kujan interrogates one of the two survivors, a frail con man named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), who narrates the whole ordeal in a series of extended flashbacks. Kint and four other criminals, after meeting in a police lineup, decide to team up for a for a heist. When they inadvertently steal from an enigmatic crime boss named Keyser Söze, they are forced into taking on a job for him. Naturally, it’s all downhill from there. Christopher McQuarrie’s screenplay is one of the most acclaimed of all time, both for the sharp dialogue and the film’s brilliant structure. An outstanding cast, including Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Spacey, brings the dialogue to life, and their crackling rapport is a treat .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe African Queen The African Queen , first released in 1951, is a star-studded Hollywood classic. Directed by John Huston and co-starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn — two silver-screen legends — the film still holds up more than 60 years later. It was adapted from the C.S. Forester novel of the same name, and takes place East Africa in 1914. In the film, Bogart plays the surly captain of The African Queen , a steamboat that routinely delivers provisions and mail to a British missionary (Hepburn) in the remote village of Kungdu.\nOnce World War I ensues, however, Hepburn is stuck in enemy territory with nowhere to hide. Bogart agrees to help her escape on board his ship, and the former eventually convinces Bogart that the two must do their part to support the British war effort by sinking a nearby German warship. Disheveled and stuck within the limited confines of The African Queen , Bogart and Hepburn deliver one of the best dialogue-driven performances of the era — one that garnered Bogart his only Oscar. Needless to say, watching two masters of the craft share a stage isn’t something you see everyday.\n+ Instant Queue\nOnce Upon a Time in the West null",

      "text": "Just in time for the holiday season, we’re delighted to report that Netflix has put anthology film A Christmas Horror Story up for instant streaming. The fun flick, released last year, made the cut on both Mr. Disgusting’s Top 10 of 2015 list and Trace Thurman’s Top 10 Biggest Surprises of 2015 list ; personally speaking, it was also one of my faves of the year.\nAnd we’re certainly not alone in loving the holiday horror anthology. Earlier this week we launched a poll designed to let you guys pick the best Christmas horror movie of all time , and now a few days into the poll, A Christmas Horror Story is ranking in an impressive sixth place with 147 votes. It’s neck and neck with the 2006 remake of Black Christmas , in fact.\n“ There’s all sorts of craziness in this anthology that delivers on so many different levels; it’s gory, but it’s also goofy, then all of a sudden it’s insanely scary ,” Mr. Disgusting wrote last year. As for Trace Thurman, he called it “ a very fun movie that knows how ridiculous it is .”\nPour yourself a glass of egg nog, spike it with some rum, and enjoy!\nIn A Christmas Horror Story :\nIt’s the season of joy, peace, and goodwill… unless you live in Bailey Downs. Last Christmas Eve, two teens came to a grisly end in a school basement. Now, one year later, a new set of horrors has come to town. As three friends explore the site of the massacre, a malevolent spirit is determined to keep them there forever. One of the first cops to the scene of the bloody murders has new complications as his seven-year-old son exhibits terrifying and violent behavior. And when a local family seeks reconciliation with an estranged aunt for the wrong reasons, they suddenly find themselves running in terror from Krampus, the demonic anti-Santa Claus. Not even St. Nick is immune to the terror as he fights back against a horde of zombie elves. This is destined to be a holiday no one will ever forget. \nDirected by Steven Hoban ( Darknet ), Grant Harvey ( She Made Me Do It ) and Brett Sullivan ( Ginger Snaps 2: Unleashed ), the film stars William Shatner and George Buza.\n\n",

      "text": "\nThe first installment of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls Revival “A Year In the Life” flashes back to the funeral of family patriarch Richard Gilmore (played by the late Edward Herrmann). In this scene, Lorelai Gilmore (Lauren Graham) is standing at the bar when she is approached by her old flame, Jason (Chris Eigeman), who, after offering a perfunctory apology for her loss, stares at her with intent and asks, “Are you happy?”\nIt is difficult to tell whether it is Lorelai or Graham who answers. “Uh, right now?” she inquires archly, looking pointedly around a room filled with mourners. Though this could be a nod to Lorelai’s characteristic wit, it felt more like it was Graham, chastising the writers for thrusting her character into such a contrived conversation.\nI was one of the viewers who tuned in to the series premiere in 2000; I was 11-years-old and watched it with my mother, who squealed in delight, “That sounds like you and me!” at the end of the episode as Lorelai teasingly asks Rory if she is embarrassing her. That, in essence, was the heart of the show: the manner in which we saw ourselves in Lorelai and Rory, and wished our lives played out in Stars Hollow. Therein was the expected poignancy of the revival’s concept: those of us who were Rory’s contemporaries are now the age that Lorelai was when the series began. There existed a sense of having come full circle.\nThat sense quickly evaporated the further I delved into “A Year In the Life.” I expected it to err on the schmaltzy side, to be heavy-handed in a manner that the original series managed to transcend. I did not expect to have such a visceral reaction to the progression of the characters of both Lorelai and Rory.\n[Image by Eric Charbonneau/AP Images] Though I was amused by the concept of the “30-something club,” my first reaction was that Rory would not be at such loose ends if she had, say, student loans, rent, and car insurance to which to tend. In the scene where Luke tells Lorelai he intends to finance his (irritating) daughter April’s postgraduate trip to Europe and Lorelai suggests that April land a job and pay her own way, I caught a glimpse of the everyday struggle that originally rendered the show so relatable. It was quickly overshadowed by Lorelai’s own daughter, who was staggering through the streets demanding that various townspeople locate the boxes of belongings she had stored with them in order to maintain an existence in which she could fly to Europe on a whim and a one-off freelance journalist’s stipend.\nI had never expected Rory to remain above reproach, and in earlier seasons, the fact that she floundered for a time during college resonated. An early-twenties rut, however, bears no resemblance to Rory’s character in the revival, who cheats on a longtime boyfriend with college flame Logan, who is engaged to another woman, and at no point exhibits remorse for any of it. In fact, she often appears put out when Logan’s relationship detracts from his availability to field her rambling, one-sided phone calls about her nonexistent career. I could at times identify with neurotic, terrified-to-screw-up teenage Rory and at-loose-ends early-twenties Rory, but the 32-year-old Rory in this revival is a sociopath who bears no resemblance to anyone I know.\n[Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images] The strengths of Lorelai’s character are also diluted in this revival. In the early seasons, Lorelai was a good and reliable friend, helping Luke paint his diner, lending a hand to Sookie during a time of postpartum stress, minding Babette’s cat. She was a well-intentioned daughter, as evidenced in the episode where she moonlights as her father’s secretary when he starts his own business. I understood why people liked Lorelai and wanted to help her, because she reciprocated; the revival reflects none of this. Lorelai is monstrously self-centered, her demands on friends and loved ones are ridiculous, and it begs the question of who in their right minds would want anything to do with either of these Gilmore Girls.\nAs for the ending, spoiler alert: the 2000 me who began watching the series would not trust the 2016 Rory with my Nano pet, let alone a human baby.\n[Featured Image by Eric Charbonneau/AP Images]\nGilmore Girls: A Year In the Life, And the Ways It Failed Us is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Netflix has created the *perfect* holiday calendar to plan out our binge watching this season Rebecca Vineyard More The days are getting colder, and for many, big holidays are just around the corner. Netflix is always great to pair with a cozy night in. Now, they’ve upped the ante on festive cheer. It’s easy to find great Christmas movies to stream on Netflix – there are roundups of those aplenty. But it’s a bit more rare to get viewing suggestions from Netflix itself . And, tbh, some of them are a bit weird. Now, Netflix isn’t the only one streaming festive cheer – you can find holiday movies online with several services . But, like the updated version of Baby It’s Cold Outside , this Netflix calendar definitely subverts tradition – in a good way. Netflix’s guide to “can’t miss” seasonal offerings started on December 1 st (aka, yesterday!) with A Very Murray Christmas . That means you might already be behind if you plan to strictly follow the calendar. However, you can always catch up over the weekend. After all, Sunday’s selection is a crackling fireplace, so it’s not like you’ll be missing much if you shift away from that. (Though the crackling fireplace is pretty great for background if you’re tree trimming or baking cookies.) Here’s the Netflix calendar of holiday content. Behold it in all its glory. More Also, though, consider the fun/ weird/ eclectic suggestions. Classics like White Christmas and Miracle on 34 th Street are no surprise. But the Bojack Horseman Christmas Special and an episode of Black Mirror aren’t really traditional holiday fare. Love Actually makes the calendar, of course. So does The Ref (which is hilarious but full of curse words that would totally scandalize the grandparents). Oh, also Animal House is on this calendar, though whether it’s for you to aspire to a hard-partying holiday or just to be another surprising addition, we’re not sure. This calendar is a pretty perfect guide for our binge-watching this holiday season.",

      "text": "best netflix instant movies More This list is updated monthly to reflect recent availability and to showcase films currently streaming on Netflix, whether we’re talking classics or modern gems.\nNetflix offers roughly a gazillion different movies available through its streaming platform — well, approximately a gazillion. While the landmark service might become surprisingly accurate with its suggestions once you’ve been using it for a while, it’s still often tough to find something worth watching amid the trove of terrible choices.That being the case, we’ve taken the time to wade through the ridiculous amount of content in order to bring you a list of some of the best films currently available on Netflix. Planning your weekend has never been easier.\nRelated: Here’s what’s new on Netflix in December, and what’s going away\nView photos\nNew for December Animal House As a wise man once said, “there’s a time and place for everything… it’s called college.” Nothing exemplifies this point more than National Lampoon’s Animal House , a 1978 film that follows the mischievous antics of the scofflaw-riddled Delta Tau Chi fraternity in cartoonish fashion. After a series of events lands the fraternity on “double-secret probation,” the ragtag crew of misfits must get their act together or risk losing their charter. The timeless classic showcases stupendous performances from the likes of John Vernon and John Belushi, along with Donald Sutherland, Tim Matheson, and others. From the derelict toga party to Belushi’s cafeteria antics, the iconic scenes just keep coming. Will Delta house make things right with the Dean, or will it set its sights on its rivals and go out in a flaming ball of glory?\n+ Instant Queue\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coen Brothers’ sepia-toned adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey is a delightful romp through Depression-era Mississippi, one that follows three bumbling convicts — Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O’Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) — who escape their chain gang and set off in search of Everett’s buried treasure. Their journey takes them across a surreal vision of the South, as they encounter several characters and events inspired by episodes in the aforementioned epic. In addition to the dusty color palette, the film makes extensive use of period-appropriate music, including blues, gospel, and bluegrass tunes. It’s safe to say that T Bone Burnett’s production has never been so on point.\n+ Instant Queue\nBarry Told through a series of anecdotal moments dotting the college days of the 44th President of the United States, Barry is more of a coming-of-age story than Southside With You , writer-director Richard Tanne’s nostalgic journey through a day in the life of young Barack and Michelle Obama. Australian actor Devon Terrell plays the titular Barry with a surprising amount of depth and persuasion, rolling with the punches as he searches for an identity between the Columbia classroom and the Harlem projects. As he does, he juggles the privileges and the responsibilities that come with dating a white woman. Because of this, the film makes for a skillful examination of bi-racial America and cultural identity as a whole — the fact that the film is a nonfiction piece about a future president just makes it even more striking and relatable.\nRead More Coming December 16\nCaptain America: Civil War The opening salvo of the third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, predictably, spectacular. The titular “civil war” occurs when the opinions of Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) differ regarding control of the Avengers. The two leaders recruit teams for the ensuing clash, with characters such as Spiderman and the Black Panther making their first appearances in the MCU. However, despite the film’s cacophony of special effects and adrenaline-touched sequences, it somehow manages to balance an upwards of 10 comic book characters with plenty of gusto, while presenting a throng of thought-provoking ideas in its wake. Civil War represents Marvel at it’s most entertaining, and, dare we say, mature. Too bad we can’t say the same thing for D.C.’s Batman vs. Superman.. .\nComing December 25\nThe Rock While Michael Bay has never been known as a great director, his first feature film is a fun, restrained action flick. The Rock opens with a disgruntled general (Ed Harris) and a group of his most loyal men stealing chemical weapons and setting up a base on Alcatraz. When they demand a hefty ransom, the FBI plans a covert operation, sending chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage) to infiltrate the prison and disarm the weapons. In order to break into Alcatraz, however, he will need the help of the only man to have ever escaped the facility: John Mason (Sean Connery), a retired SAS captain. The remained of the film plays out like a buddy film, with Goodspeed and Mason getting on each other’s nerves as they try to thwart their enemies. Watching a manic Cage play off of the suave, no-nonsense Connery is just one of the film’s many delights .\n+ Instant Queue\nPirate’s Passage Made-for-TV movies are hit or miss. Pirate’s Passage falls in the former category, however, taking William Gilkerson’s novel of the same name and infusing it with colorful visuals, tremendous voice talent, and a fair share of adventure. The coming-of-age tale involves a 12-year-old boy from Novia Scotia and his mother, both of whom have fallen on hard times as a result of bullying and are struggling to hold on to the family inn. Things quickly change when an enigmatic sea captain (Donald Sutherland), who may or might not be a pirate who supposedly died more than 200 years ago, arrives on the scene to help out. The ensuing journey is exciting, creative, and — best of all — even somewhat enjoyable to adults.\n+ Instant Queue\nDocumentaries Amanda Knox Amanda Knox is a controversial figure — and a well-known one at that. In 2007, the foreign-language student and her boyfriend were wrongly convicted of murdering her fellow flatmate while in Italy, resulting in an eight-year legal battle that saw rampant misogyny, shaky forensic evidence, and shoddy journalism placed at the forefront. In the aptly titled Amanda Knox , directors Brian McGinn and Rod Blackhurst don’t so much recount the events as much as they examine the web of incompetence pervading the sexualized tabloid narrative, thus creating a riveting procedural that’s chock-full of enlightening interviews with Knox and those closest to her.\n+ Instant Queue\nBatkid Begins: The Wish Heard Around the World When Miles Scott was diagnosed with leukemia at just 18 months old, the youngster and his family became embroiled in a battle for survival. As he grew up living with the disease, Scott became fascinated by Batman, who was a symbol of hope while he was undergoing his difficult treatment. After years battling the disease, his parents teamed up with the Make-A-Wish Foundation in order to give their son a chance to be Batman for a day. What began as a simple event quickly blossomed into a massive campaign that brought together people from all over the globe — including iconic Batman actor Adam West and President Barack Obama — and turned San Francisco into Gotham City. Batkid Begins tells the story of how this now-viral story came to be, and moreover, does so beautifully.\n+ Instant Queue\nFinding Vivian Maier Sometimes the most fascinating mysteries stem from the unlikeliest of places. Historian John Maloof, for instance, purchased a box of negatives at a Chicago auction for a mere $400. The work turned out to be that of a Vivian Maier, a former nanny who spent her much of her time capturing exquisite photos in the bustling streets of Chicago in the late- 950s and ’60s. The discovery of Maier’s work upon her death eventually paved the way for a Kickstarter-backed film, Finding Vivian Maier , which centers on Maloof’s search for the unknown talent. The breezy narrative introduces Maier and her candid photography through an assortment of intriguing interviews with those who remember her, many of which shed light on a recluse who, for one reason or another, decided to stow away more than 150,000 photos before her death.\n+ Instant Queue\nJiro Dreams of Sushi You’ll never look at a California roll the same way again after watching this fascinating documentary about one of the best sushi chefs in the world. Jiro Ono, an 85-year-old legend in Tokyo, charges $300 a plate at his small restaurant. The film follows his never-ending quest to perfect the art of sushi, while also profiling his two sons, one of whom is poised to succeed Jiro and carry on the family tradition at the renowned restaurant (Sukiyabashi Jiro).\n+ Instant Queue\nIris\nAlbert Maysles’ penultimate film is a fitting portrait of a fashion icon who, surprisingly, still remains at the top of her game despite her advanced age. The 93-year-old subject is Iris Apfel, one of the most renowned fashionistas and interior designers to have ever trotted the globe. Maysles’ film depicts the stages of her life through a series of interviews, many of which contribute to a film that functions as both an ode to individual uniqueness and an intimate look into a marriage more than 65 years in the making. Apfel’s life (and home) might be cluttered, but it’s chock-full of charming insight more than anything else.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Wrecking Crew You’ve likely heard the Beach Boys’ “Good Vibrations” and the Ronettes’ “Be My Baby,” but you probably never knew that neither band played the instruments on either track. The Wrecking Crew chronicles the collective of L.A.-based studios musicians that did, while emphasizing just how integral the rotating cast of players were to some of the most iconic sounds of the ’60s. The nostalgia-steeped documentary is essentially an ode to these lauded, underappreciated musicians that lacks conflict but shines thanks to candid interviews.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Resurrection of Jake the Snake Aurelian Smith Jr. — better known by his ring persona, Jake “the Snake” Roberts — is a former professional wrestler who dominated the WWF in the late-’80s and ‘90s. As “The Snake,” Smith was notorious for conquering his opponents, taunting them, and even torturing them with his live snake, Damien the Python. Sadly, however, the former wrestler spent the better part of the following decades battling addictions to alcohol and crack cocaine, both of which took a heavy toll on his physical health, family, finances, and even Damien.\nThe Resurrection of Jake the Snake also follows fellow wrestler “Diamond” Dallas Page — who found post-wrestling success as a yoga teacher — and his efforts to rehabilitate Smith and Scott Hall, another friend and former WWE superstar. The candid doc sometimes feels like a reality show and an infomercial for Page’s enterprise, sure, but the interviews with wrestling greats such as Steve Austin, Chris Jericho, and Adam Copeland render it a comeback story with plenty to offer. Apparently, the only place to go from rock bottom is up .\n+ Instant Queue\nValley Uprising Right in the middle of the counterculture era, a group of brave, young individuals dedicated their lives to rock climbing. Set in Yosemite National Park, Valley Uprising tells the story of these young pioneers, who paved the way for the next generation of climbers. But don’t think you need to be a climbing enthusiast to enjoy this unique historical account. The directors masterfully utilize both vintage footage and digitally-animated archival photography to keep you on the edge of your seat, while incorporating a host of enlightening interviews with climbing legends such as Yvon Chouinard, Royal Robbins, Lynn Hill, and John Long. Many contemporary climbers, such as Dean Potter and Alex Honnold, also make an appearance. With fingers of steel, these scofflaws transformed climbing from a “fringe activity” to the respected sport it is today.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Ivory Game In this Netflix Original, filmmakers Kief Davidson and Richard Ladkani tell the story of the elephant poaching and the inner workings of the ongoing ivory trade — from the inside out. The film paints a dire picture of the economies, both political and financial, that have emerged as a result of ivory’s value in regions where legal loopholes allow the black-market commodity to move unfettered. From Africa to China to Italy, the film looks to expose the brutality of the ivory trade and help support those looking to make it extinct. It exists in the same vain as heartbreaking documentaries such as Blackfish and The Cove , and as such, it often feels more like a loudspeaker for animal-rights activists than a work of pure journalism. Thankfully, it’s a commanding watch either way .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Short Game Ever seen the excellent, 2002 documentary Spellbound ? Well, The Short Game is kind of like that, though it focuses on eight entrants in the 2012 U.S. Kids Golf World Championship and their overzealous parents instead of a national spelling bee in Washington D.C. Director Josh Greenbaum’s inspiring film follows the young athletes — five of whom are boys and three of whom are girls — beginning six months prior to the competition, profiling their athletic drive and personal interests in equal measure. Some of the athletes hog more of the spotlight than others, such as tennis superstar Anna Kournikova’s younger brother, but they all wind up participating in a competition that spurs both laughter and tears for the children and their parents.\n+ Instant Queue\nComedies Animal House As a wise man once said, “there’s a time and place for everything… it’s called college.” Nothing exemplifies this point more than National Lampoon’s Animal House , a 1978 film that follows the mischievous antics of the scofflaw-riddled Delta Tau Chi fraternity in cartoonish fashion. After a series of events lands the fraternity on “double-secret probation,” the ragtag crew of misfits must get their act together or risk losing their charter. The timeless classic showcases stupendous performances from the likes of John Vernon and John Belushi, along with Donald Sutherland, Tim Matheson, and others. From the derelict toga party to Belushi’s cafeteria antics, the iconic scenes just keep coming. Will Delta house make things right with the Dean, or will it set its sights on its rivals and go out in a flaming ball of glory?\n+ Instant Queue\nO Brother, Where Art Thou? The Coen Brothers’ sepia-toned adaptation of Homer’s Odyssey is a delightful romp through Depression-era Mississippi, one that follows three bumbling convicts — Ulysses Everett McGill (George Clooney), Pete Hogwallop (John Turturro), and Delmar O’Donnell (Tim Blake Nelson) — who escape their chain gang and set off in search of Everett’s buried treasure. Their journey takes them across a surreal vision of the South, as they encounter several characters and events inspired by episodes in the aforementioned epic. In addition to the dusty color palette, the film makes extensive use of period-appropriate music, including blues, gospel, and bluegrass tunes. It’s safe to say that T Bone Burnett’s production has never been so on point.\n+ Instant Queue\nFerris Bueller’s Day Off Any self-respecting movie buff has seen this movie more times than they can count, but we just couldn’t leave it off the list. The plot follows protagonist Ferris Bueller, who convinces his entire school that death is knocking at his door so he can skip school, then hits the streets of Chicago with his girlfriend and best friend for a day of complete and utter debauchery. It’s a warmhearted comedy about innocence and growing up, chock-full of Chicago landmarks and unforgettable scenes. Oh, ye h.\n+ Instant Queue\nMean Girls There’s no finer take on high school cliques than Tina Fey’s Mean Girls . The cult classic stars Lindsey Lohan as Cady Heron, a 16-year-old girl who is forced to attend public school once her family returns from a decade-long research trip in Africa. Lohan joins the school’s most exclusive outfit, but soon finds herself grappling with psychological status warfare when she falls in love with Aaron Samuels (Jonathan Bennett). It showcase girl-on-girl cattiness at its best (and funniest) .\n+ Instant Queue\nBurn After Reading Another day, another wacky comedy from the Coen brothers that quickly spirals way out of control. In this black comedy, a former CIA analyst (John Malkovich) loses a CD-ROM that contains meaningless ramblings on various government activities, many of which are intended for his soon-to-be memoir. When two certifiable dimwits (Frances McDormand and Brad Pitt) find the disc and think they’ve stumbled upon a treasure trove of valuable secrets, hilarity ensues. George Clooney and Tilda Swinton provide excellent supporting performances as well, but it’s the film’s neurotic score and the tight scripting that truly makes it an anti-spy thriller worthy of the Coen name.\n+ Instant Queue\nIn Bruges Ripe with dark humor, In Bruges showcases what might be Colin Farrell’s best performance . Though the oddball film features a gloomy premise that revolves around two hit men who must lay low at a bed-and-breakfast in Belgium until their boss contacts them, it finds an incredible amount of humor in its witty and sharply written script. Farrell is stupendous, whether portraying an offhanded killer or a fumbling lover.\n+ Instant Queue\nDazed and Confused Richard Linklater’s first coming-of-age comedy got its name from a Led Zeppelin song, which is fairly representative of the movie as a whole. Several of today’s Hollywood heavies, including Matthew McConaughey and Ben Affleck, appear in the film, which follows a group of high-school students as they prepare to finish the school year. Full of drugs, booze, and plenty of ‘70s-inspired hijinks, Dazed and Confused became a cultural touchstone to an entire generation of teenagers, one with an ensemble cast that’s nearly as good as its killer soundtrack.\n+ Instant Queue\nMoonrise Kingdom\nFew directors, writers, or producers showcase a visual or narrative style as distinct as Wes Anderson’s. The whimsical Moonrise Kingdom is one of his best to date. It tells the story of a young scout (Jared Gilman) and a bookish girl (Kara Hayward) who decide to run away together in an effort to temporarily escape their lives — and more so, the parental figures surrounding them. A beautiful, subdued palette makes this oddity of a film a joy to watch, while a tremendous supporting cast — which includes Bill Murray, Frances McDormand, Bruce Willis, and others — helps capture an eccentric summer filled with affairs and beachside portraits.\n+ Instant Queue\nClueless Another cult classic in the Mean Girls vein, Clueless adapts Jane Austin’s 1815 novel, Emma , and turns it on its head with a modern twist. It follows the wealthy and winsome Cher (Alicia Silverstone), a high-school student in Beverley Hills who sets out to unite two teachers and then popularize new student, Tai Frasier (Brittany Murphy). The lighthearted film spurred a book series, but much like the TV series of the same name, it wasn’t quite the sleeper hit the original film was.\n+ Instant Queue\nDramas Barry Told through a series of anecdotal moments dotting the college days of the 44th President of the United States, Barry is more of a coming-of-age story than Southside With You , writer-director Richard Tanne’s nostalgic journey through a day in the life of young Barack and Michelle Obama. Australian actor Devon Terrell plays the titular Barry with a surprising amount of depth and persuasion, rolling with the punches as he searches for an identity between the Columbia classroom and the Harlem projects. As he does, he juggles the privileges and the responsibilities that come with dating a white woman. Because of this, the film makes for a skillful examination of bi-racial America and cultural identity as a whole — the fact that the film is a nonfiction piece about a future president just makes it even more striking and relatable.\nComing December 16\nThe Big Short Based on a nonfiction book by Michael Lewis, The Big Short explores the systemic failures that led to the 2008 financial crisis through the lens of several men who saw the crisis coming and made millions by betting that the housing bubble would burst. The film is broken into several stories, all tied together by narrator Jared Vennet (Ryan Gosling), a trader whose path intersects with several of the characters. Director Adam McKay (of Anchorman fame) brings his usual flair for the kinetic and comedic, but here the satire is vicious rather than pleasant.\nBetween the meticulous planning of the protagonists and the frantic direction, The Big Short resembles a heist film, though the score is not a bank vault or rare painting, but the economy itself. The film is also educational, interspersed with strange, humorous segments meant to explain aspects of the housing market, such as Selena Gomez and economist Richard Thaler using a blackjack game to explain synthetic CDOs .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Imitation Game Benedict Cumberbatch gives a masterful performance as British codebreaker Alan Turing, whose ability to decipher the German Enigma machine proved vital to the Allied victory in World War II. Nominated for eight Academy Awards and a winner for Best Adapted Screenplay, director Morten Tyldum’s stirring film was lauded by the Human Rights Campaign for its portrayal of Turing’s legacy as a gay man. Keira Knightley and Charles Dance also shine in supporting roles.\n+ Instant Queue\nTitanic James Cameron’s take on the 1912 disaster has it all. The iconic film won Academy Awards for both Best Picture and Best Director, and subsequently spent 12 years at the top of the list of highest-grossing films of all time. It tells the story of Rose (Kate Winslet), now nearly 100 years old, who recalls her experience as a 17-year-old passenger aboard the ill-fated RMS Titanic, which hit an iceberg in the north Atlantic and sunk, killing more than 1,500 passengers. A strapping Leonardo DiCaprio plays Winslet’s beloved counterpart, who saves her from jumping overboard before the two helplessly — albeit, briefly — fall in love.\n+ Instant Queue\nBig Eyes A surprisingly tame film from nightmare sculptor Tim Burton, Big Eyes is based on the true story of Margaret Keane (Amy Adams), a painter whose husband, Walter (Christoph Waltz), took credit for her works, hoarding the fame and profits for himself. The movie largely traces the course of their relationship, from a meet-cute at an art show, to their divorce and subsequent court battle, while examining how their relationship grows strained and abusive along the way. Although it plays out like a traditional small-scale drama, Big Eyes has enough of Burton’s signature weirdness to keep the audience off-kilter.\n+ Instant Queue\nNo Country for Old Men The Coen Brothers are known for sprinkling even their bleakest films with moments of levity. Such isn’t the case with No Country for Old Men , however, a Western that stays true to the grim, fatalistic source material. Based on the Cormac McCarthy novel of the same name and set in Texas in the 1980s, the plot centers on Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin), a hunter who stumbles upon the remains of a drug deal gone wrong and a bag of money. Moss takes the money, not realizing that the bag contains a tracking device, and is quickly pursued by a Mexican cartel and Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem), an unstoppable hit man less concerned with the money than with teaching everyone he comes across a lesson.\nThe Coens are at the top of their game here; despite the savagery of its subject matter, this is one of the best-looking Westerns of all time. The Coens wisely leave much to the writing to McCarthy, only changing elements here and there, and actors like Bardem wring a great deal out of the sparse but heavy dialogue .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Sting Playing the “long con” has never been so profitable. In this critically acclaimed 1973 crime drama, Robert Redford and Paul Newman join forces to pull off one of the greatest cinematic capers of all time. Redford plays grifter Johnny Hooker, whose thieving ways land him in hot water with crime boss Doyle Lonnegan (Robert Shaw). Hooker flees to Chicago to find ex-con Henry Gondorff (Newman), and the two pair up to out-con Lonnegan in a film that won seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture.\n+ Instant Queue\nBoyhood So much has been said about the lengthy process behind Richard Linklater’s Boyhood — the film’s 12-year production cycle has been praised both as an undertaking and mocked as a gimmick — that the results are often overlooked. The film, which follows a boy named Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from childhood to his first day of college, is staggering in its portrayal of time. The film is made up of various vignettes from Mason’s life: a baseball game he attends with his father (Ethan Hawke), a high-school party, the small events that comprise a life even though they may not stand out.\nBy the time a teenage Mason creeps through the front door after a “little bit” of drinking and smoking, the weight of the years really hits. Like Mason’s mother (Patricia Arquette), whose attempts to balance work and motherhood form their own narrative, the viewer may be shocked how quickly everything went by.\n+ Instant Queue\nMystic River Mystic River is proof that Clint Eastwood is as masterful a director and composer as he is an actor. It’s a haunting and beautiful story, centered on three childhood friends who reunite later in life as the result of an investigation into the murder of one of their teenage daughters. It’s based on Dennis Lehane’s novel of the same name, and though the rampant profanity and unsettling outcome will likely upset you, the resounding performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins are enough to leave you floored when the last scenes of Boston fade out.\n+ Instant Queue\nSaving Private Ryan Director Steven Spielberg’s Saving Private Ryan defined the look and tone of almost all World War II-related media for decades to come. During the carnage of D-Day, three of four brothers enlisted in the U.S. military are killed in action. In order to keep the sole remaining brother alive, Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) of the 2nd Ranger Battalion gathers a squad of Army Rangers and embarks on a mission to save Pfc. James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper from the 101st Airborne division who has gone MIA in Normandy.\nMiller’s squad treks deep into war-torn France to search for the displaced soldier. From the opening moments at Omaha Beach to the final moments of the film, Captain Miller and his squad face the harrowing reality of combat in World War II, and build unshakable bonds that are formed between soldier during wartime. The all-star cast also includes Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Deisel, Giovanni Ribisi, Ted Danson, Jeremy Davies, Paul Giamatti, and Dennis Farina. Saving Private Ryan won five Academy Awards, including Best Cinematography and Best Director, and was nominated for six others, including Best Picture.\n+ Instant Queue\nBeasts of No Nation The Netflix-distributed film from director Cary Joji Fukunaga, the streaming service’s first original feature offering, traces the harrowing life of a child soldier (Abraham Attah) in a West African country who falls in line with a group of mercenaries and their larger-than-life commandant (Idris Elba). Elba is a powerhouse, both terrifying and charismatic. The film tackles the brutal atrocities of war with just the right amount of impact and implication. It’s certainly not an easy watch given the film’s more bold and bloody moments, yet is well worth watching.\n+ Instant Queue\nTo Kill a Mockingbird Robert Mulligan’s To Kill a Mockingbird has been heralded as a masterpiece ever since it first graced the silver screen in 1962. The heartfelt film is based upon Harper Lee’s Pulitzer-winning novel of the same name, which follows lawyer Atticus Finch (Gregory Peck) and the maelstrom of hate and prejudice that swirls around him as he works to defend an innocent black man (Brock Peters) accused of raping a white woman. In many ways, the film is a strong portrayal of how justice functioned in small-town Alabama, one that also examines the innocence of the Finch children and the special bond between a father and child. Peck’s incredible performance is also one for the books, so much so that his role has essentially become synonymous with the book character.\n+ Instant Queue\nSpotlight There are plenty of films about journalism, most of which are highly romanticized, but Spotlight is one of the few that gets it right. Based on the Boston Globe’s Pulitzer Prize-winning investigation into child sexual abuse in the Catholic Church, the film follows the principle members of the Globe’s Spotlight team as they delve into allegations against various priests in Boston. The team in question is a group of distinct personalities played by an all-star cast, including Michael Keaton, Mark Ruffalo, and Rachel McAdams. There is no flashy direction nor pyrotechnics here; director Tom McCarthy keeps things simple, focusing on the grim work of the investigators as they move forward inch by inch, connecting the various tiny pieces they need to craft their story.\n+ Instant Queue\nThrillers and Action Adventure Captain America: Civil War The opening salvo of the third phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is, predictably, spectacular. The titular “civil war” occurs when the opinions of Captain America (Chris Evans) and Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) differ regarding control of the Avengers. The two leaders recruit teams for the ensuing clash, with characters such as Spiderman and the Black Panther making their first appearances in the MCU. However, despite the film’s cacophony of special effects and adrenaline-touched sequences, it somehow manages to balance an upwards of 10 comic book characters with plenty of gusto, while presenting a throng of thought-provoking ideas in its wake. Civil War represents Marvel at it’s most entertaining, and, dare we say, mature. Too bad we can’t say the same thing for D.C.’s Batman vs. Superman.. .\nComing December 25\nThe Rock While Michael Bay has never been known as a great director, his first feature film is a fun, restrained action flick. The Rock opens with a disgruntled general (Ed Harris) and a group of his most loyal men stealing chemical weapons and setting up a base on Alcatraz. When they demand a hefty ransom, the FBI plans a covert operation, sending chemical weapons expert Stanley Goodspeed (Nic Cage) to infiltrate the prison and disarm the weapons. In order to break into Alcatraz, however, he will need the help of the only man to have ever escaped the facility: John Mason (Sean Connery), a retired SAS captain. The remained of the film plays out like a buddy film, with Goodspeed and Mason getting on each other’s nerves as they try to thwart their enemies. Watching a manic Cage play off of the suave, no-nonsense Connery is just one of the film’s many delights .\n+ Instant Queue\nPirates of the Caribbean: Curse of the Black Pearl Honestly, who thought a film based on a popular Disney attraction was going to be any good? That said, it surprised moviegoers and the populace as a whole with a score of iconic swashbuckling and classic pirate clichés that ultimately paved the way for far too many sequels. The premise for the original blockbuster centers on one Will Turner (Orlando Bloom), a blacksmith who sets out alongside pirate Captain Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp) to rescue Keira Knightley from the crew of undead pirates that call the Black Pearl home. Most of the performances are so-so, yet Depp’s is so original and iconic that he makes Geoffrey Rush’s nutty portrayal as Captain Barbarossa seem tame. The constant slurring and borderline drunken behavior certainly add to the effect.\n+ Instant Queue\nNightcrawler Jake Gyllenhaal has done exemplary work in the past — take Donnie Darko and Brokeback Mountain , for instance– but nothing quite compares to his eerie performance as TV stringer Louis “Lou” Bloom in Nightcrawler . The modern thriller, a resounding success for first-time director Dan Gilroy, follows an amateur journalist and former thief as he trolls the mean streets of Los Angeles looking for heinous accidents and crimes to capture on film. Gilroy’s script and vision is both dark and thought-provoking, however, it’s Gyllenhaal’s twisted charisma and his sordid actions as he navigates the unseemly business that truly bring the film to the forefront of recent neo-noir films.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Usual Suspects Noir films often play with perceptions, both the characters’ and the audience’s. This technique is taken to extremes in The Usual Suspects , a 1995 noir that opens with a massacre on a ship. Eager to find out what happened, customs agent Dave Kujan interrogates one of the two survivors, a frail con man named Verbal Kint (Kevin Spacey), who narrates the whole ordeal in a series of extended flashbacks. Kint and four other criminals, after meeting in a police lineup, decide to team up for a for a heist. When they inadvertently steal from an enigmatic crime boss named Keyser Söze, they are forced into taking on a job for him. Naturally, it’s all downhill from there. Christopher McQuarrie’s screenplay is one of the most acclaimed of all time, both for the sharp dialogue and the film’s brilliant structure. An outstanding cast, including Gabriel Byrne, Benicio del Toro, and Spacey, brings the dialogue to life, and their crackling rapport is a treat .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe African Queen The African Queen , first released in 1951, is a star-studded Hollywood classic. Directed by John Huston and co-starring Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn — two silver-screen legends — the film still holds up more than 60 years later. It was adapted from the C.S. Forester novel of the same name, and takes place East Africa in 1914. In the film, Bogart plays the surly captain of The African Queen , a steamboat that routinely delivers provisions and mail to a British missionary (Hepburn) in the remote village of Kungdu.\nOnce World War I ensues, however, Hepburn is stuck in enemy territory with nowhere to hide. Bogart agrees to help her escape on board his ship, and the former eventually convinces Bogart that the two must do their part to support the British war effort by sinking a nearby German warship. Disheveled and stuck within the limited confines of The African Queen , Bogart and Hepburn deliver one of the best dialogue-driven performances of the era — one that garnered Bogart his only Oscar. Needless to say, watching two masters of the craft share a stage isn’t something you see everyday.\n+ Instant Queue\nOnce Upon a Time in the West Once Upon a Time in the West is the direct result of the late Sergio Leone trying to retire from the same genre that made him an international icon in the mid-’60s. It’s a spaghetti Western at heart, one pertaining to an unyielding gunslinger named Frank (Henry Fonda) and the Western expansion of the railroad, but it also represents a notable shift from Leone’s earlier work. Regardless, its profound influence on filmmakers such as Quentin Tarantino and Martin Scorsese cannot be overstated, nor can its subtle irony or the ample references to previous Westerns and literature.\n+ Instant Queue\nInternational Girl with the Dragon Tattoo If you sat through the Daniel Craig version of author Stieg Larsson’s best-selling book and thought, “I wish there were at least six more hours of this,” then Swedish version of Larsson’s “Millennium” trilogy is surely for you. Girl with the Dragon Tattoo re-creates the books scene by scene, starting with an investigation into a 40-year-old case and ending with an engrossing murder and government conspiracy. Also, Noomi Rapace’s portrayal of the lead heroine is impeccable.\n+ Instant Queue\nAmelie Director-writer Jean-Pierre Jeunet’s Amelie remains the highest-grossing French film released in the United States — and for good reason. It’s the whimsical tale of a shy waitress in contemporary Paris who decides to return a collection of toys she found behind a baseboard in her apartment to their original owner, an act that helps her cope with her own isolation and despair after a difficult upbringing. Still, the film is warmhearted and quirky, with laughs to spare.\n+ Instant Queue\nIP Man There are hundreds — if not thousands — of kung fu movies on Netflix, but few of them are as good as the film dramatizing the life of Yip Man, one of Bruce Lee’s teachers and the first to teach Wing Chun martial arts in China. Film title controversy racked the film even before its debut in Hong Kong, and though we wouldn’t say the film is historically accurate when it comes to detailing Ip’s life in the city of Foshan during the Sino-Japanese War, the spectacular stunts make up for any inaccuracies.\n+ Instant Queue\nBlancanieves Spanish director Pablo Berger’s modern retelling of the classic Snow White story is not what you might expect — and the band of bullfighting dwarves and remarkable gladiatorial scenes don’t even begin to sum it up. The silent film is shot entirely in black-and-white and brims with an eerie sense of ambiguity and melancholia, which further capitalizes on the sadomasochism of the evil stepmother and inspiration drawn from the likes of horror masterminds such as Alfred Hitchcock and Tod Browning. It’s a dark portrayal of Spanish culture set in 1910, yet there’s also an unspoken beauty lining the vivid close-ups and flamenco-flecked score.\n+ Instant Queue\nOldboy Spike Lee should have never remade the South Korean Oldboy , especially with Josh Brolin in the lead role. The 2003 original — based on a manga and anchored in bloody, operatic anguish — is still a standout. In the film, Choi Min-sik plays a businessman who’s drugged, imprisoned, and tortured for 15 years before seeking revenge on his captors. It’s a statement, violent and maddening, with unforgettable scenes and a thought-provoking climax. There’s a reason Quentin Tarantino praised the film at the 2004 Cannes Film Festival.\n+ Instant Queue\nLiving is Easy with Eyes Closed Living is Easy with Eyes Closed is an appropriate title for this Spanish comedy, given the title is taken from a Beatles song and revolves around an English schoolteacher (Javier Camara) and two hitchhikers who go on a road trip across Spain in 1966 in the hopes of meeting John Lennon. The low-key film swept the country’s Goya Awards upon its release, and was even selected to represent Spain at the Academy Awards, owing to Camara’s winning performance and that of fledgling actress Natalia de Molina. It’s also based on a true story, one that takes a tender turn with the help of director David Trueba’s vision and subtle, political undertones.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Admiral: Roaring Currents South Korean director Kim Han-min’s look on the 1597 Battle of Myeongnyang is a David-and-Goliath tale of the highest caliber. It focuses on Korean admiral Yi Sun-shin — played by Choi Min-sik of Oldboy acclaim — and his efforts to thwart an encroaching fleet of 330 Japanese ships with little more than 12 of his own and a literal boatload of courage. However, the characters in the film are only secondary to the Michael Bay-esque action sequences strewn throughout, all of which seamlessly combine model warships and computer-generated effects to great effect. The way Sun-shin utilizes the currents and whirlpools to his advantage is captivating, even if Han-min doesn’t delve into the logistics of it all.\n+ Instant Queue\nOde to My Father South Korean director Yoon Je-kyoon’s Ode to My Father is teeming with political controversy — some feel it attempts to idealize the country’s past under the rule of a authoritarian regime — but that hasn’t stopped it from becoming one of the country’s most glorified films in recent years. The epic melodrama traces Korean history from the 1950s through the present day using the lens of one Yoon Deok-soo (Hwang Jung-min), an everyday refugee and shopkeeper who spends his life attempting to care for his family after the death of his father and sister. The film’s merit lies in its resounding ability to interweave historical events, such as the Hungnam Evacuation, with a concise narrative, while managing to wring a sentimental tone from the distant events.\n+ Instant Queue\nSci-Fi and Fantasy Upstream Color Upstream Color is the second film from auteur Shane Carruth, the mind behind Primer. Aside from directing and producing the piece, he also wrote it, starred in it, composed the music, and designed the sets. Such being the case , Upstream Color is a singular vision. The film follows Kris (Amy Seimetz), who falls prey to a strange hypnotic experiment that leaves her with memory loss, and her life entirely upturned. Months later, she meets Jeff (Carruth), with whom she discovers she shares an inexplicable, near-psychic link — one that extends beyond the two of them. Confused and overwhelmed, Kris and Jeff embark on a journey for answers. Upstream Color adheres to Carruth’s penchant for mind-bending, cerebral sci-fi that begs to be watched over and over again.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Road From director John Hillcoat comes The Road , a post-apocalyptic thriller based on Cormac McCarthy’s Pulitzer-winning novel of the same name. The film takes place years after an unspecified cataclysmic event has killed the vast majority of life on this planet — leaving the remaining pockets of civilization to break down down into lawless packs of cannibals — and follows a father (Viggo Mortensen) and son Kodi Smit-McPhee) as they struggle to make it through the forsaken wasteland with little more than a pistol. Packed with a feasible concept of societal entropy, the well-adapted drama is worth a watch (or three) even if you haven’t read the book. It’s horrifying, brutal, and haunting in the most beautiful way possible.\n+ Instant Queue\nBig Trouble in Little China Ignore the fact that Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson is starring in a remake of John Carpenter’s Big Trouble in Little China . The original film, starring Kurt Russell as trucker extraordinaire Jack Burton, has long been a cult classic. It appeased Carpenter’s long-standing desire to make a martial arts film when it was made in 1986. In the film, Burton faces off against an ancient sorcerer residing beneath San Francisco’s Chinatown. The movie’s premise is over-the-top, especially when you factor in the complicated special effects and the melange of canny references to other iconic films, but it’s the two-fisted Russell that truly gives it a timeless appeal .\n+ Instant Queue\nMetropolis Restored Fritz Lang’s 1927 masterpiece, Metropolis , may be one of the only silent films on our list, but it helped pioneer the sci-fi genre. The dystopian film revolves around a man of wealth (Gustav Fröhlich) who abandons his privileged life to join a band of oppressed workers in a revolt. The film was initially praised for its technical merits, though not as much for its plot or commentary on society as a whole, but has nonetheless become one of the defining films of the entire 20th century. It won’t blow you away visually, but its historical value outweighs its technical limitations .\n+ Instant Queue\nHard to be a God Truly thought-provoking sci-fi films seem rare these days, making gems like Aleksey German’s Hard to Be a God all the more precious. The experimental film begins with a group of scientists from Earth landing on a planet where humans also exist but have not progressed beyond the Middle Ages in terms of technology. One scientist, Anton (Leonid Yarmolnik), is dispatched to the Kingdom of Arkanar to help the locals progress. Taking on the identity of nobleman Don Rumata, he attempts to guide the kingdom into a new age, but must contend with the brutal Don Reba (Aleksandr Chutko). Hard to Be a God is a grim film, depicting a world where the land is as harsh as its people. At its core is the moral struggle of Rumata, whose directives prevent him from interfering directly with Arkanar’s advancement.\n+ Instant Queue\nTroll Hunter Although found footage felt like a novel idea when The Blair Witch Project premiered, the genre became stagnant after years of imitators. There are only so many times one can stand to watch someone run through a darkly lit house while screaming at nothing in particular, after all. The Norwegian film Troll Hunter mines some new depths of the genre by mixing some fantasy in.\nThe film opens with a trio of students investigating a suspected poacher. After finding the alleged poacher, Hans (Otto Jespersen), they follow him on one of his nightly excursions. What they discover is that Hans is not hunting bears, nor any animal. He is hunting trolls, massive creatures that turn to stone in the sunlight. The students decide to document his mission, despite the danger. Although Troll Hunter falls victim to some typical horror movie clichés — characters making blatantly irrational decisions, for examples — the unique creature designs set it far above the latest Paranormal Activity clones.\n+ Instant Queue\nV for Vendetta Alan Moore’s dystopian vision of Britain translates fairly well to the silver screen, with help from the iconoclastic Wachowski Brothers. In a country ruled by a fascist cabal, all information is regulated by the government, and the police maintain an iron grip on all aspects of life. When Evey (Natalie Portman), an employee for the state television network, is rescued from an assault by a masked man known only as V (Hugo Weaving), she is drawn into his campaign to overthrow the government. At first charmed by V’s passion and knowledge, she quickly finds that his methods might be too extreme for her taste. Excellent choreography and bold set design make V for Vendetta an exciting, if melodramatic, thriller .\n+ Instant Queue\nBlade II Blade, a human-vampire hybrid who protects humanity from the children of the night, is by far one of Marvel’s strangest characters to date. Blade II is the second film in the franchise, and the most well-regarded in the series. Directed by Guillermo del Toro (Pan’s Labyrinth), Blade II finds Blade (Wesley Snipes) striking an uneasy alliance with a group of vampires in an effort to take on The Reapers, a group of mutated vampires who seek to increase their ranks by spreading the “reaper virus” to humans and vampires alike .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Day the Earth Stood Still\nMuch like 2001: A Space Odyssey , director Robert Wise’s black-and-white vision of the short story Farewell to the Master is epic in both scope and vision. It remains one of the most influential sci-fi films of all time, revolving around an alien visitor (Michael Rennie) who comes to Earth with a mechanical companion and a message that will ultimately affect the future of the entire human race. Rennie and his cool, collected demeanor present a universal call for peace to those living during the Atomic Age, though many of the films sentiments still echo today. Now, if only the 2008 remake starring Keanu Reeves wasn’t such a catastrophe.\n+ Instant Queue\nA Trip to the Moon View photos\nTrip to the Moon Thumb More The legacy of Georges Méliès’ A Trip to the Moon cannot be understated, whether you prefer to watch the original silent film or opt for the remastered, hand-painted version that was first shown at the Telluride film festival. The pioneering work is often considered to be the first science fiction film and was widely considered a technical marvel upon release, one that dazzled exhibition-goers in 1902 and told the tale of a band of astronomers on an expedition to the moon. It’s overtly theatrical and incredibly short, but remains one of the most influential — and memorable — works in all of cinema to this day. The fact that French electronic duo Air soundtracked the remastered version doesn’t hurt, either.\n+ Instant Queue\nKids Pirate’s Passage Made-for-TV movies are hit or miss. Pirate’s Passage falls in the former category, however, taking William Gilkerson’s novel of the same name and infusing it with colorful visuals, tremendous voice talent, and a fair share of adventure. The coming-of-age tale involves a 12-year-old boy from Novia Scotia and his mother, both of whom have fallen on hard times as a result of bullying and are struggling to hold on to the family inn. Things quickly change when an enigmatic sea captain (Donald Sutherland), who may or might not be a pirate who supposedly died more than 200 years ago, arrives on the scene to help out. The ensuing journey is exciting, creative, and — best of all — even somewhat enjoyable to adults.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Jungle Book (2016) Disney’s recent rehash of Rudyard Kipling’s eponymous originals was something to behold at the box office, namely because of the superb CGI and the stunning cast of Hollywood heavyweights. The film still sees Mowgli & Co. return to the jungle to face evil tiger Shere Khan, except this time it’s no cartoon. The blue-ribbon voicework — which includes the likes of Christopher Walken, Scarlett Johansson, Bill Murray, and Idris Elba, among others — is just as impactful as the film’s gorgeous vistas, all of which capitalize on director-producer Jon Favreau’s keen sense of direction. It’s also one of the few remakes that’s actually faithful to its source material and better than its predecessor, which should render it appealing to children and adults alike.\n+ Instant Queue\nHow to Train Your Dragon 2\nThe second of three planned films, How to Train Your Dragon 2 expands on the hallmarks of its predecessor in every way imaginable. The animation is more vibrant and fluid, while the high-flying action sequences featuring the heroic Hiccup and his dragon Toothless are more invigorating and entertaining than ever before. The charming film is also chock-full of valid life lessons for kids, whether in regard to family or ecology or war. The family film takes cues from Star Wars and Game of Throne s, which provides it with an unexpected inkling of maturity and a vision that exceeds most animated endeavors in the same vein.\n+ Instant Queue\nZootopia Disney’s animated take on the odd couple schtick turns “buddy cop” into “bunny cop.” Zootopia follows rabbit police officer Judy Hopps (Ginnifer Goodwin) and small-time criminal fox Nick Wilde (Jason Bateman) as they investigate a string of disappearances tied to animals “going savage” and attacking one another. Though Zootopia is a kids movie through and through, adult themes like prejudice and stereotyping show up from time to time, making it an enjoyable experience for all. A superb voice cast featuring Idris Elba, Bonnie Hunt, J.K. Simmons, and more supports the excellent animation and writing. Zootopia , the second-highest-grossing film of 2016, hits all the right notes with any audience.\n+ Instant Queue\nPaddington The titular Paddington Bear is one of the most endearing and beloved characters in all of children’s literature, one first concocted at the hands of Michael Bond and a ragtag group of artists in the late-’50s. Thankfully, director Paul King’s family-friendly film adapts Paddington’s cheeky escapades for the 21st century without ceding the bear’s whimsical charm and penchant for marmalade. The live-action film makes heavy use of CGI — though, it does so beautifully — and manages to intersperse plenty of comical, good-natured gags with a few oriented toward mature audiences. For a film about a Peruvian bear who must acclimate to middle-class London after an earthquake rattles the rainforest he calls home, it’s more than bearable (pun intended).\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Secret of Kells The fabled Hayao Miyazaki isn’t the only director with a penchant for animated whimsy. Tomm Moore and Nora Twomey’s The Secret of Kells is a delightful romp steeped in Irish tradition and Celtic mythology, one that beautifully employs ornate design and luscious colors to tell the tale of a medieval monk (Evan McGuire) on a mission to save an enchanted forest and complete a storied book. The way the otherworldly images and story unfold on a flat, 2D plane is magnificent, as is the way the hand-drawn film meshes the ancient manuscript illustrations with modern animation. The ravenous wolves and dark forests of the film are as reliant on history as they are fantasy, and though they take a cue from a book first conceived in a remote Irish abbey more than a millennium ago, they do so with a contemporary twist that’s suited for children and adults alike.\n+ Instant Queue\nFantasia 2000\nThe original Fantasia was a sight to behold when it came out in 1940. It seamlessly blended classical orchestrations with brilliant animation, and its successor, Fantasia 2000, does the same. The mix of traditional and computer-generated imagery is fitting, as is the melange of lighthearted and conceptual pieces spanning the film’s eight shorts. Few sequences top the natural beauty of “Firebird Suite,” though, the restored version of “The Sorcerer’s Apprentice” from the original film comes damn close. And the image of Mickey in a wizard’s cap is still just as iconic.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Little Prince When French author and pilot Antoine de Saint-Exupéry sat down in his Central Park South apartment to write The Little Prince in 1943, he likely never anticipated the lasting impact the story would have on children’s literature. And while the original story tells the tale of a pilot — one who crash-lands in the Sahara and comes upon a young, golden-haired boy who lives on an asteroid — director Mark Osborne’s modern adaptation for Netflix is a two-part affair.\nMuch of the film centers around an overbearing mother ( Rachel McAdams) and her daughter ( Mackenzie Foy) , the latter of whom befriends a neighbor (Jeff Bridges) and quickly learns the story of the Little Prince. What follows is charming, dual narrative that brilliantly uses CGI and stop-motion animation to examine the essence of the human spirit, the compelling merits of exploration, and the strangeness of becoming a so-called “adult.”\n+ Instant Queue\nGoosebumps R.L. Stine’s best-selling horror tales were a staple for many a child, but only now has a proper film adaptation made it to the big screen. Director Rob Letterman’s (Gulliver’s Travels) rendition focuses on a teenage boy (Dylan Minnette) who moves in beside the writer in question, played by Jack Black. Eventually, the boy unleashes the monsters contained within some of the writer’s most well-known books. The nostalgic plot isn’t any more complicated than that, and the film features entertaining performances from everyone involved. It’s breezy, carnival-esque nature is sure to spook your kids without keeping them up at night.\n+ Instant Queue\nHorror The Babadook One of the most original horror movies of the past decade, The Babadook is a tense thriller sure to have you on the edge of your seat. The story follows Amelia, a widowed single mother who attempts to help her son Samuel overcome his arresting fear of monsters. After stumbling upon a book depicting a horrific, shadow-dwelling monster called the Babadook, both mother and son start feeling an eerie presence in their house. Several attempts to destroy the book fail, leaving both Samuel and Amelia in a constant frenzy to stay alive and avoid the sinister Babadook.\n+ Instant Queue\nTucker and Dale vs. Evil The premise behind Tucker and Dale vs. Evil revolves around a simple misunderstanding. A gang of college undergrads on a weekend getaway mistake two backwoods rednecks, played by Alan Tudyk and Tyler Labine, for psychotic killers after the duo saves a young girl who falls in the water and gets knocked unconscious. The ensuing comedic ride is a one-trick pony, yet it’s also one lined with a stream of upended clichés that are equally funny and horrific. The slapstick violence and solid performances, particularly from Tudyk and Labine, also imbue the Canadian flick with an air of uniqueness in an otherwise tepid field — even before one of the kids accidentally jumps into the wood chipper and the bodies start to pile up .\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Fly While David Cronenberg’s 1986 remake of The Fly is great in its own right, the 1958 original version is a horror staple. Chock-full of retro effects and vintage blood-curdling screams, The Fly centers on a recently widowed spouse and an experiment gone terribly wrong. After scientist Andre Delambre builds a controversial teleportation machine, he accidentally swaps parts of his body with a fly passing by the machine. Now his head and arm resemble that of a fly while the fly packs Andre’s human head and arm. As strange as it sounds, The Fly is classic horror at its finest and a must-watch for any fan of old-fashioned scares .\n+ Instant Queue\nSweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street An adaptation of Stephen Sondheim’s stage musical, Tim Burton’s Sweeney Todd finds the director pairing his distinct gothic wonderland aesthetic with appropriately ghoulish source material. The story follows Benjamin Barker (Johnny Depp), a barber who has returned to London after spending years in prison for a crime he did not commit. The man who sentenced him, Judge Turpin (Alan Rickman), did it so that he could rape Barker’s wife; now, he is the guardian of Barker’s child. Eager for revenge, Barker adopts the alias of Sweeney Todd and opens a new barbershop, hoping to become successful enough to lure Turpin in for a shave and murder him. Unfortunately, Todd cannot control his violent urges, and uses various customers for appease those tendencies. A musical is nothing without great music, and Sweeney Todd is some of Sondheim’s best work, catchy and beautiful, dark and often humorous. Depp captures Todd’s barely concealed menace, but the real stars are supporting cast members such as Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and Sacha Baron Coen (playing the foppish rival barber, Adolfo Pirelli).\n+ Instant Queue\nJaws Steven Spielberg’s Oscar-winning 1975 thriller based on the novel of the same name ushered in the very concept of the summer blockbuster, and has maintained its status as one of the greatest films ever made. Jaws begins on the sleepy island town of Amity during a busy and hot summer season. After discovering the human remains from a shark attack, the town’s sheriff, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), attempts to convince the mayor to close the beaches, despite steep opposition. When another attacks claims the life of a child, the island is swamped by amatueur shark hunters looking to claim the bounty on the animal’s head.\nBrody joins up with fisherman Quint (Robert Shaw), and Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss), a scientist from the Oceanographic Institute, and the trio embark on a hunt for the killer shark. The final act of the film culminates in a deadly confrontation that is still emulated by many films today and set a new bar for special effects at the time. When the film was originally released, it caused such a panic among those who saw it that it resulted in several incidents across the country where beachgoers were frightened by things they mistook for sharks. From the classic score and quotable dialogue to the way it changed how audiences looked at the ocean, Jaws is a ttimeless film..\n+ Instant Queue\nHush Appearing out of nowhere at South by Southwest, director Mike Flanagan’s Hush is a surprising thriller, one that adds a unique twist to the classic slasher formula. The 2016 film follows Maddie Young (Kate Siegel), a deaf author who lives in a house out in the woods. Maddie’s peaceful existence is disrupted one night when a masked man (John Gallagher Jr.) kills her neighbor and then proceeds to stalk her. Although the killer tries to toy with her at first, Maddie is clever, and they swap roles in a game of cat-and-mouse played out over the course of the night. Hush is a simple film, focusing more on tension than actual twists, and is a must-see for horror fans who have grown tired of blunt thrillers that try too hard to be shocking.\n+ Instant Queue\nSleepy Hollow When first released in 1999, Sleepy Hollow was the strangest and most fully-realized of Tim Burton’s works since Batman Begins . It was based on Washington Irving’s short story, The Legend of Sleepy Hollow , which reeled around New York detective Ichabod Crane (Johnny Depp) and his investigation into the deaths of a host of decapitated victims. The charismatic cast and excellent set design give what would be an excessive slasher flick its true character, while Depp’s steadfast performance and the film’s bizarre special effects endow an age-old tale with a modern touch.\nIt all makes for a film that excels when it comes to atmosphere, even if the tongue-in-cheek nature of the story sometimes retracts from the film’s overall image. And if that weren’t appealing enough, it features a dude who stalks the town headless…\n+ Instant Queue\nCujo “It’’s not a monster; it’s just a doggie.” Or is it? The apt-titled Cujo is a cult-classic based on Stephen King’s best-selling novel of the same name. At first, Cujo is just your average, cuddly St. Bernard. However, once bitten by a rabid bat, the dog quickly transforms into a snarling, bloodthirsty beast that’s hellbent on maiming anything in his four-legged path. Donna Trenton (Dee Wallace) and her son (Danny Pintauro) star as the canine’s owners, both of which spend the majority of the film holed up within a stalled Ford Pinto, hiding from their beloved pet as he attempts to wait them out. The film might be comical at times — it was made in 1983, after all — but it benefits from a level of unpredictability that renders it far better than anything in the Beethoven heptalogy. Now, if only Cujo knew to aim for the Pinto’s defective gas tank….\n+ Instant Queue\nA Girl Walks Home Alone at Night Tagged as “the first Iranian vampire Western,” A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is screenwriter Ana Lily Amirpour’s directorial debut, and one that has critics calling her the next Quentin Tarantino. Based off Amirpour’s graphic novel of the same name, the film takes place in an Iranian ghost town called Bad City, where a lonely vampire stalks the streets, unbeknownst to its citizens. Viewers follow Arash, a teenager battling with the fact that his father is a drug addict and the notion he may have fallen in love with a vampire. A Girl Walks Home Alone at Night is one of the most original takes on the vampire genre in years.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Cabinet of Dr. Caligari Director Robert Wiene’s The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari is a strange film by all accounts, yet it’s often considered the quintessential work of German Expressionist cinema and arguably the first horror film in existence. A multitude of jagged landscapes and sharp angles punctuate the 1921 film’s bizarre cinematography — giving the silent film about an evil hypnotist, an asylum inmate, and a psychiatrist an added depth of surrealism and two-dimensional mystique. Other cubist-esque touches and techniques further define its visual flare. Looks aside, the iconic film serves as an enduring exposé on the mental state of Francis (Friedrich Feher), serving both as a vessel for examining the duality of human nature and our owns perceptions of reality. It’s likely not, as some claim, a premonition of the rise of Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party, but that doesn’t render it any less unnerving.\n+ Instant Queue\nRomance Jane Eyre If Mia Wasikowska ever stops starring in period dramas, we’ll probably cry. Her portrayal of the titular character saves director Cary Joji Fukunaga’s film from sliding into melodrama and turns it into a tantalizingly slow-paced, magnetic piece. Drama comes in the small moments, subtle facial expressions, and charged dialogue. Michael Fassbender’s Rochester is also stormy without falling into the trap of being absurdly so. When the film does finally come to its climax, the determined inner strength that Wasikowska lends to Jane carries her, and the film, to its denouement.\n+ Instant Queue\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s Truman Capote’s brilliant novel about an unlikely connection between a struggling writer and a New York socialite was the toast of literary circles. The film adaptation — which sees Audrey Hepburn playing the iconic Holly Golightly — did wonders with Capote’s written word and faithfully re-creates this wonderful, romantic tale. George Peppard and Mickey Rooney also star in the film, though it’s Hepburn’s performance which easily steals the show.\n+ Instant Queue\nGrease This 1978 musical based upon the Broadway show of the same name cemented John Travolta as a superstar in American cinema. Set in 1958, the film follows teenage greaser Danny Zuko (Travolta) as he tries to find love (and look cool doing it). Co-starring Olivia Newton-John, Jeff Conaway, and Stockard Channing, Grease balances innocent summer love with heaps upon heaps of American movie tropes — street racing, gang warfare, poorly timed marriage proposals — to create one of the most popular movies and one of the best-selling soundtracks of all time .\n+ Instant Queue\nTo Catch a Thief Filmed in 1955 on the breathtaking French Riviera and directed by the master of suspense himself, Alfred Hitchcock, To Catch a Thief still stands the test of time more than 60 years later. Grace Kelly plays the beautiful American heiress Frances Steven, who’s on holiday in Europe, while Cary Grant plays John Robie, a former cat burglar who has since retired to a life of leisure. After a string of robberies point to Robie as the potential culprit, he must clear his name by finding the criminal. Who better to catch a thief than a former thief? Who better to steal the girl than Cary Grant?\n+ Instant Queue\nSixteen Candles Few directors have ever captured the joys, angst, and absurdity of teenage life better than John Hughes. In Sixteen Candles , Hughes focuses on the highs and lows of young love and unrequited affection. Molly Ringwald stars as Samantha Baker, a high school sophomore whose 16th birthday has been overshadowed by her older sister’s wedding. Her grandparents have come to stay for her sister’s wedding, bringing with them their foreign exchange student, Long Duk Dong (Gedde Watanabe). The day becomes much more complicated when Sam’s crush, Jake Ryan (Michael Schoeffling), winds up in possession of a note detailing Sam’s sexual history — or lack thereof — and, worse, her feelings for him. Meanwhile, Ted (Anthony Michael Hall), a young freshman, makes a wager with his group of geeky friends that he will sleep with Sam, but after several failed attempts, ends up aiding Sam in her quest to win Jake’s affection. While Sixteen Candles is a nostalgic jaunt back to the mid-’80s, its story and humor are familiar and timeless to anyone who’s ever experienced high school romance.\n+ Instant Queue\nShakespeare in Love It’s easy to knock Shakespeare in Love , however, you probably shouldn’t. Although the witty film stands on its own, depicting a fictional love affair between Viola de Lesseps (Gwyneth Paltrow) and a young Shakespeare (Joseph Fiennes) while he’s writing Romeo and Juliet , it also functions as an ode to the playwright’s sterling collection of works. Allusions abound in the form of passionate love and politics, both of which play on a fair share of topical references. It even showcases a contemporary sense of humor and solid performances — particularly Paltrow — along with more sweetness than a white chocolate mocha from Starbucks.\n+ Instant Queue\nThe Princess Bride The Princess Bride begins in the late 1980s as a young boy (Fred Savage) spends the day home from school sick. While in bed, his grandpa (Peter Falk) reads him a book called The Princess Bride , a fairy tale about the young maiden Buttercup (Robin Wright) and Westley (Cary Elwes), aka the farmhand with whom she falls in love. Although Westley sets out with dreams of finding a fortune to support himself and Buttercup, his dreams are cut short when his ship is attacked by the notorious Dread Pirate Roberts and he is presumed dead. Buttercup later agrees to marry Prince Humperdink (Chris Sarandon) following years of heartbreak and distress, only to be kidnapped by a ragtag trio of bandits before the wedding. As the gang flees the to the countryside, however, a mysterious man in black trails them. And unbeknownst to Buttercup or her captors, the Man in Black is none other than Westley, who not only survived the attack but vows to free his beloved.\n+ Instant Queue\nCinema Paradiso Giuseppe Tornatore’s foreign drama Cinema Paradiso took the award circuit by storm in 1989, bagging a Golden Globe and an Academy Award as that year’s “Best Foreign Language Film.” The movie revolves around a celebrated film director who reflects back on his childhood spent at Cinema Paradiso, a theater that helped foster his love for films. The director returns to his former home at a Sicilian village, where he reminisces about Elena, his first love and the one who got away when he moved to Rome some 30 years prior. A beautiful love story sure to make you bawl your eyes out, Cinema Paradiso is top-notch filmmaking.\n+ Instant Queue\nNeed something to watch?

Nothing, that's what.With Halloween behind us, it's time to set our sights on the holiday season. That means lots of twinkle lights, hot chocolate, and holiday music. But it also means that there will be tons of holiday movies available to stream on all your favorite apps and sites for the next few months. And what better way to get into the holiday spirit than with your old pals Netflix, HBO Go, Amazon Instant Video and Hulu?Consider this your ultimate movie playlist. Many of these are holiday classics; some are feel-good films that make you feel a little less Grinch-like, and all are available to stream online. All you need now is to hire an elf to keep the eggnog and Christmas cookies coming. Begin Slideshow ",

      "text": "Netflix's 'Jedi Junior High' a feel-good look at adolescence McKenna Park, Deseret News - mckennaleepark@gmail.com 21 hrs ago \n(courtesy) \n(courtesy) \n\"JEDI JUNIOR HIGH\" — 3 stars — written and directed by Heidi Burkey and Tim Larson, TV-PG, Netflix \nHeidi Burkey and Tim Larson’s documentary is a fun mix of adolescent quirkiness, lightsaber fights and musical theater. “Jedi Junior High,” which was first released in 2014 and became available on Netflix Nov. 15, lightheartedly follows a cast of junior high students as they prepare to perform in a musical parody of the iconic film “Star Wars Episode V: The Empire Strikes Back.” \nFrom auditions to opening night, the documentary captures the challenges and the triumphs of putting on a large production with children who at times still struggle to focus on simple tasks. \nThroughout the interviews with the young cast, viewers will no doubt be brought back to their own junior high days of awkwardness and self-discovery. Producing a play called \"Star Wars: The Musical\" attracted a variety of kids to auditions who displayed a range of personalities. \nShy and sweet 12-year-old Jonathan Graham, who just wished he could be a bit more popular, was ironically cast as Han Solo. \n“He’s the guy who doesn’t really care about anything,” Graham said in the film. “But for me, I feel like I’m the goody-two-shoes.” \nOn the other side of the spectrum, charismatic Alexander Ortiz has more of a Han personality, yet the 13-year-old is cast as Luke in the musical. \nThe heart of the film is not Star Wars or theater; it is young kids growing and beginning to find their place. The documentary draws a parallel between the hero’s journey Luke undertakes and the coming-of-age journey all kids experience. This analogy is underlied by the interviews of both the kids and their parents as they speak on the hardships of growing out of the safety and security of childhood to adulthood, with its ever-broadening choices and danger. \nWhile the camera work and overall quality of this documentary discloses its low-budget filming, it does not interfere with its storytelling. In this simple, small, delightful story, fancy camera work and professional moviemaking equipment is not needed to convey its messages. \n“Jedi Junior High” is classified as a documentary, yet it could fit well into a secondary category of comedy. Audiences will surely chuckle as the young actor playing Chewbacca explains how he was forced to audition and complains about his uncomfortable costume. And it is always funny and sweet to watch the immature development of affections and crushes among groups of hormonal youths. \nWhile those who lean more towards action and excitement in their movie choices might find themselves bored midway through “Jedi Junior High,” parents and kids alike will enjoy watching the young cast’s journey tackling a big musical. Any Star Wars fan will also appreciate the frequent discourse about the franchise, along with the children’s representation of the iconic characters. Overall, “Jedi Junior High” is a lighthearted film fit for a family movie night. \n“Jedi Junior High” is rated TV-PG; running time is 74 minutes.

      "text": "Netflix's business is growing rapidly, well above the S&P 500 average investment. \nThe company is a potential takeover target of larger entertainment giants like Disney. \nNetflix stock is experiencing strong momentum and buying in the second half of 2016. \nWhile none of hundreds of blue chips I follow are currently in a clear buy entry position as outlined by all the criteria of my Victory Formation system during early December, Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is closest. It is quite likely that a substantial pullback in the general stock market could generate a nice long purchase window soon. Specifically, a retest of the gap from $107 in October on a 10% U.S. equity market correction would be an interesting development. \nClick to enlarge \nAs a standalone enterprise, Netflix is projected by Wall Street consensus ( reported by Yahoo Finance ) to grow earnings at a robust 70% compounded annual rate the next five years as mobile internet video streaming takes hold, albeit off a low base number of $0.40 a share in 2016. Sales growth of 30% in 2016 is expected to run closer to 25% annually in coming years. While few large capitalization equities can boast a similarly high expected rate of profit increase, Netflix also may offer takeover bait upside. \nTakeover Potential \nAbsent a general market swoon in December, Netflix may continue to zig-zag higher. Clearly, internet delivery of content and video is a desirable business model on Wall Street in 2015-2016. Verizon (NYSE: VZ ) purchased America Online last year, and is adding Yahoo (NASDAQ: YHOO ) assets this year. AT&T (NYSE: T ) is trying to buy the remaining Time Warner (NYSE: TWX ) content business after it sold its cable operations to Comcast (NASDAQ: CMCSA ). \nIn this vein, investors and analysts have been debating the possibility of a Disney (NYSE: DIS ) takeover of Netflix as a way for Disney to leapfrog most all competitors into the leading position for internet delivery of streaming video, music and movies. To be honest the idea of such a hook-up is appealing, despite the steep price (estimated at $60-$70 billion for a Netflix takeover value). Just a few months ago Disney seriously contemplated taking over Twitter (NYSE: TWTR ) for substantially less upfront, but decided against. \nNetflix has unequalled brand recognition in the internet media delivery business and a present user base of 86 million streaming members in 190 countries. The upside for Netflix's future is truly astonishing the next 10-20 years as global internet infrastructure is built out, given the right partner with deep pockets for marketing and technology development. \nDisney As Suitor \nA combination of Disney's content library and brand name reputation with Netflix's technology and reach would create \"the\" hands down leader for internet-based entertainment. Companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ), Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ), Viacom (NYSE: VIA ), CBS (NYSE: CBS ), Fox (NASDAQ: FOXA ), Verizon, AT&T and Comcast might end up fighting for second place. I would argue the beauty or saving grace of a Disney-Netflix partnership would be the synergies of their higher margin operating businesses. Without the extraordinary cost of cable, cell tower or fiber infrastructure investment, the two would focus on content creation and the software backbone of internet entertainment, whether mobile, computer or television viewed. \nA $150 per share Netflix takeover price, using an all share purchase of the company by Disney (no cash or debt), would bring a combined $220 billion equity capitalization, with $20 billion in long-term debt, $60 billion in total liabilities, $10 billion in depreciated \"tangible\" book value, plus $10 billion in GAAP earnings annually based on present Wall Street estimates for both corporations. The new entity would have an estimated $12-13 billion in \"free\" cash flow generation yearly, including $2+ billion extra amortization of buyout goodwill. Theoretically, the new company could use free cash flow to become debt free in two years and liability free in five years, without slowing growth rates dramatically. The unified effort would have a unique and super-high 2016-17 gross profit margin of 40% and net profit margin of 15% of revenues. \nThe biggest question is what kind of growth trend would be expected from a combination. Wall Street's valuation of the new business model would look far different than today's less than robust growth profile for Disney alone. The 2017-18 growth rates for sales would bump from 5% to 10% and profits from 10% to 15% annually on the new enterprise, using my own estimates. You can easily argue Netflix's results would pick up beyond the current 25%-30% sales expansion rate of 2016-17 if global entertainment conglomerates had to deal with Disney's new leading position as internet media marketer to the world. If you cannot beat them, join them … would be the equation as a Disney/Netflix combo becomes ridiculously difficult to compete against. \nUpside Momentum Building \nNetflix's stock price has been performing strongly the last six months. As pictured below, the company is beating the S&P 500, the Nasdaq Composite and other top U.S. internet delivery and entertainment conglomerates over various time periods since the summer. \nClick to enlarge \nClick to enlarge \nConclusion \nNetflix seems to be garnering extra investor attention of late as a potential takeover target. There exists plenty of Wall Street interest in the company's leading position delivering entertainment and media over the internet. With the right buyer, growth rates could increase beyond the company's already well above S&P 500 average trend of 2016. A December sell-off would be a welcome development for growth oriented investors to initiate purchases. However, strong buying momentum may carry the stock quote higher, regardless of overall market direction or specific takeover news. As always, do your own due diligence and invest wisely in a diversified, uncorrelated portfolio of assets. Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, but may initiate a long position in NFLX, DIS over the next 72 hours.   it (other than from Seeking Alpha).

      "text": "Amazon \n\"The Grid\" is a perfect example of how Bill Gates thinks about book genres the way Netflix thinks about TV and movies. \n\"This book, about our aging electrical grid, fits in one of my favorite genres: 'Books About Mundane Stuff That Are Actually Fascinating,'\" he writes. \nGrowing up in the Seattle area, Gates' first job was writing software for a company that provided energy to the Pacific Northwest. He learned just how vital power grids are to everyday life, and \"The Grid\" serves as an important reminder that they really are engineering marvels. \n\"I think you would also come to see why modernizing the grid is so complex,\" he writes, \"and so critical for building our clean-energy future.\"",

      "text": "Luke Cage Will Be Back on Netflix—But When? \nThe Marvel superhero will return to Harlem. Netflix By Emma Dibdin Dec 5, 2016 Luke Cage will return for a second season, following in the footsteps of fellow Marvel/Netflix heroes Daredevil and Jessica Jones . Netflix confirmed the news via the show's Twitter and Facebook feeds over the weekend, with \"Season 2 Coming Soon\" glowing in neon through the window of Pop's Barber Shop. \n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below But take that \"coming soon\" with a grain of salt—there's no release date set, and Netflix has at least three other Marvel shows to get in the can first. Ensemble series The Defenders and Jon Bernthal spinoff The Punisher are currently filming, while the second season of Jessica Jones is due to begin production sometime next year. Daredevil has also been renewed for Season Three, so that may also need to slot in first. The good news is that Mike Colter's Luke will appear in The Defenders alongside Krysten Ritter's Jessica, Charlie Cox's Daredevil, and Finn Jones's Iron Fist, so you won't have to wait until 2019 for your fix of Harlem-based heroics.

      "text": "\nI love a good Netflix binge-watch. So when the weather gets a little colder, the nights a little darker, sometimes a good Netflix marathon and a few “are you still watching?” messages are needed to get you through. If you’re looking to invest in a new show during some downtime this holiday season, we’ve broken down a couple worth noting – or in this case – watching.\nNetflix gets your interests Netflix is the King of content creation. With a number of award-winning, smash hits including Orange is the New Black , House of Cards , and Making a Murderer , Netflix has become a personalized content delivery platform that serves you the content that you want to see, to the best of its ability.\nIn 2016, Entertainment Weekly reported that Netflix would be spending six billion dollars over the year to create over 600 hours of original programming. On top of that, the streaming service released 45 original shows in 2016 (not including documentaries or kids shows) as shared by Business Insider .\nWe took the liberty of analyzing the audiences of a few of these shows to see who the shows are already attracting. Chances are, if you fall into any one of these interest-based communities, you’ll find this show on your Netflix browser sometime soon (or already there!)\nWho’s Watching The Get Down ? \nHaving premiered on Netflix in August of this year, The Get Down is an American musical drama series set in the Bronx neighbourhood of New York City in the 1970s. The series’ storyline depicts how the poverty-ridden Bronx neighbourhood gave birth to a flourishing hip-hop and disco music scene.\nUsing Affinio we analyzed the followers of @TheGetDown who self-describe as living in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nCommunities of Rap Music Fans, Teens who are passionate about #BlackLivesMatter, and a surprising pocket of Marvel and Action Film Movie Fans appear in the audience.\nAdding my two cents, if you’re a fan of music and like a cinematic experience this show is amazing!\nWho’s Watching Lady Dynamite ? \nHaving premiered on Netflix on May 20, 2016, Lady Dynamite is a comedy series that is loosely based on the life of comedian/actress Maria Bamford (who portrays herself in the show). The storyline follows Bamford as she moves home to LA and rebuilds her life after spending time in rehab for bipolar disorder.\nUsing Affinio, we analyzed the 1,934 followers of @TheLadyDynamite who self-describe as living in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nThis small audience has already attracted communities of Comedians, Podcasters, Political Writers, and a Brooklyn-based community of writers.\nWho’s Watching The Ranch ? \nReleased on Netflix on April 1, 2016, The Ranch is a comedy series that takes places on a fictional Colorado ranch, Iron River Ranch, and follows the life of the dysfunctional Bennett family that owns it.\nUsing Affinio, we analyzed the followers of @TheRanchNetflix who self-describe as living in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nCommunities of WWE Fans, Gamers, Sports Fans, and Country Fans are found within this small audience.\nWho’s Watching Haters Back Off ? \nReleased on Oct 14. 2016, Haters Back Off is an extended version of the cringe-worthy YouTube character, Miranda Sings , portrayed by Colleen Ballinger. The storyline follows real-life actress/comedian/writer/YouTuber Colleen Ballinger in her “Miranda” character, an untalented girl who seeks fame on YouTube by posting singing videos.\nUsing Affinio, we analyzed the followers of @HatersBackOff who live in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nWe can see in the audience visualization that many of these clusters are closely related and have shared interests. The majority of these clusters such as Teen Girl YouTubers and Gamer YouTubers spawn from the video platform. We can also see a cluster of Colleen Ballinger Super Fans which isn’t surprising since she has accumulated a following of over 4 million viewers on her YouTube channel.\nWho’s Watching Luke Cage ? \nReleased on Sep. 30, 2016, Marvel’s Luke Cage is a Netflix series based on the Marvel Comics character Luke Cage. The storyline takes place in the Marvel Universe and follows Cage, a former convict with superpowers who now fights crime.\nUsing Affinio, we analyzed the followers of @LukeCage who live in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nCommunities of WWE Fans, Gamers, Sports Fans, and of course, Marvel Fans, are found within this audience. Looking at these communities, we can infer that these communities like action-packed entertainment!\nWho’s Watching The Crown ? \nNetflix’s latest and greatest, released on Nov. 4, 2016, The Crown depicts the life of a young Elizabeth II, Queen of England, from her wedding day in 1947 to present day. One month after its release, the show has already been renewed for a second season.\nUsing Affinio, we analyzed the followers of @TheCrownNetflix who live in the USA. Below is the audience visualization of the interest-based communities initially attracted to the show:\n\nCommunities such as Royals Enthusiasts, Political News Enthusiasts, and Pop Culture Mommies have been initially attracted to the show.\nNetflix has something for everyone One of the greatest things about Netflix is that there is something for everyone! The shows we’ve analyzed attract a wide variety of interest-based communities, from wrestling fans to political junkies. This showcases that television audiences are diverse and the content of a show and the audiences watching might surprise you!\nDo you fall into any of these interest-based communities? Perhaps you should try a new show this Christmas. Based on my interests, I’ll be tuning into The Crown. Originally posted on Affinio , “ Your Holiday Binge-Watching Guide to Netflix Originals “\n",

      "text": "  \n(Faceook/Sense8TV) \"Sense8\" season 2 will premiere on May 5, 2017. \nNetflix has a holiday treat for all \"Sense8\" fans as it has been revealed that a two-hour Christmas special will premiere on Dec. 23. Season 2 of the sci-fi drama series will consist of 10 episodes, with the first one debuting in May. \nA teaser photo of the Christmas special was shared by the official Twitter handle of the series. The image shows Tina Desai's Kala and Max Riemelt's Wolfgang looking deeply at each other. — Sense8 (@sense8) December 5, 2016 \nThe plot of the Christmas special remains vague, with Netflix only providing a general description of what is to come. \n\"The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other's lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself,\" the description reads. Advertisement \nAs for season 2, it has been said that it will be more daring than the first in that it will be \" pushing the boundaries .\" The upcoming season will also have more violence and sex. \nFans are also wondering what will happen with the love triangle involving Kala, Wolfgang, and Rajan (Purab Kohli). The first season saw Kala and Rajan together, but Kala found herself becoming increasingly attracted to Wolfgang. It also became clear that Wolfgang returned her feelings, but his personal conflicts prevented him from truly embracing them. \nSupporters of Kala and Wolfgang's relationship are undoubtedly hoping that they will get together. And the teaser image for the Christmas special only serves to excite them. \nSeason 2 will pick up with the eight sensates still grappling to stay alive. The previous season saw them on the run from Terrence Mann's Whispers, who will still be after them come the new season. The sensates will have to set aside their differences and work together, in order to survive and ultimately defeat their enemy. \n\"Sense8\" season 2 will premiere on May 5, 2017.  ",

      "text": "Earlier this year, Netflix expanded its service pretty much everywhere in the world—including regions where people access the internet primarily on mobile phones and on developing, often unreliable cellular and broadband networks.\nAs such, the streaming-video giant needed to find smarter, more efficient ways to deliver high-quality video on mobile without monopolizing subscribers’ data plans or eating up their phone storage.\nThe solution came when Netflix realized that each piece of content needed to be encoded—or compressed into versions that can be played on TVs, desktop, tablets, mobile phones, and other devices—differently to look its best.\nFor example, a fight scene in a darkened hallway on Daredevil is much more complex to encode, and requires more bandwidth to process, than a shot of a clear sky in the same episode. Ranges of light and dark also tend to trip up video codecs, or software that compresses and decompresses digital video. Animation like the Netflix kids show The Deep are normally easier to process than live-action titles. Netflix released a complicated 12-minute film noir earlier this year specifically to allow engineers to experiment with processing different types of video.\nTo account for these visual differences, the Silicon Valley company slices each and every Netflix video into one-to-three minute “chunks” that are analyzed and encoded by a computer separately, it outlined on its tech blog last week. Some pieces of an hour-long episode of Black Mirror , for example, might take up more storage space or require more data to stream than others because they require higher resolutions to look their best.\nNetflix rolled out this feature last week with an update to its mobile app that enabled offline viewing —allowing subscribers to download videos to their devices using this same technology. It also introduced new compression formats and encoding settings to make those downloads more efficient, which it detailed in the blog post.\nThe effort builds on an update that Netflix introduced last year, which customized the encoding settings for each individual title, Variety reported . It reportedly helped save up to 20% of data while delivering better quality.",

      "text": "It has certainly been a great few years to be a comic book fan. Since the 2012 premiere of the CW's Arrow , there has been a massive resurgence of superheroes on television — including three more DC shows on the CW alone. Marvel has joined the fray as well with Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., which is in its fourth season on ABC. Marvel also has a highly acclaimed collection of Netflix dramas including Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Luke Cage and the forthcoming Iron Fist, which just released new official images .\nOf course, those individual series will all be leading up to the Avengers- style team-up The Defenders, which is currently filming .\nCome as you are. #TheDefenders https://t.co/O6qAeXPOP5\nBefore the Defenders can unite, Marvel must introduce the final piece of the puzzle: Danny Rand. Iron Fist will star Game of Thrones ' Finn Jones as the titular character, and Rosario Dawson reprises her role of nurse Claire Temple from the previous three Marvel shows. Another Game of Thrones' alum, Jessica Henwick, will join the series as Colleen Wing, before reprising the role in The Defenders .\nMarvel has redefined action choreography. Marvel's Netflix shows have been lauded for, among other things, tremendous action choreography, most evident in Daredevil 's first two seasons .\nSource: Netflix/YouTube With Iron Fist featuring Rand, a martial arts expert, there will likely be more epic fight scenes to tune into. Marvel showed off some of that action in a teaser trailer for Iron Fist at New York Comic Con a few months ago. Check out the trailer below:\nSource: Netflix US & Canada/YouTube New images give first look at Colleen Wing. As for the new photos, they do not reveal much about the plot of Iron Fist (not surprisingly), but do show Danny teaming with Wing and Temple, as well as give us looks at siblings Joy and Ward Meachum played by Jessica Stroup and Tom Pelphrey, respectively.\nYou can check out all the new images below:\nColleen Wing, Danny Rand and Claire Temple in 'Iron Fist' Source: Cara Howe/Netflix Finn Jones as Danny Rand in 'Iron Fist' Source: JoJo Whilden/Netflix Jessica Henwick as Colleen Wing Source: Patrick Harbron /Netflix Joy and Ward Meachum Source: David Giesbrecht/Netflix Finn Jones as Danny Rand Source: Myles Aronowitz/Netflix Finn Jones as Danny Rand Source: Netflix Netflix is set to release all episodes of Iron Fist 's first season on March 17, 2017. It has not set premiere dates for Marvel's other in-production series, The Punisher and The Defenders .\nMic has ongoing Iron Fist coverage . Please follow our main Iron Fist hub .",

      "text": "Netflix is debuting around 50 original new shows next year but is that good? Rob Moran 7 Dec 2016, 12:44 p.m. The world's biggest streaming service continues its depressing push for quantity over quality. Netflix is debuting around 50 original new shows next year but is that good? Ted Sarandos, Netflix's Chief Content Officer. Photo: Netflix Netflix's surprise breakout, Stranger Things. Photo: Curtis Baker/Netflix Orange Is the New Black, one of Netflix's early favourites. ╳ exit \nIf you thought your Netflix bingeing list was already overflowing to anxiety-inducing levels, just wait till next year. You're probably gonna need one of those toilet-sofas from Idiocracy just to survive. \nThe streaming service, which now has over 87 million subscribers worldwide, will debut around 50 new shows in 2017, including 30 original scripted shows currently in production and 20 unscripted shows yet to be produced, Variety reports . \nThat translates to a library of over 1,000 hours of original programming (more than doubling current figures), as Netflix's Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos boasted at the excitingly titled UBS Global Media & Communications Conference in New York this week. \n1,000 hours of Netflix. My scrolling finger is exhausted just thinking about it. \nI, for one, am all for more TV. If I had a clan, our motto would be, \"More TV. Always.\". But the network's latest focus on quantity over quality marks a disappointing departure from the early model that built its reputation. \nWhen it first launched in Australia in March last year, the 'Netflix Original' label seemed a stamp of approval. Its staple of in-house prestige titles – launched in 2013 with House Of Cards , and continued with Orange Is The New Black , The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , Master Of None , and so on – seemed soundly curated, each commissioned series another totem for TV's so-called Golden Age. \nBut that reputation started to take a dent in 2014 when the streaming service signed Adam Sandler to a head-scratching and widely lampooned four-picture deal (I'm a lifelong Adam Sandler apologist, and even I gave up on The Ridiculous Six ). To be fair, early filler like Hemlock Grove and Marco Polo were always there in the shadows, patiently waiting while viewers exhausted other options. \nBut then we started to get things like The Ranch , which at least had Ashton Kutcher in it, I guess? And if there's one person out there who didn't scroll straight past whatever Netflix Presents: The Characters is, I'd like to meet them. Then I'd just stare at them quizzically for watching something called Netflix Presents: The Characters . You must have so much spare time, person. \nQuickly, the list of glossed over nonsense has piled up. Real Rob , a Curb Your Enthusiasm -y look at the life of Rob Schneider. Who asked for that? You should be ashamed of yourself. The Fundamentals Of Caring , a movie starring Paul Rudd as Selena Gomez's dad (or something). Paul Rudd should never play a dad, unless it's for Clueless 2 . \"Because you watched Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers: Runnin' Down A Dream , you might like True Memoirs Of An International Assassin ,\" a movie starring Kevin James as a killer spy, says Netflix. What? You don't know me at all, Netflix. \nThe streaming giant's latest announcement sparks the same kind of squinty-eyed confusion. \nAccording to Sarandos, Netflix is going big on \"unscripted television\", a suit-and-tie synonym for what's generally been termed \"reality TV\" (or \"trash\", if you're my taxi driver). \nAmong the upcoming debuts is Ultimate Beastmaster , an American Ninja Warrior rip-off, featuring 18 contestants tackling some sorta obstacle course, produced by Sylvester Stallone and The Biggest Loser 's Dave Broome. There goes your Golden Age. \nSure, Netflix's very obvious all-out onslaught has led to some sleeper flukes. Stranger Things , this year's breakout hit, was infamously looked over by 19 other networks before the streaming site picked it up (\"I knew it was something special,\" Sarandos sagely said this week, the kinda line you might hear from a veteran gambler). \nAnd a few 2017 projects talked up by Sarandos this week – Santa Clarita Diet , a real estate comedy starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant; 13 Reasons Why , a YA drama remembering a late teen through her mixtapes, from Spotlight 's Tom McCarthy; Nick Kroll's \"edgy comedy\" Big Mouth ; and Mind Hunter , a cop drama from director David Fincher – at least sound interesting. \nBut while Netflix's splurge to be bigger than their rivals might be beefing up the company, it's not really servicing audiences anymore. All we're left with is less time bingeing and more time filtering through the junk. ",

      "text": "luke cage season netflix marvel More It was basically a foregone conclusion, but Marvel Entertainment and Netflix made it official this week: Luke Cage will be back for a second season.\nOne of the most-watched original series on Netflix, and the recipient of extremely positive reviews from critics and general audiences, Luke Cage debuted September 30 on Netflix and was the third solo series to come out of Marvel’s partnership with the streaming video service. Although the announcement video that confirmed the series’ return didn’t reveal the exact date when star Mike Colter will return as the titular, steel-skinned superhero, it did offer a nice reminder that Pop’s Barber Shop — a central location in the Harlem-based show — is indeed staying open for business.\nMore: Everybody’s always smiling in ‘Luke Cage: Family Matters’ sitcom mashup video\nAlways forward. #LukeCage pic.twitter.com/4pnu52KFKr\n— Luke Cage (@LukeCage) December 4, 2016\nAlong with Colter in the lead role, Luke Cage also starred Simone Missick ( The Road to Sundance ) as Misty Knight, who will return for the upcoming crossover miniseries The Defenders . That series will bring together many of the main characters and supporting cast from Daredevil , Jessica Jones , Luke Cage , and the upcoming Iron Fist series.\nThe first season of Luke Cage also featured Emmy-nominated House of Cards actor Mahershala Ali as the first season’s villain, Frank Whaley ( Pulp Fiction ) as police detective Rafael Scarfe, Theo Rossi ( Sons of Anarchy ) as Shades, and Alfre Woodard ( Cross Creek ) as Mariah Dillard. Rosario Dawson, who appeared in both Daredevil and Jessica Jones , reprised her role as Claire Temple.\nCheo Hodari Coker ( Notorious , NCIS: Los Angeles ) served as the showrunner on the first season of the series and also penned the scripts for the first two episodes, but it’s unknown whether he’ll return for the second season.\nThe next series to debut in the shared universe of Marvel’s Netflix shows will be Iron Fist , which will be available March 17, 2017.\n'Stranger Things' director/producer Shawn Levy enters 'Uncharted' territory Ever wonder about Willy Wonka's origin story?

      "text": "Another film made in the Buffalo area is gaining the national spotlight.\n\"Mercy,\" filmed here by writer and director Chris Sparling, recently debuted on Netflix through its streaming service. It premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival earlier this year and Netflix picked up its distribution rights, showing it under the banner \"A Netflix Original Film.\"\nIn the taut thriller, four estranged stepbrothers return to their secluded home to visit their dying mother. As family secrets are revealed, the farmhouse comes under attack by mysterious masked men.\nThe movie stars James Wolk (\"Zoo\"), Caitlin FitzGerald (\"Masters of Sex\"), Tom Lipinski (\"Suits\"), Dan Ziskie, Michael Godere, Michael Donovan and Constance Barron.\n\"Mercy,\" shot locally in East Aurora and Colden, features some chilling imagery.\n\"Mercy\" used the main farm house at Knox Farm State Park in East Aurora and a church in Colden as the two major locations when it was filmed here in the fall of 2015. Look for some startling and chilling imagery and a twist worthy of the acclaim Sparling previously received for writing the claustrophobic Ryan Reynolds thriller \"Buried.\"",

      "text": "Netflix \nLast Updated: December 7th \nThere are a lot of good TV shows on Netflix (and you can find more with these secret codes ). The bread-and-butter of the Netflix service, however, is its original programming. If you’re trying to figure out exactly which original show to watch next, here’s a great place to start with a look at the 24 best Netflix original series right now. \n24. Flaked (1 season, 8 episodes) AMC \nFlaked is one of the few Netflix originals that never managed to generate any buzz, and it turns out, there was a reason for that: It’s not a very good series. Developed by Will Arnett along with his Arrested Development creator Mitch Hurwitz, Flaked follows Chip, a so-called self-help guru who dispenses advice to friends and neighbors in his Venice neighborhood. Chip, however, has problems of his own (he’s in AA, for instance, but he’s still drinking). Much of the storyline revolves around whether Chip will screw over his best friend and begin dating the woman with whom he is smitten, London (Ruth Kearney). Flaked is aimless, dreary and moves like molasses. There’s a decent cast here (Annabeth Gish, Kirstie Alley, and Heather Graham also show up), and a great deal of talent behind the camera. Unfortunately, little of that talent translates into what’s onscreen.",
