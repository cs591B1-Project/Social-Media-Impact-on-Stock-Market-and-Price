PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 18, 2016 7:18 AM \n[LOS ANGELES] Amazon.com Inc is preparing to take its video streaming service worldwide in a challenge to Netflix Inc, the world's largest online TV network. \nThe world's biggest online retailer, which currently offers its video service in only a handful countries, announced the plans Thursday in a blog post about The Grand Tour , a lavish new reality show featuring the former stars of BBC's popular Top Gear . \n\"In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon,\" the company wrote on its website. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also mentioned the plans on Twitter. \nThe move marks the biggest challenge yet for Netflix, which now operates in about 190 countries completing its international rollout. Amazon, based in Seattle, has spent billions of dollars licensing programming and producing original TV shows and movies as part of its Prime service. \nCustomers who pay U$99 a year for free shipping and other benefits get access to a library of new and older programming at no additional cost. \nSally Fouts, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon's plans earlier Thursday. \nBLOOMBERG ",

(Photo: Amazon) \n(Spoilers ahead; don't read this story if you don't want to know what happened in the first episode of The Grand Tour .) \nThe boys are back and in fine form. \nOn Thursday night, Amazon debuted The Grand Tour , the new show from former Top Gear hosts Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May that’s been in the works for nearly a year and a half. \nGrand Tour dealt with the elephant in the room right off the bat, as radio reports of Clarkson’s March 2015 dismissal from the BBC played over footage of him en route to Heathrow Airport. He caught a flight to LAX, where he pulled out of the rental car garage in a blue Mustang to the strains of I Can See Clearly Now . \nOnce on the highway, Hammond and May pulled up alongside him in red and white Mustangs, bringing a smile to his face — and to millions of fans who’ve been waiting 20 months for this moment. \nAnd it only got better: they rolled on to the California desert, where they staged their own version of Burning Man, complete with a parade featuring dozens of motorized vehicles and a flyover. The opening segment, which spans about five minutes and reportedly cost more than $3 million , was a cross between Mad Max and Top Gear 's 2013 parade that sent $25 million worth of British-made autos down the Mall in London . \nTheir intro included a rundown of every media outlet to ever fire any of them — although the BBC technically never fired Clarkson; it just didn’t renew his contract. “And the good thing is, I’m very unlikely to be fired now, because we’re on the Internet.” (It's also the reason they were able to skirt the non-compete clauses in their BBC contracts that would have kept them off the air until 2017.) \nIn what might have been a jab at Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc, who replaced them on Top Gear (and saw the show's ratings hit a record low ), Clarkson proclaimed the Grand Tour team consists of automotive journalists who have “poured everything we know — everything we care about — into this show.” \nHe introduced the show's traveling studio tent, noting, “We’re going to roam the world. We’re gonna be like gypsies; only the cars we drive will be insured.” ( “Stop saying things that are going to get us fired !” Hammond hissed.) \nOnce inside the fancy new tent, the American studio audience got a PowerPoint lecture on British auto parlance (bonnet vs. hood, lever vs. stick). “Let’s do another, pointing at a photo of a pickup. What type of vehicle is this?” When the audience replied, “truck,” Clarkson said, “No, it’s stupid.” \nIn other words, Grand Tour is vintage Clarkson, right down to his assessment of Hammond’s favorite automaker — Porsche — as boring, even in 887-horsepower 918 Spyder hybrid form, only to change his mind while driving it but pretend he hadn’t for the sake of irritating his co-host. “This,” he told Hammond, “is a missionary position car.” \nIn fact, he argued, the Porsche was Downton Abbey to his hybrid McLaren P1’s Breaking Bad . “That’s crystal meth, this is some iffy weed.” \nJeremy Clarkson with the Porsche 918 Spyder hybrid, or as he called it, \"a mssionary-position car.\" (Photo: Roderick Fountain) \nBut that’s not to say his views haven’t evolved. \nClarkson, who, when gas prices were at their highest in the last decade, once staged a race to see which million-dollar sportscar got the worst fuel economy , emerged from the segment agog at what Porsche and McLaren have done with green technology, making it possible to break 200 miles per hour while emitting less carbon dioxide than a family sedan. These hybrids, he admitted, “take automotive science to a new level” and “make the traditional supercar look wooden and old-fashioned.” \nThere are other changes from Top Gear and not all of them work: In the premiere, they replaced the Stig with ex-NASCAR driver Mike Skinner . After 13 years of watching a masked, silent \"tame racing driver\" who only communicated using his musical choices and body language, it was genuinely unsettling to actually see the driver's face and hear him giving NASCAR-style commentary on a show that has always openly mocked stock-car racing. Somehow, bringing in Belgian F1 driver Jérôme d'Ambrosio made more sense, even though he spoke French the entire time. \nAlso, the Lotus-designed test track at Dunsfold in Surrey, England, has been supplanted by the “Eboladrome,” a track that’s shaped like the deadly virus and has about the same odds of survival. Oh, and the boys tried a new celebrity segment but gave up after their first attempt killed Jeremy Renner and their second took out Armie Hammer. \nThere are talent bookers listed in the credits, so there will probably be some kind of celebrity interview segment going forward. However, we wouldn't miss it if they dropped it altogether. After being apart from Clarkson, Hammond and May for so long, we're perfectly content to let the cars — and the hosts — be the stars. \n(New episodes of The Grand Tour are available free to Amazon Prime subscribers every Friday for the next 11 weeks, with each filmed in a different part of the world. Next week, the show travels to Johannesburg, South Africa.) 3 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

      "text": "The Grand Tour Debuts Today! F*@# YES!   \nToday’s the day. The Grand Tour hits Amazon Prime today. Seriously. We’re less than 12 hours from seeing Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May again grace our screens. Sure, we’ve all made a big deal about it coming on November 18th, though, as Jalopnik pointed out, no one from Amazon said precisely what time on November 18th . Yesterday, The Grand Tour Twitter account confirmed that it would launch at 00:01 GMT . \nAllow us to spare you from Googling things like “What does GMT mean?” and “Difference between my time zone and GMT,” and all the ensuing maths. The Grand Tour will arrive on 7:01 PM EST tonight. Which means, if you hurry, you can make it to the West Coast and watch it three hours before the rest of the nation! Go on. Leave right now. The bragging rights will be well worth it. \nCan’t wait until later? You can pass some of the time by watching this ungodly awkward interview from the BBC’s The One Show, in which James May and Richard Hammond appear to promote their Amazon series. It takes all of 48 seconds for it to become glaringly obvious just how much the BBC hates the The Grand Tour . For their entrance, the dull chat show forced the duo to enter inside a shambles of a cardboard car. \nFor their part, Hammond and May are largely gracious, though they manage to slip in a fair amount of slights to their former network. The best? That they refuse to ever admit they had a show before. Take this exemplary quote from Hammond: “The show that we never did, but if we had done, would’ve had global appeal...” \nEnjoy.",

      "text": "Amazon has already stoked the holiday consumption fire by rolling out a bunch of deals well ahead of Black Friday , but this weekend’s shopping opportunity comes with a giant catch: starting November 18 and running through the 21st, certain deals are only available if you order through Alexa, the voice-controlled virtual assistant that runs on Amazon’s Echo speakers and Fire TV products.\nOver the next few days, if you ask Alexa \"Alexa, what are your deals?\" you’ll be able to order a variety of different products at a discount, including a Philips Hue LED lightbulb starter kit ($15 off), a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 bot ($40 off), a 10-piece All-Clad stainless steel cookware set ($130 off), a $60 discount on a TCL smart TV, and $50 off Amazon’s own Tap Bluetooth speaker. Amazon says that other deals, not yet announced, will be available throughout the rest of November and December.\nA testment to Amazon's vision for voice shopping Not listed in Alexa-only deals so far: guides to getting along with family this Thanksgiving, toolkits to dismantle the simulation we’re currently living in, cases of Amazon wine. However, the holiday season is long, and it is still early!\nAlexa users have been able to order and re-order Amazon items by voice since the earliest days of the Echo speaker, and customers in certain markets have been able to make two-hour Prime Now requests through Alexa since July. But this weekend’s voice-shopping exclusive marks the first time that Amazon has granted Prime customers and Alexa users access to discounts that aren’t available through Amazon’s website or mobile app. It’s a testament to Amazon’s vision of Alexa as a legitimate shopping platform, and is also meant to incentivize Alexa users to at least try shopping through voice command.",

      "text": "Amazon Graphic First there was Black Friday, then Cyber Monday. Now it’s “Voice Shopping Weekend.” \nAmazon has come up with a new holiday shopping event, aiming to get more people accustomed to buying things with their voice using the company’s Alexa virtual assistant. Voice Shopping Weekend, which starts tonight and runs through Nov. 21, offers exclusive deals to Amazon Prime members who use their voices to order designated items on Amazon’s Echo, Echo Dot and Tap smart speakers, Fire HD tablet and Fire TV.\nUsers will be able to ask, “Alexa, what are your deals?” to have Alexa read a list out loud, or they can check the Alexa Deals website . Amazon says special prices on specific items will be available “at select times between November 18 and November 21 while supplies last.”\nThe company says it will also offer Alexa-exclusive deals “on Black Friday , Cyber Monday , and every day in November and December.” So it isn’t so much Voice Shopping Weekend as it is “Voice Shopping Season,” apparently\nThe list of voice-exclusive deals includes classic doorbusters like TVs, headphones and cookware sets, in addition to high-tech toys. Here’s an initial list of deals as provided by the company, along with the associated voice commands.\nSave $50 on an Amazon Tap – say, “Alexa, order an Amazon Tap” Save $80 on a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV – say, “Alexa, order a Samsung TV” Save $30 on a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 App controlled robot – say, “Alexa, order a Star Wars robot” Save $15 on a Philips Hue LED Starter Kit with 2 Bulbs & Hue Bridge Hub – works with Amazon Alexa – say, “Alexa, order a Hue Starter Kit” Save $80 on Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones – say, “Alexa, order studio headphones” Save $130 on a 10-piece All-Clad stainless steel cookware set – say, “Alexa, order an All-Clad cookware set” Save $10 on LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box – say, “Alexa, order a Lego Classic Brick Box.” Save 30% on a 48-pack of Amazon Basics AA batteries – say, “Alexa, order AA batteries” Save 35% on Lindt Lindor Milk Chocolate Truffles – say, “Alexa, order Lindor truffles” Amazon has been called the “accidental” early winner in the voice-controlled home, leading Google, Apple and others with surprisingly strong sales of Echo and other Alexa-enabled devices. In addition to the native functionality of Alexa, third-party developers have built more than 2,000 Alexa “skills,” extending the voice-enabled assistant’s capabilities for everything from checking the ferry schedule to tracking a phone or calling for a ride.\nThe bigger push into voice shopping takes Alexa back to Amazon’s e-commerce roots. Separate from the special deals, the company says tens of millions of items are available to be ordered by voice on Alexa. In addition to being Prime members, users need to have one-click shopping enabled to buy items via voice.",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 | 09:03PM PT \nGlobal E-commerce giant Amazon has given a stealth launch to Amazon Prime Video in Australia . \nThat means that “ The Grand Tour ,” the new motoring-lifestyle series will be immediately – and legally – available to viewers in Australia. Jeremy Clarkson and his “Top Gear” team are popular enough to perform live events Down Under. \nAmazon announced earlier this week that “The Grand Tour” would soon be available in 200 territories. \nThe soft launch was uncovered by tech sites EFTM and Gizmodo Australia, which discovered that Amazon Prime was no longer blocking connections from Australian IP addresses and that it is accepting Australian credit cards. Would-be subscribers can access either the U.S. or U.K. sites. The site shows pricing (in U.S. dollars) at $10.99 per month. \nA more official debut is expected in the next month or two. Amazon has not yet launched its Amazon Prime shopping subscription service, but it is understood to be studying delivery options in the continent-sized nation. \nThe launch will add to the competition in Australia’s streaming video market. The sector has quickly become dominated by Netflix and has already seen the closure of local player Quickflix and the announced January closure of the Foxtel-owned Presto. \nIt seems that some of Amazon’s own shows including “Transparent” and “Mozart in the Jungle” may not be available as they are licensed to pay-TV leader Foxtel or to local streaming firm Stan. They remain geo-blocked for Australians not using a VPN. Similar availability problems occurred during Netflix’s early days in Australian, but Netflix is now believed to have over 1 million subscribers in the market less than two years after launch.

      "text": "Amazon is giving out discounts if you order through Alexa this weekend \"Alexa, give me one good reason to shop by voice.\" share If you want an idea of how seriously Amazon is pursuing the idea of shopping by voice , look no further than the way the executive who runs the initiative describes it on his LinkedIn page : “Amazon 2.0.” But customers are going to need an incentive to try out this new ordering method. So starting Friday, Amazon is offering a host of deals exclusive to customers who place an order through the Alexa voice service that powers the Amazon Echo and other Amazon voice-enabled devices. Amazon first launched voice shopping with a simple use case: Reordering an item you’ve previously bought. Since then, the company has expanded voice shopping to tens of millions of Prime-eligible items. Amazon envisions a future where its customers can easily place orders on the go via voice, even while driving . Such an evolution of e-commerce could grow into yet another competitive advantage for Amazon. Customers who want to order an item by voice say, “Alexa, order a [product name].” Amazon then selects a “well-priced product” that is eligible for Prime shipping. The company doesn’t disclose all the factors used to choose the specific item, which is made available through a program called “Amazon’s Choice.” The promotion will run through the end of the day Monday, Nov. 21, and feature deals such as a 32-inch Samsung TV for $119 and an Amazon Tap, a sort of portable Echo, for $50 off. recode_divider",

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. \nEnlarge Image They're friends. How about that?\nPhoto by Amazon/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Donald Trump doesn't seem enamored of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\nEarlier this year, he threatened that, should he become president, Amazon will face \" such problems .\" He believes, you see, that Bezos bought the Washington Post in order to get political influence for his company.\nOddly, now that Trump is president-elect, Amazon has released an ad that features something that many believe Trump would like to control or even exile: a Muslim.\nHere we see a Christian priest and a Muslim imam. They meet for tea. They're friends, you see. They hug each other. \nBut they're not getting any younger. So they end up buying each other a gift with their Amazon Prime app to help them with their advancing years. It happens to be the same gift. I won't spoil it all for you.\nIn an atmosphere as divisive as the current one, this ad manages to offer a picture of rare advancement. \nTrump has been adamant in calling for a ban on Muslims traveling to the US . Currently, there's talk of a Muslim registry . \nIn this light, it's impossible not to see the political overtones in this ad. \nMore Technically Incorrect Trump's chief strategist thinks too many tech CEOs are Asian? Tom Brady brilliantly deflates NFL in new ad Apple says the MacBook Pro is at the pinnacle of great ideas Moreover, Bezos himself took to Twitter to laud it. He offered : \"Love this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team.\"\nThe fractious nature of so much not just in America, but in the world, makes it hard to be anything but hard-nosed.\nThis ad is, after all, attempting to manipulate your emotions to give Bezos and his company money. \nBut as we lurch toward the holidays, a time when we're supposed to at least try to appreciate each other, you'd hope that one or two people would stop to consider that there's more to life than war, power and domination.\nThis Amazon ad ends with both holy men on their knees praying. That's a symbol for us all.",

      "title": "Amazon video going global in Netflix challenge",
      "text": "More Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix (Xetra: 552484 - news ) on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported. Amazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. Prime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report. This would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. When contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled \"The Grand Tour\" and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December. \"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said. The worldwide, exclusive availability of \"The Grand Tour\" and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix. How the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. If Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors. - Eyes on Netflix (Swiss: NFLX-USD.SW - news ) - Netflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth. The company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. Of that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service. For the current quarter Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. The service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers. The earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. The on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange (LSE: 0OQV.L - news ) is the New Black.\" - Offering originals - Netflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. Online platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit (Stuttgart: A1139A - news ) . Prime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store. Like Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers. Original Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US. Amazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier. Reblog",

      "text": "Amazon.com, Inc. ’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) Amazon Web Services (AWS) has made AWS Marketplace a one-stop solution for customers who subscribe to third party Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Application Programming Interface (API) products through AWS.\nThe company announced yesterday that it has enabled subscription to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) applications directly through AWS Marketplace.\nWhat Does it Mean \nPreviously, independent software vendors (ISVs) offering SaaS application to AWS customers were required to have their own metering and billing system or avail a third party billing system.\nNow AWS has developed a unified metering and billing system that will make things easy and hassle-free for customers and vendors. Vendors can put their charges in a customer’s existing AWS bill, thereby saving costs and accelerating the sales cycle.\nCustomers on the other hand get a streamlined payment system. They will have to pay a single monthly bill that includes SaaS usage charges and charges for other AWS products and services. This eliminates the need to maintain accounts with each ISV from which they source products.\nAt launch, AWS has 24 products from 21 sellers - Aspera, Avalara, Alert Logic, Bitium, Cloudyn, Cloudinary, Dome9, Druva, Datadog, Datapath.io, HERE, Pitney Bowes, Qubole, NetApp, New Relic, Solodev, Sumo Logic, Trend Micro, Dynatracea and Signiant, Solano, and expects further additions in the coming months.\nThe company stated that following the launch, vendors and customers will have greater access to each other with more products available in its marketplace.\nAMAZON.COM INC Price \n\nAMAZON.COM INC Price | AMAZON.COM INC Quote \nAWS Holds the Key \nWe see the move as Amazon’s latest gambit to increase its market share in the lucrative cloud computing business. It intends to give both sellers and customers a solid reason to opt for AWS.  \nAmazon Web Services is the cash cow for Amazon. The business contributed $3.2 billion in the third quarter. It generates much higher margins than retail and therefore has a positive impact on Amazon’s profitability. We remain optimistic about the functionality, partner ecosystem and the experience AWS offers and believe this will lead to continued customer wins.\nAmazon remains the cloud infrastructure leader, well ahead of Microsoft and Alphabet.\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider \nCurrently, Amazon is a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) stock. Better-ranked stocks in the in the broader technology sector include NVIDIA Corporation ( NVDA - Free Report ) , Kimball Electronics, Inc. ( KE - Free Report ) and Control4 Corporation ( CTRL - Free Report ) , each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here . \nFor the current year, the consensus estimate for NVIDIA has gone up by 30.6% in the past 30 days. Estimates for Kimball Electronics and Control4 have gone up by 8.1% and 10%, respectivelyover the same time frame. \nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

How about that?\nPhoto by Amazon/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET Donald Trump doesn't seem enamored of Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos.\nEarlier this year, he threatened that, should he become president, Amazon will face \" such problems .\" He believes, you see, that Bezos bought the Washington Post in order to get political influence for his company.\nOddly, now that Trump is president-elect, Amazon has released an ad that features something that many believe Trump would like to control or even exile: a Muslim.\nHere we see a Christian priest and a Muslim imam. They meet for tea. They're friends, you see. They hug each other.\nBut they're not getting any younger. So they end up buying each other a gift with their Amazon Prime app to help them with their advancing years. It happens to be the same gift. I won't spoil it all for you.\nIn an atmosphere as divisive as the current one, this ad manages to offer a picture of rare advancement.\nTrump has been adamant in calling for a ban on Muslims traveling to the US . Currently, there's talk of a Muslim registry .\nIn this light, it's impossible not to see the political overtones in this ad.\nMore Technically Incorrect Trump's chief strategist thinks too many tech CEOs are Asian? Tom Brady brilliantly deflates NFL in new ad Apple says the MacBook Pro is at the pinnacle of great ideas Moreover, Bezos himself took to Twitter to laud it. He offered : \"Love this TV commercial for Amazon Prime. Very proud of our ad team.\"\nThe fractious nature of so much not just in America, but in the world, makes it hard to be anything but hard-nosed.\nThis ad is, after all, attempting to manipulate your emotions to give Bezos and his company money.\nBut as we lurch toward the holidays, a time when we're supposed to at least try to appreciate each other, you'd hope that one or two people would stop to consider that there's more to life than war, power and domination.\nThis Amazon ad ends with both holy men on their knees praying. That's a symbol for us all.",

      "text": " 04   Kogan welcomes prospect of Amazon AAP – 44 minutes ago View Photo \n\nRuslan Kogan has dismissed concerns that the arrival in Australia of Amazon will hurt his own, eponymous business, saying he expects Kogan.com will benefit from the presence of the online sales behemoth. \nAmazon has been rumoured to be planning an Australian launch as early as next year, with analysts warning many retailers, in particular JB Hi-Fi, Harvey Norman and Kogan.com, will come under pressure. \n\"Amazon will hurt some retailers no doubt but the ones they'll hurt are the ones that are selling the same thing as everybody else at fat margins,\" Mr Kogan told AAP. \nHe said Kogan.com has a large and growing number of higher-margin private label products, including Kogan electrical products and Ovela homewares. \nPrivate labels accounted for 37 per cent of the group's gross sales during the 2016 financial year. \nMr Kogan said Amazon would lift the profile of online retail - a sector that currently makes up only six per cent of the total market - and encourage brands to sell online. \n\"One of the challenges has been convincing brands to take on the online retail channel seriously and they are all fearful of the incumbent retailers and don't want to upset them,\" he said. \n\"Someone like Amazon would help that conversation significantly. \n\"Amazon is a marketplace and they would be used in an identical manner in how we use eBay currently.\" \nForager Funds senior equities analyst Daniel Mueller said Australia's online retail sales lagged far behind other developed countries. \n\"If Amazon were to come to Australia it would lead to a greater take up of online retail and Kogan would be a beneficiary of that,\" he said. \n\"The flip side is that Amazon tends to dominate markets where it operates and it could take market share from Kogan.\" \nMr Kogan talked up the potential benefits of Amazon's arrival during Kogan's first annual general meeting since it listed on the ASX in July. \nDuring the meeting, held in Melbourne on Friday , Mr Kogan said sales have exceeded expectations and Kogan's board now expects underlying earnings to beat its prospectus forecast of $6.9 million. \nGuidance has been upgraded to $8 million to $9 million in the 2016/17 year, with shares rallying on the news. \nCiti analysts said in an August report that JB Hi-Fi and Harvey Norman would face a loss of sales and risk to overall gross margins in competition with Amazon. \nCiti estimated Amazon could reach $3.5 to $4 billion in sales in Australia within five years - assuming it launches Down Under within two years. \nKogan shares closed up three cents, or 2.1 per cent, at $1.48, though the stock remains below its $1.80 issue price.

      "text": "The much awaited new car show, The Grand Tour , launches on Amazon Prime today, Friday November 18.\nThe show is hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond, all former presenters of the BBC’s popular Top Gear series. All three signed a three series deal with Amazon.\nEach series will include 12 hour-long episodes. But unlike many video-on-demand (VoD) series which release all episodes simultaneously, The Grand Tour will have weekly episodes, more like traditional television.\nThe Grand Tour Offical Trailer. Due to the nature of the program and the hosts’ association with Top Gear, there have been intellectual property fears about its resemblance to the BBC program and its format. At its height, Top Gear was reported to be worth £50 million (A$83 million) a year for the BBC.\nClarkson said :\nThe lawyers pointed out that we couldn’t host the show from a static location because, although it had [originally] been our idea, the BBC owned it.\nSo to alleviate this issue at least, the team will travel the world and host each episode from a giant tent .\nThe Grand Tour in grand tent in California. Amazon Studios The program is reported to have a budget of £4.5 million (A$7.4 million) per episode, ten times the budget allocated when the trio were hosting Top Gear.\nThe opening title sequence for The Grand Tour itself is said to have cost £2.5 million (A$4.1 million) alone, set to show homage to Mad Max: Fury Road .\nThe Grand Tour in Namibia. Amazon Studios So it’s a big show with big expectations, from both fans and Amazon Prime.\nAt the moment Amazon Prime is only available in US, UK, Germany and Japan but Amazon has just announced the show will be available in more than 200 countries from December.\nWhat is that accent for Holden Man 3,000? So what impact could The Grand Tour – and the potential of a wider Amazon Prime launch – have on Australia’s changing media landscape and Australians’ viewing behaviours?\nA flagship launch program There had been some speculation that The Grand Tour would be the flagship program used to launch the Amazon Prime service in Australia.\nNetflix has seen great success after its global launch . In Australia, Netflix is the major VoD service, far outweighing the subscription numbers of local services.\nThe success of Netflix has also seen a shake-up of the local media landscape.\nQuickflix’s future is unclear despite a recent takeover , Presto will cease its service in January 2017 and Foxtel is reshaping its packages and pricing as it attempts to re-imagine itself in this ever changing space.\nWith Amazon Prime now launching in Australia there will be two international VoD services competing with a single locally owned VoD service, Stan.\nThere is also Hulu, another VoD and streaming service, which may too set its sights on Australia in the near future. This is more likely to have the largest impact on Foxtel due to its recent deal to stream several sport channels.\nSo The Grand Tour will be available to Australian consumers, but only after the launch date and on a subscription service, no free to air access.\nWill some Australians seek alternative ways to gain access, as we saw occur with Orange is the New Black and House of Cards prior to Netflix’s local launch? Australian consumers have shown they will find a way to access the content as they did with Game of Thrones, available here only on Foxtel.\nWill the recent apparent decline in copyright infringement begin to increase again, thanks to The Grand Tour?\nFans will want to see what antics the presenters get up to on The Grand Tour. Amazon Studios Australian and illegal downloads Australia has a reputation as a world leader in piracy of movies , music and television programs .\nBut research shows that one of the major reasons Australians seek out illicit downloads in such numbers is that it is more difficult to access very popular content legitimately in Australia.\nCompared to consumers in the United States and the European Union, Australians pay more for digital goods , have less choice in distribution channels, are exposed to substantial delays in access, and are sometimes denied access completely.\nWhen quizzed about their downloading habits, it became clear quite quickly that Australian consumers often feel morally justified in downloading content illicitly if it is not available through legal channels.\nThese are not the hardcore pirates who never pay for content. They are ordinary consumers who believe that paying for content is the right thing to do, but only if they are treated fairly in return.\nIt is sometimes easy for Australians to feel hard done by in digital media markets. Change has been slow in Australia, and consumers blame distributors here for not keeping up with changing demand for more convenient digital distribution channels.\nA large part of the problem is that media markets are segmented geographically, but demand for hit television programs, movies and music is global. Massive advertising campaigns whip up demand for new releases around the world, and fans want to be part of the global conversations around new releases.\nInternational media markets are a complex business. For a premium distributor looking to keep consumers locked into expensive monthly cable plans, or a new entrant trying to build a user base, it makes financial sense to lock up content with exclusive deals.\nBut when consumers are told they must wait for access, many will turn to illicit downloading rather than take what they see as a bad deal that is forced upon them.\nWill we need multiple subscriptions? The major changes in digital media markets over the last few years means consumers are getting better opportunities, but Australian VoD services are struggling to compete.\nIncreased competition usually means better outcomes for consumers in the long run. In the short term, though, the fragmentation we are seeing in distribution channels could lead to more exclusive releases and shrinking catalogues as subscription services try to conquer the market for viewers.\nAs more streaming services begin to compete with each other they look for ways in which to gain subscribers. Netflix has used its Netflix originals to lure subscribers and is set to invest US$6 billion ($A7.78 billion) in 2017 on original content.\nBut if there are a number of VoD services all producing their own exclusive original content, where does this leave the consumers? Is the future one where consumers must subscribe to multiple VoD services, or somehow try to jump between them?\nThe Digital Media Research Centre is tracking outcomes for consumers in these rapidly changing industries.\nIn the meantime, consumers will continue to revolt. There is a good chance that exclusive deals may drive more consumers to infringe copyright, and that would see The Grand Tour as their next target for illegal downloading.\nUltimately, until VoD services work out a way to get consumers access to the media they want, everyone will keep losing out.\nJeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May on the The Grand Tour in Johannesburg.

      "text": "Amazon video going global in Netflix challenge – report The online retail giant's video-on-demand service will likely expand to 200 countries and territories Published 1:50 PM, November 18, 2016 Updated 1:58 PM, November 18, 2016 GOING GLOBAL. The retail giant expands its video service for a global audience, battling it out with Netflix. Image from Amazon. \nSAN FRANCISCO, U.S. – Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported on Thursday, Nov 17 . \nAmazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India. \nPrime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report. \nThis would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service. \nWhen contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled The Grand Tour and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December. (Read: Ex-'Top Gear' hosts currently a voice option on Waze ) \n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said. \nThe worldwide, exclusive availability of The Grand Tour and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix. \nHow the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service. \nIf Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors. \nEyes on Netflix \nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth. \nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter – most of them from outside the United States – and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers. \nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service. \nFor the current quarter, Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US. \nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including Stranger Things and Narcos , with helping draw customers. \nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street. \nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including House of Cards and Orange is the New Black . \nOffering originals \nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion. \nOnline platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion – more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit. \nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store. \nLike Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers. \nOriginal Amazon productions Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US. \nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38% from a year earlier. – Rappler.com HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

      "text": "$29 for This Premium 4-Course Training on Amazon Web Services- Deal Alert \nYou might think Amazon Web Services would have chilled out in the month before its big Re:Invent conference. After all, that show, which takes place at the end of November, is when the cloud provider typically shows off a bonanza of new products and features. \nBut Christmas has come early in October, at least for people who are looking to run hybrid cloud deployments with AWS. Here's the rundown of important news you may have missed. VMware and Amazon team up \nThe big bombshell for the month was a partnership between AWS and VMware . The latter company is going to launch a managed service that will make it easy for people to migrate workloads from on-premises hardware to the public cloud and back again, using VMware's vSphere management software. [ Best Bluetooth speakers: We'll help you find the best wireless speakers for pairing with your smartphone or tablet—whatever your budget, and whatever music floats your boat. ] \nIt's a move that will make it easier for businesses to try out hybrid cloud configurations with a single control plane that administrators are already familiar with from managing their current infrastructure. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy looked like a cat who had just swallowed a canary sitting on stage next to Vmware CEO Pat Gelsinger during a San Francisco press event to announce the partnership. But both men seemed like they got something important out of the deal. Amazon gets a hybrid cloud strategy, while VMware gets a way to easily integrate its products with a leading cloud provider — and probably make a whole bunch of money in the process. \nRight now, it's in closed beta, expected to launch next year. A new service helps move workloads to the cloud \nBut what if you don't want to use VMware's managed service? Well, AWS has a Server Migration Service that's supposed to help lift and shift workloads. To use it, administrators install a connector that will analyze their virtualized server environment and collect information about the instances they’re using. \nAfter that, they can use the AWS Management Console to replicate those instances up to the cloud as Amazon Machine Images stored in the AWS Elastic Block Store service. After that, admins can spin up what should be a replica of the same instance running on-premises in AWS. The x1.16xlarge arrives for big, but not huge workloads \nSometimes, you just need a stupendously massive hunk of compute power. That's what the x1.32xlarge instance offers -- 128 virtual CPU cores, 1952GiB of RAM and 2 1920GB SSDs. (1 GiB is roughly equivalent to 1.074GB.) \nIt's among the most expensive compute instances Amazon offers and has been useful for customers looking to run applications like SAP HANA. \nBut what about customers who want half the power? Amazon's swooping in with the appropriately named x1.16xlarge , which sports (you guessed it) 64 vCPU cores, 976GiB of RAM, and one 1920GB SSD. It's priced at half the cost of its larger sibling. \nBoth of those instance types are also now available in Amazon's Mumbai, Seoul and US GovCloud regions, in addition to the seven other regions worldwide that also run x1 instances. AWS opens for business in Ohio \nGeographic expansion is the name of the game for cloud providers, and AWS pushed its datacenter footprint forward with the launch of a new US-East region based in Ohio . It's part of a one-two punch of cloud regions available in the eastern part of America, alongside Amazon's longstanding US-East region based in Virginia. \nAt launch, the region supports a wide variety of AWS services, including EC2, Elastic Block Store, Aurora, DynamoDB, Snowball, Kinesis and Lambda. Netflix's former architect goes to work at its preferred cloud provider \nAdrian Cockroft made a name for himself as a Cloud Architect at Netflix and then as a Technical Fellow at Battery Ventures. The soft-spoken Brit was a fixture at cloud conferences, and he's now been pulled into Amazon's orbit as its VP of Cloud Infrastructure. \nAWS CTO Werner Vogels said in a blog post that Cockroft will be working with product teams, consulting with customers about their cloud architecture, and helping out open-source communities.

      "title": "Amazon Prime Membership Sale: One Day Only $79 Discount Deal Announced Just In Time For Black Friday 2016",
      "text": "Amazon has announced a pre-Black Friday sale on memberships in its Amazon Prime two-day free shipping service. The annual price to join Prime will drop from $99 to $79 for one day only. ( Amazon ) Advertisement \nRight on the heels of Black Friday, Amazon has announced that it will be offering customers a special discount on membership in its Amazon Prime service, cutting the price to $79 per year from the regular $99 fee it usually charges for an annual membership. The one-day-only sale will run on Friday, Nov. 18 from 12 a.m. ET and conclude at 11:59 p.m. PT. Black Friday Almost Here \nThe holiday shopping season is about to kick into full gear, and most of the nation's top retailers such as Costco , Best Buy and Walmart have already announced their Black Friday deals on some of the hottest items in technology and other categories. We're even seeing leaks of Cyber Monday deals from some outlets. \nAmazon has already been rolling out pre-Black Friday deals in what it calls its \"countdown to Black Friday.\" Many of the online giant's actual Black Friday deals, however, have yet to be announced, with the few exceptions being planned discounts on branded items such as the Echo personal assistant and various Fire TV streaming products. Amazon Prime Membership Discount \nIn anticipation of the holiday season, Amazon has announced a one-day discount on its most popular in house \"item,\" that is, a membership to its Amazon Prime service. At last count in January 2016, no less than 54 million Americans held Prime memberships, accounting for almost half of U.S. households. The most popular perk of the membership is, of course, the free two-day shipping and discounted one-day shipping on hundreds of thousands of Prime eligible items. \nThe holiday shopping season is the most popular time to join Prime, and for one day only, this Friday, Nov. 18, Amazon has announced that it will cut the price of an annual Prime membership by 20 percent, from the usual $99 per year fee to $79 annually for the first year of membership. When Amazon first launched Prime, the service cost $79, but the price was raised to $99 per year in 2014. New Amazon Prime Video Programming \nAt that time, Amazon explained the price hike would be offset by the additional services available to Prime members, and in that regard, the company has been beefing up its Amazon Prime Video streaming offerings with numerous original programming choices. Amazon is using the membership sale to promote one of those shows, a new motoring travel series known as The Grand Tour , hosted by Jeremy Clarkson, Richard Hammond and James May, formerly of BBC program Top Gear . \n\"Amazon is committed to bringing Prime members programming that is unique and exciting,\" said Conrad Riggs, Head of Unscripted, Amazon Originals. \"We are thrilled to bring back together the world's beloved hosting team of Clarkson, Hammond and May for extraordinary adventures that can only be seen on Amazon Prime Video.\" TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "This new eBook , published on Amazon received International Best Seller Status through a promotional campaign led by the KIDD Marketing group on October 26th, that included reaching number two in Asian History. Other categories in the top 100 included: Politics and Science, Eastern Philosophy, History, Eastern Religions and Sacred Texts, Political Philosophy and more. The book in its print and eBook editions explores her struggle with Traumatic Brain Injury, (TBI), discrimination and life struggles as a Japanese American after World War II. \"There's a Japanese proverb that says: Fall seven times and stand up eight. As long as you're breathing, there is a chance to always overcome your situation. Never give up. Always try your hardest, even if it seems like you're hanging on by a thread. There's that thread that will keep you going. It’s about a person's inner core. The principles we live by determine who we are and our future as parents, leaders, and every day people. I always say be kind. It will change the world,” says Whaley .\nWho were the samurai and how could a people dedicated to war and violence have such an impact on a culture known for its politeness, manners and aesthetic beauty? The ancient samurai (even today) lived by a moral and ethical code known as bushido, or ‘the way of the warrior. Bushido comprises the following principles: courage, integrity, benevolence, respect, honesty, honor, and loyalty. “The Courage of a Samurai” presents these principles through the lives of individuals who show us what we can do today to be leaders, to create world change.\n“Bushido, samurai code of ethics, prepares each of us to see what is important in life. It is truly the foundation for being a great human being,” said Patsy Surh O’Connell, Founder and President of the Asia Pacific Cultural Center in the Seattle area.\nAbout the author\nLori Tsugawa Whaley is an author , inspirational speaker, and a descendant of the samurai warrior. A Pacific Northwest native, she graduated with Honors from Portland State University in 1978. Lori is a member of Association of Women Owned Business (AWOB), the Japanese American Citizen League (JACL), U.S.-Japan Council (USJC), Japanese Cultural & Community Center of Washington (JCCCW), the Japan-America Society of the State of Washington (JASSW), and the Camp Harmony Committee. Lori performs Japanese folk tales and dramas that involve using puppets for both young and old audiences, to demonstrate the principles of the bushido. She and her husband John (for nearly 40 years) call the Pacific Northwest home. They are the proud parents of two sons and five grandchildren. Please visit loriwhaley dot com to learn more.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Uses Voice Assistant Alexa To Tease More Holiday Deals \nAmazon will offer exclusive shopping deals during the holiday shopping season for users of its voice assistant Alexa. \nStarting today through Nov. 21, shoppers will get exclusive deals on TVs, cooking sets, Legos, and more for orders placed through Alexa and its companion home automation devices, Echo and Dot. Users will be able to access those deals by saying, “Alexa, what are your deals?” \nIt’s not surprising that Alexa is playing a role in this year’s holiday e-commerce blitz considering Amazon’s effort to market its home automation devices. Alexa has gained traction with users for its ability to answer questions, turn on lights, and re-order items like diapers directly through the e-commerce giant’s voice-controlled home devices as well as through its connected speaker, Tap and Fire TV. \nAmazon said that it will debut Alexa-exclusive deals on the busy shopping day after Thanksgiving—Black Friday—along with the what’s known as Cyber Monday—and every day in November and December. Customers who buy discounted items costing $10 or more through Alexa between now and Cyber Monday will also receive a bonus $5 Amazon gift card. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe one caveat is that items purchased must be a Prime product, meaning it is fulfilled by Amazon and can be shipped to customer’s doorsteps within two days or less. Alexa automatically charges users’ credit cards, and arranges the shipping. \nAmazon’s Alexa deals help to put the spotlight on voice-enabled assistants, a growing battleground that includes a number of players such as Google and Apple . Of course, Amazon’s exclusive deals for Alexa users is yet another way for it to encourage shoppers to buy more items during a quarter that is the biggest of the year in terms of revenue for the company. The idea is to make commerce so easy for customers that they barely think about it—and, of course, help increase Amazon’s business. \nAmazon offered similar exclusive deals for Alexa shopping on its Prime Day, a self-declared e-commerce holiday in July.",

      "title": "Wal-Mart could give Amazon a run for its money this holiday season - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is reaping the rewards of its digital investments, which could position it as a force to be reckoned with in the online battle against the rest of the retail competition.\n“For holiday and fourth quarter, we expect Walmart to continue to excel on multiple fronts, particularly online where we expect sales to continue to accelerate on a percentage basis, with a growth rate approaching 30% likely as it leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy online/pick-up in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com,” said Charlie O’Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody’s.\nWal-Mart WMT, -3.08% reported a 20.6% increase in global e-commerce sales on a constant-currency basis for the third quarter. Moody’s puts Wal-Mart’s online sales growth on a base of $14 billion to $15 billion, without a full quarter of Jet.com results.\nTotal revenue for the third quarter was $118.2 billion, up from $117.4 billion last year, but falling short of the FactSet consensus of $118.6 billion. Earnings per share were 98 cents, down from $1.03 last year, but ahead of the 96-cent FactSet estimate.\nWal-Mart shares are down 4.4% in Thursday trading. \nSee also: Wal-Mart sales fall short as profit declines 8.2% \nWal-Mart added eight million SKUs (stock keeping units) to the website over the past three months, Chief Executive Doug McMillion said Thursday in his prepared remarks. And e-commerce added 50 basis points to the retailer’s third-quarter U.S. same-store sales figure, “which is our largest contribution yet,” he added.\nWalmart U.S. same-store sales increased 1.2% in the third quarter, driven by a 0.7% traffic increase, Wal-Mart said.\nWal-Mart announced a strategic alliance with Chinese e-commerce company JD.com this summer, that included the sale of its Yihaodian website to JD.com. \nSee also: Wal-Mart’s deal with China’s JD.com may be copied by others \nThe partners announced that they were launching three new initiatives in late October. \nWal-Mart has also invested in New Dada, a Chinese on-demand logistics and grocery e-commerce platform, McMillon said in his remarks. New Dada is making two-hour delivery service from 45 Walmart locations possible. \nSee also: Amazon’s big rival in e-commerce is Wal-Mart \nWal-Mart announced that it was acquiring Jet.com for $3 billion in August. Jet.com founder Marc Lore took over Wal-Mart’s e-commerce operations earlier this month . \nNeil Saunders, chief executive of retail research agency and consulting firm Conlumino, believes Wal-Mart’s U.S. online growth “is now well above the overall market,” which indicates they’re adding share. But there are other factors playing a role in the result.\n“[T]he figures include half a quarter of sales from recently acquired Jet.com, which flatters the results somewhat,” said Saunders in a note published Thursday. “Nonetheless, we believe that Walmart is now on much more positive trajectory in terms of both its e-commerce strategy and results.”\nSee also: Wal-Mart to take on Amazon with upgrades to its brick-and-mortar stores \nWalmart's Strategy on Food Safety and Affordability (3:07) Frank Yiannas, vice president of Food Safety at Walmart Stores, discusses the strategy for reducing risk and providing consumers with safe, affordable foods at America's largest grocery chain. He spoke with WSJ's Sarah Nassauer at the WSJ Global Food Forum in New York.\n“We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart’s investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working,” said The Buckingham Research Group in a note published Thursday. “However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly from fiscal second-quarter 2016.”\nWal-Mart highlighted food deflation, weather and currency impacts among the headwinds.\nWal-Mart shares are up 11.8% for the year so far while the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.47% is up 6.7% for the same period. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.19% is up 8.3% for 2016 so far.\nMore from MarketWatch Trump’s Infrastructure Investment Plan Evokes Ayn Rand Social Media Companies Tackle Fake News and Abuse Giuliani’s Trump-Like Audition for Secretary of State",

      "text": "Amazon is trying to get you used to the idea of speaking to Alexa – its artificial intelligence (AI) digital assistant. \nOn Friday, the U.S. e-commerce giant announced it was offering exclusive deals to its Prime members that can only be ordered through an Alexa-enabled device like an Amazon Echo – its smart speaker. \nUsers need to say, \"Alexa, what are your deals?\" The voice assistant will respond and allow people to order the deal via Amazon. \nThis is the first time Amazon has done Alexa-exclusive deals, and highlights the way the Seattle-based technology giant wants to expand the capabilities of its AI assistant as it faces competition from the likes of Apple's Siri and Google Assistant. \nSource: Amazon Amazon Echo Amazon recently expanded Echo into the U.K. and Germany after launching it in the U.S. in 2014. AI assistants are seen as the next battleground for technology companies as they can be integrated across different devices and keep users locked into an ecosystem. For example, Alexa is installed across Amazon's tablets, Fire TV and Echo. Amazon has also integrated it into hardware that it doesn't make – such as a connected thermostat called Ecobee. All the information Alexa Is gathering from users' requests can be used by Amazon to target customers with product recommendations. \nOther technology firms are also boosting the capabilities of their own AI digital assistants. Apple's Siri is now integrated into its wireless AirPods for example. Google Assistant is across Android devices, as well as in Google Home – the company's own smart speaker. Amazon's advantage currently is its ability to link Alexa to its e-commerce business. \nRevenue from smart audio hardware will more than triple over the next four years, rising from an estimated $1.4 billion this year to over $5.5 billion by 2020, according to Juniper Research, so it's seen as big business for technology players. \nAnd gathering data through voice can also help companies like Google, Amazon and Apple, personalize their services even further. \nAmazon's exclusive Alexa deals start on Friday and go through November and December, which includes the upcoming Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events. \nDeals this weekend include a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV for $119 or $30 on a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 App controlled robot. \nPrime members who have \"1-click\" check-out enabled on their Amazon account will be able to shop via Alexa.",

Now, it looks like Amazon is all set to launch its video streaming service globally and take on Netflix. Long wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW — Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nAmazon has suggested that it will launch Prime Video service in more than 200 countries including India next month. The company shared the details of launch while promoting its latest big budget show, The Grand Tour. In September, Amazon teamed up with Dharma Productions to stream films and upcoming new releases. The company has also partnered with Vishesh Films. Amazon also singed a deal with SS Rajamouli, Graphic India and Arka Mediaworks for a multi-episode animated series titled – Baahubali: The Lost Legends based on the popular movie Baahubali, which will premiere first on Amazon Prime Video India in 2017. \nNetflix forayed into Indian market at the beginning of this year along with 128 other countries. Plans for the US based popular TV shows and movie streaming service start at Rs. 500. Meanwhile, Amazon Prime was launched in India with an introductory price of Rs 499, which is valid for a year. There is however no word on whether the Prime Video service will be included in the current package, or it will be a paid add-on. A message from the guys. pic.twitter.com/p1IJNRjAnS — The Grand Tour (@thegrandtour) November 16, 2016  ",

      "text": "San Francisco (AFP) - Amazon is poised to challenge Netflix on the global stage with a massive expansion of its on-demand video streaming service, The Wall Street Journal reported.\nAmazon Prime Video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, with a promise of availability soon in India.\nPrime will likely expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Journal report.\nThis would put the Seattle-based online retail titan's on-demand video service on a level playing field with Netflix, which at the start of this year expanded to 190 countries to proclaim itself the first global television service.\nWhen contacted by AFP, an Amazon spokeswoman would only confirm that a popular original show titled \"The Grand Tour\" and devoted to cars would launch in more than 200 countries in December.\n\"We don't have anything else to announce,\" she said.\nThe worldwide, exclusive availability of \"The Grand Tour\" and its mention in a tweet fired off by Amazon founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos will likely fuel speculation that this a first step toward a full-fledged global Prime Video service that will directly challenge Netflix.\nHow the show would be made available was not specified, meaning Amazon could opt to let people buy episodes from its online shop in some places rather than make it available on-demand at the Prime streaming service.\nIf Amazon Prime Video expands globally, it will be the most formidable rival to Netflix at a time when the California-based company's ability to win new fans is being closely watched by investors.\n- Eyes on Netflix -\nNetflix last month posted earnings that alleviated concerns over growth.\nThe company said it had gained 3.57 million paid subscribers to its streaming service in the recently ended quarter -- most of them from outside the United States -- and finished the quarter with a higher-than-expected 86.74 million subscribers.\nOf that number, 39.25 million subscribers were international, a sign that the company was gaining momentum as a global television service.\nFor the current quarter Netflix forecasted a gain of 5.2 million subscribers, predicting 3.75 million of them would come from countries outside the US.\nThe service credited a robust lineup of original programming, including \"Stranger Things\" and \"Narcos,\" with helping draw customers.\nThe earnings report reassured investors after growth of only 1.68 million subscribers in the previous quarter had dampened enthusiasm for Netflix shares on Wall Street.\nThe on-demand television service credited with giving rise to \"binge viewing\" has won devotees with its own hit shows, including \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange is the New Black.\"\n- Offering originals -\nNetflix has planned for more than 1,000 hours of original programming next year and expanded its content budget to some $6 billion.\nOnline platforms Netflix and Amazon Prime Video have both ramped up their investment in programming, together spending some $7.5 billion -- more than competitors CBS, HBO, or Turner, according to IHS Markit.\nPrime Video is a popular perk of an Amazon subscription service that includes free delivery of products bought at its online store.\nLike Netflix, Amazon has invested heavily in original programming to win subscribers.\nOriginal Amazon productions \"Transparent\" and \"Mozart in the Jungle\" won Emmy Awards, considered prestigious television accolades in the US.\nAmazon has not disclosed the number of Prime subscribers, but research company CIRP estimated in late September that in the US alone there were 65 million, up 38 percent from a year earlier.",

      "text": "\nIn a surprising reveal at CES 2016 keynote, Netflix co-founder and CEO Reed Hastings announced that Netflix was rolling out globally bring its Internet TV network to more than 130-countries around the world. The streaming service was previously available in parts of the Americas, parts of Europe and South East Asia. Since its global expansion, Netflix has added thousands of users besides allowing millions of others to access its content.\nE-commerce retailer Amazon has had its video streaming service out for a while and has been looking to create original content for the service. The service, Amazon Prime Video has also been slowly expanding and has now hinted at a major global expansion. Amazon Prime Video is presently only available in five countries — the U.S., UK, Germany, Austria and Japan. According to Tech Crunch, the service has hinted it will expand to cover 200 markets worldwide from December.\nLate last year, BBC lost the presenters of one of the most popular motoring shows Top Gear. This was owing to an altercation that took place between one of the hosts and the show’s producers. Following the exit, a bidding war emerged among various networks and even streaming services each looking to create a motoring show. From Amazon to Netflix, Sky to ITV, each sought to acquire the services of the former Top Gear hosts. Amazon won the bidding war and channeled $250 Million towards the creation of a new motoring show aptly called The Grand Tour. The Grand Tour is set to premier today November 18th and the launch by Amazon is meant to capitalize on the popularity of the show.\nThe Grand Tour rolled out on Amazon Prime in the five markets yesterday and is set to go global in December according to a tweet by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos. The move by Amazon is certainly as Amazon Prime is cheaper than Netflix (about Kshs. 10,000 a year), and offer free unlimited streaming content, prime music (unlimited access to music), prime photos (unlimited storage of photos), prime reading (borrow books and magazines) as well as membership sharing.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \n\nRead On Web → Amazon Prime Video to take on Netflix with Expansion to 200 Countries WorldWide \n",

It's the kind of imperfection that doesn't seem worth pulling down the awkward ironing board and firing up the insufficient hotel iron. That's where the Collar Perfect handheld iron presents the perfect solution. Reminiscent of a flip phone, only made for stubborn clothing wrinkles, the device hugs collars and cuffs when closed, or folds open to tackle larger areas like pant legs. Any sartorially-minded traveller will quickly see the value in this unusual—and convenient—holiday gift. Available on Amazon ; $34.95.",

      "title": "REVIEW: The Grand Tour is like the original Top Gear on Viagra",
      "text": "The former BBC Dream Team are back with their new show The Grand Tour (Picture: Amazon) The terrible trio have finally pulled out of their career lay-bys to shoot sand into the faces of BBC executives with their spinning Pirelli tyres. \nYes, The Grand Tour is finally here — and there’s absolutely zero doubt that fans of the original show have everything they could ever dream of and more with this Amazon Prime offering.\nAlmost two years on from the punching incident, Jeremy Clarkson, James May and Richard Hammond have brought us what is essentially an expat version of the original Top Gear, with more eye-popping landscape shots and camera filters.\nThe opening of the episode is spectacular (Picture: Amazon) The hosts’ deviant obsession with speed, their childish rivalry, and the laughter at the expense of the Prius, May and foreigners all remain in tact. Volkswagen gets a kicking, too, of course.\nUnsurprisingly, The Grand Tour opens with a not-very-disgraced-looking Clarkson emerging from BBC studios in the rain — before swiftly jetting off to LA and jumping into an electric blue Mustang, the stuff of Fast And Furious: Tokyo Drift dreams.\nCar rock stars roll up (Picture: Amazon) Soon he is joined by May and Hammond in red and white cars, and they arrive as bona fide, headlining rock stars at their own festival in the desert. No, we aren’t joking.\nAfter that indulgent pre-amble, episode one — entitled, we sh*t you not, The Holy Trinity — settles in a makeshift studio, complete with a fake scenery backdrop. Then the real action, and the exciting VT sequences, can commence.\nHammond, Clarkson and May show up to their new job (Picture: Amazon) And commence they do, with many a thrilling, worrying and stratospherically-expensive drive-off zipping by. Only James May can still make the 950-horsepower ‘Ferrarri: The Ferrari’ seem as sexy as popping out for a pint of milk, and we love him for that.\nClassy editing and camera work ensures these segments never miss a beat. There are also jokes a-plenty about Clarkson’s ‘racism’ and ‘bigotry’, which may sit well with some viewers and not others.\nSome poor Belgian driver gets mistranslated (Picture: Amazon) MORE: Matt LeBlanc tweets first photo back at work on Top Gear \nYes, it’s a little uncomfortable when Clarkson suggests he could now ‘pleasure a horse’ and not get fired thanks to ‘the internet’.\nBut you can hardly expect him to dial down the embarrassing brain farts now Amazon Prime’s given him carte blanche.\nIs this going to be an actual feature? (Picture: Amazon) MORE: Jeremy Clarkson claims he is the victim of ‘a hate crime’ after he misses his flight \nA lot of the humour does seem very fresh, particularly during one moment when three of the show’s A-List guests — Jeremy Renner, Armie Hammer and Carol Vorderman — die before they can appear on the show’s new Celebrity Brain Crash segment, which may or may not be a thing.\n\nHowever, two of them almost undo the effects of this good writing with unnecessary references to bodily functions.\nTMI Jez (Picture: Amazon) MORE: BBC ‘whitewash all traces of Chris Evans’ ahead of Top Gear return \n‘If I went this fast in the McLaren, a LOT of poo would come out.’\nOhh… Really, Jeremy?\nPowerful wheels (Picture: Amazon) ‘I didn’t think it was possible to sh*t yourself to death.’\nNot you as well, Hammond!\nL ds (Picture: Amazon) Still, it’s wonderful to see The Grand Tour doesn’t take itself seriously at all, and those who think Clarkson is a p**lock will enjoy the ending of the episode, where he essentially loses his house in a bet. At least he can build a new one with his Amazon fee.\nOverall, it’s as if not one day has passed since Clarkson floored someone for failing to present him with a steak. It’s just another very luxurious, high-octane day at the office for the world’s most Marmite Motor Musketeers, and they’re having fun, which naturally makes the show fun.\nThe Grand Tour is a festival of schoolboy fun (Picture: Amazon) Clarkson and his chums, have the kind of natural camaraderie that knocks down Chris Evans and Matt LeBlanc’s meagre BBC presenting efforts like a feather. RIP Top Gear. Long live The Grand Tour!\nThe Grand Tour is available to watch now on Amazon Prime. \nMORE: What on earth is happening on Top Gear?

      "text": "E-commerce sales rise but profit falls as retailer spends big to compete with Amazon\nBy Sarah Nassauer and Joshua Jamerson\nWal-Mart Stores Inc. drew more shoppers to its U.S. stores but the pace of visits slowed and profits fell as the retailer spends heavily to catch up with Amazon.com Inc.\nSame-store sales in the U.S. rose 1.2% for the quarter, the ninth straight increase, and foot traffic rose 0.7%, down from the previous quarter's rise. Meanwhile, e-commerce sales were up 21%, boosted by the purchase of online retailer Jet.com in September.\nWal-Mart's stock fell 4.4% to $68.24 in early trading, as the revenue gains were less than some analysts projected and traffic slowed slightly compared with the previous quarter. On a conference call with reporters, executives said the strong dollar continued to eat into overseas revenue.\nHeading into the critical holiday season, Wal-Mart executives said they are optimistic that consumer spending will stay relatively solid, as it has in recent quarters, even in the wake of a tense U.S. presidential election.\n\"I don't see big changes out there,\" said U.S. chief Greg Foran on a call with reporters. \"Business as usual would be my summation.\"\nWal-Mart is investing heavily to fend off Amazon's play for more retail turf. It will have added over a 1,000 online grocery pickup locations at stores by the end of next year. It also made the biggest ever e-commerce startup purchase when it bought Jet.com, installing Jet founder Marc Lore as head of its e-commerce business. E-commerce sales added 0.5% to the U.S. same-store sales figure, the largest contribution to date, said executives. Jet.com added six weeks of sales to the results.\nWal-Mart has also slowed the pace of new store openings, instead investing to improve existing stores. The world's largest retailer has raised employee's' wages, added management training programs and trimmed inventory.\nThe increase in U.S. same-store sales was driven by strength in its general merchandise and health and wellness business, while its grocery business continued to lag amid food-price deflation.\n\"We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart's investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working. However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly\" from last quarter, said Buckingham Research Group in a note. The number of shoppers heading to U.S. stores rose 1.2% in the previous quarter.\nThe results from Wal-Mart come a day after rival Target Corp. said sales in existing stores fell slightly, but it signaled sales could return to growth over the holiday season. While department stores and some apparel makers reported slower sales in recent weeks, Home Depot Inc., Best Buy Co. and others said sales are brisk ahead of the holidays. Earlier this week, October retail sales logged their best growth rate in nearly two years.\nRetailers are in a race to log as many sales as possible before Christmas, a stretch that can make or break a retailer's financials for the year.\nCharlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's, said Wal-Mart is poised for strong holiday sales in the fourth quarter as the company \"leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy-online/pick-up-in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com.\"\nAmazon currently has about 3% of total U.S. retail sales compared with a 7% share held by Wal-Mart, according to a recent estimate from Citi.\nFor this year's holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart is focused on improving in-store pickup of online orders and working to speed checkout times, said Mr. Foran.\n\"Holiday helpers,\" store workers wearing Santa hats and passing out candy, will be on-hand during peak hours to open registers or direct shoppers to the shortest checkout line. \"We know that our front end, particularly in our big trading stores can get a bit clogged\" at the register, said Mr. Foran.\nOver all, Wal-Mart posted a profit of $3.03 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. The company had projected per-share earnings in a range of 90 cents to $1.\nRevenue edged up 0.7% to $118.2 billion, below analysts' projections for $118.69 billion.\nWal-Mart also lifted the bottom end of its full-year guidance range for adjusted profit, now expecting $4.20 to $4.35 a share. Previously, the low-end was pegged at $4.15.\nWrite to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com and Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires\nNovember 18, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

      "text": "\nAmazon has provided a number of ways to help consumers spend cash this holiday season. From early Black Friday sales, to buyers guides, to deals available exclusively through its digital assistant Alexa; the latter of which, you can take advantage of this weekend.\nUntil November 21, Amazon is holding a sale for its Prime members which can only be purchased via Alexa. Just ask “Alexa, what are your deals?” to one of Amazon’s speakers like the Echo, Echo Dot and Amazon Tap – or to a Fire TV or Fire HD Tablet – to receive a list of potential items for purchase (you can also view all of the deals online here ).\nSee also: Amazon kicks off its massive Black Friday sale with list of the best deals on offer 2 days ago When you’ve found what you want, just say “Alexa, order [product name]” to place your order. The items on offer are set to change throughout the coming days, but as of the time of writing you can cash-in on deals like:\n$80 off a 32-inch Samsung 1080p LED TV: say, “Alexa, order a Samsung TV” $30 off a Sphero Star Wars BB-8 App controlled robot: say, “Alexa, order a Star Wars robot” $50 off an Amazon Tap: say, “Alexa, order an Amazon Tap” $80 off Beyerdynamic Limited Edition Headphones: say, “Alexa, order studio headphones” $6 off a Garth Brooks Ultimate Hits CD: say, “Alexa, order a Garth Brooks CD” (no, really.) Check out the deals for yourself at Amazon and let us know in the comments if there’s anything worth picking up.",

On a conference call with reporters, executives said the strong dollar continued to eat into overseas revenue.\nHeading into the critical holiday season, Wal-Mart executives said they are optimistic that consumer spending will stay relatively solid, as it has in recent quarters, even in the wake of a tense U.S. presidential election.\n\"I don't see big changes out there,\" said U.S. chief Greg Foran on a call with reporters. \"Business as usual would be my summation.\"\nWal-Mart is investing heavily to fend off Amazon's play for more retail turf. It will have added over a 1,000 online grocery pickup locations at stores by the end of next year. It also made the biggest ever e-commerce startup purchase when it bought Jet.com, installing Jet founder Marc Lore as head of its e-commerce business. E-commerce sales added 0.5% to the U.S. same-store sales figure, the largest contribution to date, said executives. Jet.com added six weeks of sales to the results.\nWal-Mart has also slowed the pace of new store openings, instead investing to improve existing stores. The world's largest retailer has raised employee's' wages, added management training programs and trimmed inventory.\nThe increase in U.S. same-store sales was driven by strength in its general merchandise and health and wellness business, while its grocery business continued to lag amid food-price deflation.\n\"We view the same-store sales growth as evidence that Wal-Mart's investment in labor, e-commerce and marketing its value message are working. However, some investors may be disappointed that traffic and comps decelerated slightly\" from last quarter, said Buckingham Research Group in a note. The number of shoppers heading to U.S. stores rose 1.2% in the previous quarter.\nThe results from Wal-Mart come a day after rival Target Corp. said sales in existing stores fell slightly, but it signaled sales could return to growth over the holiday season. While department stores and some apparel makers reported slower sales in recent weeks, Home Depot Inc., Best Buy Co. and others said sales are brisk ahead of the holidays. Earlier this week, October retail sales logged their best growth rate in nearly two years.\nRetailers are in a race to log as many sales as possible before Christmas, a stretch that can make or break a retailer's financials for the year.\nCharlie O'Shea, lead retail analyst at Moody's, said Wal-Mart is poised for strong holiday sales in the fourth quarter as the company \"leverages its store network to handle online orders, especially via its buy-online/pick-up-in-store capability, as well as increasing benefits from Jet.com.\"\nAmazon currently has about 3% of total U.S. retail sales compared with a 7% share held by Wal-Mart, according to a recent estimate from Citi.\nFor this year's holiday shopping season, Wal-Mart is focused on improving in-store pickup of online orders and working to speed checkout times, said Mr. Foran.\n\"Holiday helpers,\" store workers wearing Santa hats and passing out candy, will be on-hand during peak hours to open registers or direct shoppers to the shortest checkout line. \"We know that our front end, particularly in our big trading stores can get a bit clogged\" at the register, said Mr. Foran.\nOver all, Wal-Mart posted a profit of $3.03 billion, or 98 cents a share, compared with $3.3 billion, or $1.03 a share, a year ago. The company had projected per-share earnings in a range of 90 cents to $1.\nRevenue edged up 0.7% to $118.2 billion, below analysts' projections for $118.69 billion.\nWal-Mart also lifted the bottom end of its full-year guidance range for adjusted profit, now expecting $4.20 to $4.35 a share. Previously, the low-end was pegged at $4.15.\nWrite to Sarah Nassauer at sarah.nassauer@wsj.com and Joshua Jamerson at joshua.jamerson@wsj.com\n 18, 2016 02:47 ET (07:47 ",

      "text": "\n* Morrisons steps up Amazon partnership \n* Prime customers in and around London offered same-day delivery \n* Online food sales expanding rapidly in Britain (Adds detail, background, shares) \nLONDON, Nov 16 (Reuters) - British supermarket Morrisons has set up a new service that will offer Amazon Prime customers same-day deliveries of groceries from its stores, deepening the relationship between the two companies. \nShares in Morrisons, up 50 percent so far this year, added 0.7 percent by 0830 GMT, valuing the business at 5.2 billion pounds. Shares in online grocery company Ocado, which has its own agreement with Morrisions, fell more than 5 percent. \nIn February Morrisons agreed a deal with Amazon that saw it begin wholesale supply to the Internet firm from June. It said that service had started well and been extended to thousands of Morrisons' products. \nThe new \"Morrisons at Amazon\" service will allow Amazon Prime customers in and around London to order the full range of Morrisons' products online via Amazon's Prime Now app. The service was launching on Wednesday. \nAmazon is promoting its Prime service heavily ahead of the launch on Nov.18 of motoring show \"The Grand Tour\" presented by Jeremy Clarkson. \nMorrisons is the smallest of Britain's \"big four\" supermarkets which have come under pressure from the rise of German discounters Aldi and Lidl. \nHowever, the online food market is expanding quickly and is expected to grow by 68 percent to 17.9 billion pounds ($22.35 billion) in the five years to 2021, according to industry research group IGD. \nOrders will be picked by shop staff at a local Morrisons store and delivered the same day by Amazon either within one hour for 6.99 pounds ($8.72) or within a two-hour slot for free. \nThe service will launch in selected postcodes in London and Hertfordshire, north of the capital. \nMorrisons said its partnership with Amazon will contribute to a 50-100 million pounds profit boost it has previously targeted. \n\"For Morrisons this broadens the offer and gives them more ways to reach customers online where they are still in the early stages of development. For Amazon this is one of a vast number of things they are trialling,\" said Bernstein analyst Bruno Monteyne, who has a \"market perform\" rating on Morrisons. \nThe partnership put pressure on Ocado shares. Morrisons also has a distribution deal with Ocado that sees Morrisons products delivered to customers from Ocado's distribution centres. \nThat agreement was renegotiated in August allowing Morrisons to extend home delivery to its customers across the country using its own stores to provide products. Morrisons has said it will commence that service next year. ($1 = 0.8010 pounds) (Reporting by James Davey; Editing by Susan Fenton/Keith Weir) Read the original article on Reuters . Copyright 2016.

      "text": "Amazon's Alexa will send texts to AT&T Customers (starting tomorrow 11/18) HowardForums is a discussion board dedicated to mobile phones with over 1,000,000 members and growing! For your convenience HowardForums is divided into 7 main sections; marketplace, phone manufacturers, carriers, smartphones/PDAs, general phone discussion, buy sell trade and general discussions. Just scroll down to see them! Only registered members may post questions, contact other members or search our database of over 8 million posts. Why don't you join us today! If you have time check out our sister site: Niknon.com - a forum about Digital Photography. Results 1 to 2 of 2 &T just announced that beginning tomorrow, its mobile customers will be able to compose and send text messages using Amazons Alexa assistant. So if youve got an Echo, Echo Tap, or Echo Dot somewhere in the house, you can ask Alexa to have AT&T text a contacts name (Alexa can store up to 10), followed by your message. Youve got to take that first step of adding people to the skill before Alexa can do anything; you cant just call out the name of anyone in your contact list, for example. &T claims its the first carrier to offer an Alexa skill for SMS, and naturally the company sees it being most useful if youre in a hurry or busy with your hands. The website with all the specifics on this feature isnt live yet, so its not clear whether Alexa reads your spoken message back to you before firing it off to the recipient. Maybe stick with your phone for the important texts, but having Alexa as a relay for the everyday stuff sounds pretty convenient. As always, standard text messaging and data rates apply, and AT&Ts fine print says content of texts sent by AT&T are determined by Alexas reading of your voice commands. Thats another way of saying if Alexa completely misunderstands you and blows up a conversation, its all Amazons fault.",

      "text": "Amazon now offering unique deals for Echo, Dot, Tap and tablet users November 18th, 2016 at 11:11 am - Author Jon Martindale \nIn a continued move to have all of its customers use as many of its products as possible, Amazon is now offering unique deals to those who order products using their voice. If you have an Alexa based device like Amazon Echo, Dot, Tap, Fire Tablet or Fire TV, you can order select products with big discounts, just because you did it with the power of your voice. \n“This is the first holiday that Prime members will be able to use their voice to shop and we’re excited to offer exclusive deals they won’t find anywhere else,” said Assaf Ronen, VP of voice shopping. \nI won’t be detailing the individual deals Amazon has on offer, as this isn’t some kind of sponsored post for the company, but suffice to say they cover everything from TVs to batteries and in some cases with $100+ discounts. These deals will be available until the 21st November while supplies last. Amazon also plans to introduce other Alexa-exclusive deals on Black Friday (25th Nov.) and Cyber Monday (28th Nov.), as well as just about every day leading up to Christmas. \nHowever it’s worth remembering that you don’t have to only buy these items using Alexa. The voice activated system lets you buy anything from the Prime-list by saying “Alexa, order [product],” and then confirming the purchase with a yes. Your account will then be automatically debited and the product shipped to you using Prime’s speedy delivery service. The caveat there is that you must be a Prime member and have 1-click shopping enabled. \nKitGuru Says: I’m not a huge fan of the big consumer push this time of year – we have enough pressure with Christmas coming up. At least if there’s an online rush for discounts though, nobody is getting trampled to death.",

      "title": "Samsung SmartCam PT review: This pan-and-tilt camera lets you peer into blind spots",
      "text": "View on Amazon SmartCam PT is an excellent pan-and-tilt camera for monitoring pets and kids or keeping an eye on your home. \nSamsung’s SmartCam HD Plus was one of the first DIY security camera’s we reviewed that improved upon the Dropcam blueprint. Now Samsung has added the SmartCam PT ($229) to its lineup. This pan-and-tilt model lets you see into the blind spots stationary home security cameras can’t reach, and it comes with a few well-thought-out features that set it apart from its many competitors. \nIf you’re of a certain age, the SmartCam PT ( available at Amazon ) will likely evoke the old Apollo command modules: a truncated cone that comes to a blunt point. The hollowed out center holds the camera itself, and the black upper part of the cone swivels on its gray base. Set on a shelf, it doubles as an interesting knick-knack, but you can also secure it to a supplied bracket with thumbscrew and mount to a wall. \nThe camera's lens has a 96-degree field of view, and the unit it’s housed in pans 350 degrees and tilts on a 155-degrees arc. This flexibility allows for set-it-and-forget it placement; once the camera is pointed toward the room you want to monitor, you’ll have a lot of viewing-angle options without ever needing to manually reposition the camera. Samsung \nThe SmartCam PT can be attached to a bracket for wall mounting. \nThe SmartCam PT boasts most of the features we now expect from home security cameras, including motion and sound alerts, two-way audio, and night vision. But it also includes a few surprises, such as a privacy mode you can enable when you’re in your home, and an auto-tracking feature that allows the camera to follow a single person or object. \nLike the Samsung SmartCam HD Plus, the SmartCam PT can record up to 128GB locally to an onboard microSD card. That saves you the cost of an ongoing cloud subscription, but it leaves the security of your surveillance footage to the whims of potential intruders who could easily compromise the camera. Setup and usage \nThe SmartCam PT is controlled with the same Samsung SmartCam app as the HD Plus. The initial setup is refreshingly easy, requiring you only to press the Wi-Fi setup button on the underside of the camera’s base for the app to see it, and then follow onscreen prompts to connect to your wireless network. There’s also an option for connecting the camera over your hardwired LAN. \nOnce the SmartCam PT is connected, it appears with the name you gave it during the setup process—along with any other connected Samsung camera’s you might have—on the app’s home screen. Tapping on it takes you the camera’s live feed and command center. From there, you can manually record video to either the microSD card or to your smartphone when you see some action you want to capture, or trigger the mic to communicate with kids or console a lonely pet you’re monitoring. You can also adjust the feed’s resolution using low, medium, or high presets, although you likely won’t toggle it much as pixels become more obvious on the lower settings. Samsung \nA pan-and-tilt feature allows the SmartCam PT to see into blind spots. \nThe camera’s biggest hook is its motorized pan-and-tilt, and that’s also its greatest strength. Using the four directional buttons, you can long-press to move the camera smoothly along its horizontal or vertical travel, or tap them for incremental movement when you hear something off-camera or just want to perform a sweep of the room. Unlike a lot of pan-and-tilt camera’s, the SmartCam PT has only the tiniest response lag when initiating or stopping camera movement, making this feature very precise. You can also set presets of up to three camera positions that can be triggered with a single touch. \nThe SmartCam PT’s Auto Track is a handy feature if you want the camera to shadow a child or pet you’ve left at home. Tapping the Auto Track button, which looks like a set of crosshairs, locks the camera on to the nearest moving object. It works really well, though it sometimes had trouble distinguishing between a moving body and a moving body part . At one point, I had the camera trained on my son as he played in the living room. The SmartCam PT dutifully bird-dogged him around until he unexpectedly shot an arm in the air, which sent the camera careening upward until it locked on his hand. \nAuto Track will lock onto and follow the nearest person or object. \nOut of the box, I found the SmartCam PT’s motion and audio detection a little too sensitive, which caused a bombardment of alerts over benign events. The SmartCam app lets you adjust the sensitivity of audio and motion sensors independently—or turn either off completely—and with some trial and error it was fairly easy to get a more balanced calibration. \nYou can also restrict monitoring to up to three motion-detection zones, such as entry points to a room, which significantly cuts down on false alarms. \nEven better is the camera’s privacy mode. Instead of turning off motion and audio detection or unplugging the camera when you get home, you can activate this feature, which tilts the camera toward its base and shuts it down. You can also schedule privacy mode to activate automatically at certain times of day, such as when your children get home from school if you’re monitoring while you’re at work. \nThe SmartCam PT records video at up to 1080p and that’s the resolution you’ll want, as the lower settings are noticeably less sharp. The FullHD setting renders crisp detail, rich colors, and smooth playback making it easy to make out faces in both day and night mode should you have to identify a burglar. \nSadly, finding your recorded video clips can be confounding, at least at first. They’re accessed from three different menus, depending on how they were captured. Recordings triggered by sound or motion can be found by date and time in a dedicated Events folder. Manually recorded videos saved to your phone separately and are presented in a list. You just tap one to play it back. Those recorded to microSD card are accessed through yet another playback menu that requires you to choose calendar date and recording type—manual or event-activated—to see your footage. It’s the biggest flaw in an otherwise intuitive app, but once you get the lay of the land it's less bothersome. Bottom line \nThe SmartCam PT is a great way to monitor a large space without needing to purchase multiple cameras. Its auto-tracking feature is particularly useful if you’re planning to use it as a pet or nanny cam. But it costs significantly more than the D-Link and Vimtag pan-and-tilt security cameras that deliver equally good video quality, but that don't have a couple of the fancy features that Samsung has come up with. If your budget is tight, you’d be just as happy with one of those models. \nIf you don't mind paying more to get more, the onboard storage, auto-tracking, privacy mode, and other added features justify the price premium Samsung is seeking.

      "text": "London (AFP) - The former presenters of hit British motoring show \"Top Gear\" Friday received glowing reviews as their new show \"The Grand Tour\" debuted on Amazon Prime, signalling the video streaming service's global arrival. Lead presenter Jeremy Clarkson was dropped from the BBC show in 2015 for punching a producer, but has reunited with co-hosts James May and Richard Hammond for the high-budget \"Grand Tour\", with early reviews praising the lavish production.\n\"It is, undeniably, a brilliant beautiful spectacle,\" wrote the Guardian, while popular tabloid The Sun said it was \"dripping with extravagance\".\nThe series, which premiered in Britain, the United States, Germany and Japan on Thursday, opened with a thinly-veiled dig at the BBC.\nIt showed a morose Clarkson handing his pass in at a drab office in rainy London, before catching a plane to sunny California and picking up a Ford Mustang to lead a fleet of muscle cars, classic cars, motorbikes and jet planes into the desert.\nThe spectacular introduction was alone reported to have cost £2.5 million ($3.1 million, 2.9 million euros), while Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos described the whole production as \"very, very, very expensive\".\nThe show's ambition is in stark contrast to the BBC's relaunch of \"Top Gear\", whose poor reviews led to the departure of host Chris Evans after the first series, with co-host Matt LeBlanc to take over.\n\"The new series will certainly go some way towards obliterating memories of TG's terrible Chris Evans-fronted relaunch,\" said the Daily Telegraph.\n\"The BBC may wonder how Matt LeBlanc and whoever joins him next year can possibly compete.\"\n- Top Gear fans will 'be happy' -\nClarkson appeared not to have toned down his trademark politically incorrect humour, which landed him in frequent trouble with the BBC, joking that the new show's travelling format meant \"we're going to be like Gypsies, only the cars we drive are going to be insured\".\nHe later added that he could be even more outrageous \"because we're on the internet, which means I could pleasure a horse\".\nThe show was filmed in various locations, including Nashville, Loch Ness, Johannesburg, Lapland and Dubai, and unveiled its new testing track -- called the Eboladrome due to its resemblance to the Ebola virus -- and test driver, dubbed \"The American\".\n\"As Clarkson, Hammond and May settled into their studio tent, things started to feel awful familiar,\" said the Daily Telegraph. \"We could have been back in the Top Gear cowshed in Surrey.\"\n\"You can pour something into a different container, but it still tastes the same,\" added the Guardian. \"And, like it or not, this tastes of Clarkson, Hammond and May. Fans of old Top Gear are going to be happy.\"\nAn estimated 350 million viewers around the world tuned in to \"Top Gear\" each week to watch the three men review cars and try them out in madcap stunts, making it the world's most popular factual television programme.\nAmazon is the world's largest online retailer and Prime, an internet streaming service similar to Netflix, offers subscribers access to thousands of films and television shows, including original content.\nIts video service is currently available in Austria, Britain, Germany, Japan and the United States, but is soon to expand to some 200 countries and territories, according to the Wall Street Journal.",

      "text": "11/18/16 AT 6:26 AM Close \nAmazon is preparing for the global rollout of its video streaming service. The company will compete against leading streaming services such as Netflix and Hulu. It plans to roll out the service in 200 countries and territories. Currently, Amazon Prime video is available just in U.S., U.K., Germany Austria and Japan, with an Indian launch coming out soon. \nActor Jeremy Clarkson stars in “The Grand Tour,” an Amazon Prime video exclusive, tweeted that “Amazon has gone global.\" \nAmazon's service will compete with Netflix, which already has a worldwide presence. \nBoth companies have different approaches to video streaming internationally. Netflix purchases streaming rights to shows that have a common connect globally, such as \"How I Met Your Mother.\" \nAmazon, on the other hand, is working on creating local content for each market. Amazon's streaming model therefore, requires more investment than Netflix. The Wall Street Journal estimates that Amazon would be spending anywhere from $4 billion-$5 billion on video outlays. This gives the company ownership of the content. \nNetflix definitely has a first mover advantage since it moved to markets such as India earlier. But it has consciously chosen against the regional presence that Amazon is building on. Related Stories Amazon Prime Coming To China \n“There’s no point in us trying to out-Bollywood Bollywood at this point,” Netflix Chief Executive Reed Hastings told the Wall StreetJournal. \nAmazon's approach is underlined by Amazon Studios CEO Roy Price, “You can have a global service, but there are no global customers, there are only local customers.” \nBoth streaming services can be used across a variety of devices. \nNetflix currently has a consumer base of 87 million subscribers. The exact number of Amazon Prime Video users is not yet available, but the Prime service has 60 million subscribers. In the U.S., Amazon Prime offers access to 10,000 videos for $79 an year while Netflix charges $96 per year and offers both DVDs and online streaming content.

      "text": "Enter comment about this deal... 2000 characters remaining Spoofee (Spoofee.com!) - 6 hours ago Deal is back for this year! $79 for new members Guest - 10 months ago Don't worry - they make their money back. Just received (3 day shipping by the way not 2 as advertised) a Roku 4 at full price that was previously used, fingerprints and all even the obligatory hair included! Amazon is just not what it used to be. Guest - 10 months ago Even at $99 the Prime membership is a hell of a deal. I would not be surprised to see it go to $129 at some point. I've been a member since Prime started and I know I've paid for the fee a couple of times each year from my shipping alone. ShadowFalls (L11 Sergeant) - 10 months ago Got to love favoring only newcomers. Guest - 10 months ago Two day shipping? Via USPS? If you expect them to ship via UPS or FedEx - good luck! Guest - 1 year ago I didn't do it!! Guest - 1 year ago 'Rumor has it the price is dropping permanently from $99 down to this $72 price-point in the very near future... so says 'tech bits' on ABC World News'I doubt this is true. It was originally $79 and I read they were taking a bath at that price point so they moved it to $99. To go to a lower price of $72 would not make sense unless they changed the benefits. Guest - 1 year ago Not for new members only. I bought myself a 'gift' and when I did, and went to activate it, it gave me $72 Amazon credit Guest - 1 year ago But once you buy it as a gift (for yourself) don't you have to start using it right away? How long can you hold onto this gift before you have to activate it? Guest - 1 year ago This deal does not work if you have already signed up and are on your 1 month free trial or if you are already a Prime member. I'm 1 week into a Prime trial and tried to purchase this and no go. :-( Guest - 1 year ago Rumor has it the price is dropping permanently from $99 down to this $72 price-point in the very near future... so says 'tech bits' on ABC World News Guest - 1 year ago It's a great deal I've had prime for awhile now and LOVE it Guest - 1 year ago 27% off, not bad! Remember you can buy it and gift to yourself for next year if you already have an active membership. I've done this twice now. Guest - 1 year ago It's less then a year of Netflix, either price. elvisaintdead (L9 Corporal) - 1 year ago Not for a year. $6/month for 2 day shipping AND all the Prime video is a darn sweet deal. Guest - 1 year ago It's only for new members. Guest - 1 year ago",

      "text": "Amazon Challenges Netflix by Taking Video Service Global Lucas Shaw November 17, 2016 — 3:55 PM EST November 17, 2016 — 5:04 PM EST Online retailer now seeks global rights to TV shows, movies “The Grand Tour” to be available worldwide starting next month \nAmazon.com Inc. is preparing to take its video streaming service worldwide in a challenge to Netflix Inc., the world’s largest paid online TV network. \nAmazon, which currently offers the service in only a handful of countries, announced the plans Thursday in a blog post about “The Grand Tour,” a lavish new reality show featuring the former stars of BBC’s popular “Top Gear.” \n“In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon,” the company wrote on its website . Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also mentioned the plans on Twitter. \nAmazon, the world’s biggest online retailer, has spent billions of dollars licensing programming and producing original shows and movies as part of its Prime service. Customers who pay $99 a year for free shipping and other benefits get access to a library of new and older content at no added cost. \nThe expansion of the Seattle-based company’s video service is one of the biggest challenges yet to Netflix, which operates in more than 190 countries after completing its international rollout in January. It is available everywhere except Syria, North Korea, China and Crimea, the company said at the time. \nSally Fouts, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon’s plans earlier Thursday. Video Strategy \nThe online retailer has funded its video service to increase sales of other products such as shoes, laundry detergent and books. People who watch videos on Amazon are likely to stick around and shop for other products as well. \nTo offer video service around the world, Amazon has to obtain global rights and satisfy local regulators. The company began seeking worldwide rights to shows this year, a sign of its plans to expand, according to people familiar with the matter who weren’t authorized to speak publicly and asked not to be identified. \nIt makes sense for Amazon to push its original programming in other markets, but securing the rights to distribute its entire catalog of movies and shows worldwide would be expensive, said Michael Pachter, analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \n“They’re not paying FX to run ‘Justified’ in Scandinavia or Gabon,” Pachter said. “The stuff they own, sure, why not.” \nStreaming video services like YouTube and Netflix are popular in developed countries, especially the West. Foreign markets where fewer people have access to fixed broadband internet pose more of a challenge. \nAmazon earlier this year began selling a standalone video service to complement the existing product, which is an add-on to its Prime subscriptions. The video service will be introduced in new countries in time to offer “The Grand Tour.” Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.",
