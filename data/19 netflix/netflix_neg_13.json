      "text": "4K Netflix Streaming Finally Comes To The PC, But There’s A Catch  40 PST \nIs streaming Netflix in 4K on your PC something that you’ve been dying to do? For some reason this option has not been enabled for PC users for a while, despite it being available on other platforms and devices, at least until now. In an announcement on Microsoft’s website , it looks like 4K Netflix streaming is finally here. \n  there are several catches in order for you to stream Netflix. For starters you will need to have Windows 10 installed on your PC. Given the adoption rate we are seeing for the operating system, we guess this shouldn’t really be an issue. The second catch is that you will have to stream Netflix via the Microsoft Edge browser in order to get 4K, so if you’re using the dedicated Windows 10 app, you’ll have to make the switch. \nThen again Microsoft’s Edge browser has been getting some positive feedback, so it’s not such a bad thing to switch. The last catch might not be so easy to overcome. According to Microsoft, “To run Netflix in 4K on a PC device, it must have a 4K-capable screen and use a 7th Gen Intel Core Processor.” Yup, 4K streaming for Netflix on Windows 10 will require users to own an Intel Kaby Lake processor. \nIf your system is older than that, there’s no way to overcome this hurdle unless you were to upgrade your PC. However if you meet all the requirements, including owning a 4K display, then you’re good to go!",

      "text": "Glass 4 hours ago \nToday, Netflix released the first full-length trailer for Barry , a film about US president Barack Obama’s time as a student at Columbia University. \n“You a whole different type of brother,” a man says to a young Obama ( played by Devon Terrell ). “You do realize that, right?” \nTo say this film is timely would be a vast understatement. Several critics have called the biopic, which garnered positive reviews after premiering at the Toronto Film Festival, a moving story about race and identity in America. As soon as Obama hands over the White House keys to president-elect Donald Trump, the history of his presidency will begin to take shape, and works of art, like Barry , will help shape that story. \nObama was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii to a white mother (from Kansas) and a black father (from Kenya). He attended Occidental College in Los Angeles before transferring to Columbia as a junior in 1981, when the film takes place. \nBarry will explore “a pivotal year in the life of the future 44th President of the United States, during which he developed the foundations for his views on race, government, and what it means to be American,” according to Netflix . \nThis is the second film this year about the US president’s formative years. In August, Southside With You reimagined his first date with future wife and US first lady Michelle Obama, who was an attorney at a prominent Chicago law firm assigned to advise the eager summer associate in 1989. \nA president’s legacy (or any historical figure’s legacy, for that matter) and films about that person exist in a feedback loop. The legacy shapes how films depict a president, and those films, in turn, decide how he’s ultimately remembered. \nAlready there’s a sense that Obama’s place in the American cinematic library is unique. It’s rare for a sitting president to have multiple positive portrayals of him come out while he’s still in office. Barry is a far cry from 2006’s Death of a President , which imagined a fictional future in which then-president George W. Bush had been assassinated. \nEven Abraham Lincoln and George Washington, despite their iconic roles in American history, have rarely been the heroes of films. And cinematic depictions of John F. Kennedy, a glamorous president to whom Obama is often compared, have only hinted at the former president’s early life, instead focusing more on subjects tangential to him—his wife ( Jackie ), the Cuban Missile Crisis ( Thirteen Days ), or his shocking death at the hands of a sharpshooter, and the subsequent investigation ( JFK) . \nIn Obama’s case, Hollywood is thus far most interested in his formative years, when he was a young man of mixed race looking for his place in the world. While the more traditional biopics about his time in political office are surely to come, it’s telling that this aspect of the president’s life—his multiracial, multicultural, quintessentially American upbringing—is what filmmakers have emphasized. \nObama has helped future screenwriters out by writing two memoirs, Dreams from My Father and The Audacity of Hope , from which they’ll no doubt draw inspiration. It’s quite possible that Barack Obama will prove to be America’s most cinematic president, one whose life will continue to be explored by artists generations hence. Read full story",

Getty \n\"Black Hawk Down\" Any war movie will make you forget about the holidays and be thankful for simply being alive -- and this one is actually good. Warner Bros \n\"The In-Laws\" This remake of the 1979 classic will make you remember how disastrous parents-in-law can actually be and you'll be happy you skipped out on visiting yours this year. Buena Vista Pictures \n\"Armaggedon\" What better way to avoid the holidays than if Earth as we know it was about to end? For a two-and-a-half hours, you can experience the same fantasy. Six Entertainment \n\"The Human Centipede\" A crazed scientist kidnaps tourists and stitches their mouths to the each other's rectums so they resemble a centipede. Just reading the description that will make you glad you're not eating all that gross holiday food. Universal Pictures \n\"Jaws\" Here's one movie that won't leave you feeling eager to cuddle up with a loved one or missing your family. On the contrary, it'll probably leave you scarred for life and fearful of ever stepping foot on a beach again. Netflix \n\"13th\" You know who won't be spending the holidays with their loved ones? Incarcerated people. Ava DuVernay's look at the racial inequality in the United States' prison system will make you forget all about the joyful holidays and leave you angry. MGM \n\"The Amityville Horror\" A husband becomes possessed and goes on a murderous rampage trying to kill his family? That's one way to make you feel better about not visiting your relatives this holiday season.

Open Road Films \n\"Spotlight\" We promise that this biographical film about a team of investigative journalists uncovering a sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy inside. \nOpen Road Films \n\"Rosewater\" A film about a real journalist who was really tortured and interrogated for 118 days will most certainly take you down a dark path far, far away from any memories of holiday joy and cheer. \nFrom war sagas to demonic children, there’s no holiday cheer here 1 of 13 \nYou either love the holidays or you hate them for whatever reason -- there's little in between -- and if belong to the latter camp, then here are a few of our favorite non-holiday films on Netflix to help you forget about the season.",

Earlier this month, Chapelle hosted a Saturday Night Live centralized around the election. The episode featured Chapelle and A Tribe called Quest. On the episode, they spoke on misleading headlines that stated Chapelle was endorsing Donald Trump. He quickly shut those rumors down. \nKayy: Instagram || Twitter \nThere is not a lot of information on Chapelle’s new show. We just know that it will be coming from his “personal comedy vault” and will include footage from his recent tour. Lucas Shaw tweeted, \nDave Chappelle sold Netflix 3 comedy specials, one from his most recent tour and two from his “personal comedy vault.” \nNetflix is definitely stepping their game up as they also recently announced a $40 million deal with Chris Rock. These will definitely make “Netflix and Chill” a lot more spicy!",

      "text": "Netflix hasn’t been adding as much old content as they used to, but are now focusing on original content for their streaming service. Because of this, the past few months have been brutal for us horror fans hoping for fresh additions. Thankfully, December is a strong uptick in titles, while also adding one major original title: Legendary Pictures’ Ghostbusters -esque Spectral ! I thought we’d get that in the New Year…nope, how about in a few weeks?!\n\nHere’s a full breakdown of what to expect.\nAvailable December 1st House of Wax (2006) From Jaume Collet-Serra and featuring Paris Hilton, “ A gang of college friends, including Wade (Jared Padalecki) and his girlfriend, Carly (Elisha Cuthbert), are en route to a school football game when they wind up with a flat tire in a ghost town. They are forced to seek help in the only place that’s open: the local wax museum. Once inside the spooky and seemingly abandoned building, they find the works on display are not quite what they seem — and the group soon discovers it’s being hunted by the insane twin brothers who run the museum. ”\n\nHannibal (2001) “ Seven years have passed since Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins) escaped from custody. The doctor is now at large in Europe. Mason Verger (Gary Oldman) remembers Lecter too, and is obsessed with revenge. Verger was Dr. Lecter’s sixth victim, and though horribly disfigured, has survived. Verger realizes that to draw the doctor into the open, he must use someone as bait: Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore). ”\n\nAvailable December 5th The Good Neighbor (2016) Trace caught the film at the Austin premiere, where he wrote in his review :\n‘The Waiting’ is a very strong directorial debut for Farahani, and showcases strong performances throughout… [it] packs an emotional wallop of an ending that makes the slow pace of the film worthwhile.\n“ Mysterious events occur in The Good Neighbor when two high school filmmakers decide to create the illusion of a haunting on an unsuspecting neighbor. The fun begins as the duo’s suspicions grow and, as the tension mounts, they realize too late that the man they’re manipulating is the last person they should’ve chosen for their project. ”\n\nAvailable December 6th The Devil’s Dolls (2016) “ A serial killer’s curse unleashes a season of slaughter in the backwoods of Mississippi. According to an ancient Guatemalan tradition, parents teach their children to allay their troubles by telling them to handmade “worry dolls” just before bedtime. But when several of these talismans—which once belonged to a notorious mass murderer—find their way into the hands of unsuspecting residents of a small Southern town, it sets off a grisly wave of bloodshed. ”\nDirected by Padraig Reynolds ( Rites of Spring ), the film was shot in Mississippi and was produced by Greg Haggart, Christopher Wiehl, Padraig Reynolds and Danny Kolker from an original script by Kolker and Wiehl. Executive Producers are Ted Ackerley and Greg Root.\nBrea Grant, Brandon Johnson, Ashlynn Ross, Samantha Smith, Kennedy Brice, Naomi Kyle, Yohance Myles, Christopher Wiehl, and Kym Jackson star in The Devil’s Doll .\n\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video \nAvailable December 9th Spectral—NETFLIX ORIGINAL Netflix has acquired Spectral , the Legendary Pictures-produced action sci-fi film that was pulled from its August release this summer, Deadline is reporting..\nDirected by Nic Mathieu and starring James Badge Dale ( World War Z ), Max Martini ( Pacific Rim ), Emily Mortimer ( Shutter Island ), and Bruce Greenwood ( Super 8 ), the film follows “ a special ops team who battle supernatural entities taking over a European city. ”\nThe film is being likened to Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down and Ghostbusters , only with ghosts and supernatural entities. In it, a brilliant DARPA scientist embarks on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a battle-scarred, war-torn city, where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilians deaths.\nSpectral is based on a story by Ian Fried and Mathieu, and it was scripted by George Nolfi. Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Jillian Share produced it. The film was shot primarily on location in various war-torn streets and buildings in Budapest, Hungary, relying extensively on practical effects and locations for an authentic, gritty atmosphere firmly planted in reality. The film has a score by Junkie XL ( Batman v Superman and Deadpool ). The futuristic weapons were produced by Peter Jackson’s Weta Workshop and the VFX was done by Weta Digital, overseen by Oscar winners Joe Letteri and Erik Winquist.\n\nAvailable December 13th I Am Not a Serial Killer (2016) Christopher Lloyd ( Back To The Future ), Max Records ( Where The Wild Things Are ) and Laura Fraser ( Breaking Bad ) star in the feature, “which charts the story of a teenage boy hunting for a supernatural serial killer in his snowbound mid-western town.”\n“ Sixteen-year old John Cleaver (Max Records) is dangerous, and he knows it. He’s obsessed with serial killers, but really doesn’t want to become one. Terrible impulses constantly tempt him, so for his own sake, and the safety of those around, he lives by rigid rules to keep himself “good” and “normal”. However, when a real monster shows up in his town he has to let his dark side out in order to stop it – but without his rules to keep him in check, he might be more dangerous than the monster he’s trying to kill. ”\n\nAvailable December 16th Rats (2016) Morgan Spurlock’s documentary, Rats is not for the weak stomached. \n“ Inspired by Robert Sullivan’s New York Times bestselling book, RATS goes deep beneath the surface to explore the lives of man’s greatest parasite. Oscar® nominated director Morgan Spurlock unveils a new form of documentary horror storytelling, journeying around the world to bring viewers face to face with rats while delving into our complicated relationship with these creepy creatures. ”\nPlease enable Javascript to watch this video \n\n",

      "text": "14 movies streaming on Netflix you need to watch with your S.O. during Thanksgiving break It’s Thanksgiving weekend , and whether it is long, or short, unremarkable, or even a true vacation for you, we can always count on one thing: Netflix. Because after all the turkey, the mashed potatoes, the candied yams, and even the pumpkin pie, you’re gonna want a different kind of comfort: MOVIES IN BED (or on the couch) WITH A BLANKET. And if you have a loved one to cozy up and watch movies with, you have at least one thing to be very thankful for this year. And and and! Good news: We have compiled a list of the best movies to watch snuggled up on the couch this season. You are welcome.\n1. Serendipity \nIf you have never seen this enchanted film, don’t hesitate to throw it on. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack fall in love through a series of missed opportunities and, well, serendipity. Romantic, seasonal, and streaming on Netflix right now. Get to it.\n2 . Hollidaysburg Though relatively unknown, Hollidaysburg is a great story of love, friendship, and Thanksgiving! A group of friends come together after their first stint at college and have to learn to deal with everyone’s new lives. (Relatable, good looking people, Thanksgiving — it’s perfect.)\n3 . Love Actually \nLook, I am never going to write a list about movies, or the holidays, or significant others, or friendship, or British people, or Hugh Grant, without including Love Actually. This movie has everything and everyone should watch it all of the time.\n4 . Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind It’s sad, sure, but it is poignant, beautiful, and a great conversation piece for after the movie ends. Maybe not the best to watch with your S.O., but at least you will be reminded of how lucky you are to have one another.\n5 . 2 Days in New York Chris Rock and Julie Delpy play a couple who enjoys a very peaceful life until her family comes to town. I feel like all couples can relate to this movie on some level — plus, it’s hilarious. (Chris Rock, obviously.)\n6. Moonrise Kingdom \nI am suggesting this because Life Aquatic isn’t on Netflix (for some frustrating reason and I will always be mad about) but Moonrise Kingdom is also excellent. Everyone deserves a quirky Wes Anderson break over the holidays, and this tale of romance is a very unique one.\n7 . Titanic \n¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nCome on. It’s three and a half hours of cuddling up, quoting the movie, and crying a little bit. What else would you want to watch?\n\n8 . Scrooged Because you didn’t get enough Bill Murray with Moonrise Kingdom and everyone knows their relationship and holiday vacation deserves more Bill.\n9. Coming to America \nComing to America is hilarious, nostalgic (for those of us who obsessively watched Eddie Murphy’s movie collection as children), and for some reason, really perfect for this time of year.\n10 . Dutch What a random movie suggestion, amirite? Dutch takes place at Thanksgiving and will tickle your nostalgic funny bone. Plus, it’s a John Hughes so you can count on it to entertain you both.\n11 . Forrest Gump \nThere is never a bad time to watch Forrest Gump , but snuggling up with the cold outside and a plate of leftover Thanksgiving food just makes it all the better.\n12 . Son in Law For absolutely no explicable reason, I really loved Son in Law as a kid. Pauly Shore is obnoxious but funny, Carla Gugino is beautiful and hilarious, and what better movie to watch with your S.O. than a movie about lying to your family on Thanksgiving?\n13 . 50 First Dates \nBecause Adam and Drew make a great couple, and I am assuming you and your partner do as well. (And this movie is adorable .)\n14 . Step Up At best, Step Up is just okay, but there is a reason it’s worth watching: DANCING. That and — it is pretty romantic to watch Jenna and Channing Tatum fall in love. (They’re so cute, you guys.)\nThe post 14 movies streaming on Netflix you need to watch with your S.O. during Thanksgiving break appeared first on HelloGiggles .",

      "text": "  Here’s Everything Coming And Going on Netflix In December 2016   Nice Move \nIt’s almost Thanksgiving, which means we are one step closer to December, which means we are one step closer to gaining all of our winter weight from avoiding the cold by sitting on the couch and watching TV while eating Christmas cookies. While Netflix is a bit low on the Christmas fare they are delivering this December (thank god for Freeform and Hallmark), there are definitely some things you don’t want to miss, like the new season of Fuller House , Paris Hilton attempting to act in House of Wax and Jennifer Aniston’s highly underrated Picture Perfect . \nComing to Netflix in December 2016 \nDecember 1 Angels in the Snow (2015) The Angry Birds Movie (2016) Beverly Hills Cop (1984)",

      "text": "by Sydney Gore Photo courtesy of Netflix \nThe forthcoming release of Barry on Netflix could not have come at a better time. The teaser had us excited, but the trailer shows how deep this story will go. As previously reported, Barry chronicles the life of Barack Obama while he attended college at Columbia University. \nThe film starts during Obama's junior year back in 1981, a fundamental time during which he developed a stance on race, politics, and his identity as a mixed-race American. Overall, the whole point of Barry is to outline how Obama's past led to him winning the election for President of the United States in 2008. \nAfter December 16, everything else that follows might be a bit of a blur. At least, we have Southside With You on deck too so we can pine over the charming love story of Barack and Michelle. The Obamas may be leaving the White House, but they will forever be in our hearts. \nOn a brighter note, watch the full trailer for the film, below. NYLON Video",

      "text": "Bounce Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 \nNEW YORK (AP) - Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years - a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix   3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n ",

Twitter/Gilmore Girls \n“Gilmore Girls” will not officially start streaming on Netflix until Nov. 25, but some lucky fans were able to catch the first episode premiere in Los Angeles on Friday. Almost the entire cast was present, including the three generations of Gilmore women, who gave insight on just how the series will be. \nREAD: 'Gilmore Girls' revival trailer: 'A Year in the Life' confirms everyone is back including Sookie \nKelly Bishop, who plays Emily Gilmore, told Entertainment Tonight just how her character was coping with the loss of Richard Gilmore, who was played by Edward Herrmann. “She's dealing with the new reality,” the actress said. “She is a widow and she's got to figure out her life. And she goes up and down and back and forth -- as we all do in grief.” Herrmann passed away in 2014. \nThe 72-year-old actress then went on to say that by the end of the four-part sequel, Emily finds her footing again. However, “she has a few places that she goes that are not great.\" \nAs Herrmann’s daughter, Ryan Herrmann, told The Hollywood Reporter , the team behind “Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life” did a wonderful job at honoring the deceased actor. She made it clear that the series really wrote him into the script and that his passing was not taken lightly or written off hurriedly. \nREAD: 'Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life': The cast, the timing and the feels from Netflix's revival \nAnd while the show is not even been available to the public yet, executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino has already discussed expanding the world of “Gilmore Girls.” She explained that the Netflix revival allowed her to give the characters some closure but their stories have not been set in stone. “There's no neat wrap-up in everything that we ever write, whether it's ‘Gilmore Girls’ or any other project because life is messy,\" she said. \nMost of cast was present in the premiere of “Winter,” Netflix's first episode of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" Bishop was joined by Alexis Bledel (Rory Gilmore) and Lauren Graham (Lorelai Gilmore).

      "text": "Netflix's Young Obama Series Could Suck Netflix Has A Young Barack Obama Movie Coming & Here's The Trailer November 22, 2016 , 1:00 AM Long gone are the days when Netflix original meant something new and exciting. We're not exactly sure when the tipping point hit, but our best guess is when they literally released something called Scrotal Recall , then renewed it as Lovesick . Not to say that Orange Is the New Black isn't the best show of all time, or that The Get Down isn't shocking great, but we're just not going to get our hopes up every time The Ranch trailer starts autoplaying, or there's a Kevin Smith original waiting pre-loaded into our queues. All that being said, Barack Obama origin movie Barry has piqued our interest.It has some big shoes to fill. Not only the greatest president since FDR (LBJ stans, calm down), but also one of the greatest sketches of the Key & Peele years .Newcomer Devon Terrell plays Barry as he moves to New York City, enrolls in Columbia University, and has a bunch of very significant conversations about the way our country is, or was. It looks good, in that New York City always photographs well, and Terrell has the Obama cadence down pat. The film has drawn positive reviews , but will have to navigate the treacherous waters of attempting to canonize a President's legacy before the ink has dried on his final proclamation. You can ask Oliver Stone how that went. Still, we're optimistic. Hope is all we've got left. See the trailer below. Barry debuts December 16. Advertisement",

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Scott Roth Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Home Blog The Grapevine Dave Chappelle Has Three Standup Comedy Specials Coming to Netflix Hot on the heels of his highly-rated post-election appearance on Saturday Night Live, Chappelle is ready to release both new and old material to the online network. COMMENT WASHINGTON, DC- OCTOBER 18: Actor and comedian Dave Chappelle poses on the red carpet during the 18th Annual Mark Twain Prize For Humor on October 18, 2015 in Washington, DC. Kris Connor/Getty Images \nIf Dave Chappelle’s appearance on Saturday Night Live earlier this month left you wanting more, you are in luck; the comedian has three specials coming to Netflix, the online network announced Monday. \nAs Variety reports , these projects will be Chappelle’s first standup tv specials in twelve years. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nThe deal includes one original special produced by Chappelle and director Stan Lathan. The other two specials, which will come from Chappelle’s vault, include a performance produced at the Austin City Limits Live venue and one performance at the Hollywood Palladium. \nChappelle’s appearance as the host on Saturday Night Live this month generated the show’s highest ratings in three years, and according to Variety, Chappelle is one of the most successful touring comics in the country, staging 500 shows during the last three years.

      "text": "Netflix Netflix/CBC \nCanadian actors Dalila Bela ( Diary of a Wimpy Kid, Once Upon a Time ), Corinne Koslo ( Sweeney Todd, Best in Show ) and Aymeric Jett Montaz ( Bellevue, Just for Laughs Gags! ), have joined the cast of Netflix and CBC’s Anne of Green Gables adaptation, which now has an official title, Anne. Netflix's 'Anne of Green Gables' Adaptation Finds Its Anne Shirley, Casts 2 Other Roles \nThe eight-episode drama series is a coming-of-age story about an outsider who, against all odds and numerous challenges, fights for love and acceptance and her place in the world. The series centers on a young orphaned girl in the late 1890s who, after an abusive childhood spent in orphanages and the homes of strangers, mistakenly is sent to live with an aging sister and brother, Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert. Over time, 13-year-old Anne will transform their lives and eventually the entire small town in which they live with her unique spirit, fierce intellect and brilliant imagination. \nBela’s Diana Barry is Anne’s loyal friend and kindred spirit. Koslo’s Rachel Lynde is Avonlea’s resident gossip. Montaz will play Jerry Baynard, a hired farmhand mentioned in passing in the novel who now features prominently in the new series. They join previously announced Amybeth McNulty, who stars as as Anne Shirley, Geraldine James OBE and R.H. Thomson as Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert, and Lucas Jade Zumann as Gilbert Blythe. \nAnne is executive produced by Moira Walley-Beckett and Miranda de Pencier under her Northwood Entertainment banner. Walley-Beckett is penning the first season and serves as showrunner. The show is slated to premiere in 2017 on CBC in Canada and globally, outside of Canada, on Netflix. ",

      "text": "14 movies streaming on Netflix you need to watch with your S.O. during Thanksgiving break jessica tholmer More It’s Thanksgiving weekend , and whether it is long, or short, unremarkable, or even a true vacation for you, we can always count on one thing: Netflix. Because after all the turkey, the mashed potatoes, the candied yams, and even the pumpkin pie, you’re gonna want a different kind of comfort: MOVIES IN BED (or on the couch) WITH A BLANKET. And if you have a loved one to cozy up and watch movies with, you have at least one thing to be very thankful for this year. And and and! Good news: We have compiled a list of the best movies to watch snuggled up on the couch this season. You are welcome. 1. Serendipity If you have never seen this enchanted film, don’t hesitate to throw it on. Kate Beckinsale and John Cusack fall in love through a series of missed opportunities and, well, serendipity. Romantic, seasonal, and streaming on Netflix right now. Get to it. 2 . Hollidaysburg Though relatively unknown, Hollidaysburg is a great story of love, friendship, and Thanksgiving! A group of friends come together after their first stint at college and have to learn to deal with everyone’s new lives. (Relatable, good looking people, Thanksgiving — it’s perfect.) 3 . Love Actually Look, I am never going to write a list about movies, or the holidays, or significant others, or friendship, or British people, or Hugh Grant, without including Love Actually. This movie has everything and everyone should watch it all of the time. 4 . Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind It’s sad, sure, but it is poignant, beautiful, and a great conversation piece for after the movie ends. Maybe not the best to watch with your S.O., but at least you will be reminded of how lucky you are to have one another. 5 . 2 Days in New York Chris Rock and Julie Delpy play a couple who enjoys a very peaceful life until her family comes to town. I feel like all couples can relate to this movie on some level — plus, it’s hilarious. (Chris Rock, obviously.) 6. Moonrise Kingdom I am suggesting this because Life Aquatic isn’t on Netflix (for some frustrating reason and I will always be mad about) but Moonrise Kingdom is also excellent. Everyone deserves a quirky Wes Anderson break over the holidays, and this tale of romance is a very unique one. 7 . Titanic ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ Come on. It’s three and a half hours of cuddling up, quoting the movie, and crying a little bit. What else would you want to watch? 8 . Scrooged Because you didn’t get enough Bill Murray with Moonrise Kingdom and everyone knows their relationship and holiday vacation deserves more Bill. 9. Coming to America Coming to America is hilarious, nostalgic (for those of us who obsessively watched Eddie Murphy’s movie collection as children), and for some reason, really perfect for this time of year. 10 . Dutch What a random movie suggestion, amirite? Dutch takes place at Thanksgiving and will tickle your nostalgic funny bone. Plus, it’s a John Hughes so you can count on it to entertain you both. 11 . Forrest Gump There is never a bad time to watch Forrest Gump , but snuggling up with the cold outside and a plate of leftover Thanksgiving food just makes it all the better. 12 . Son in Law For absolutely no explicable reason, I really loved Son in Law as a kid. Pauly Shore is obnoxious but funny, Carla Gugino is beautiful and hilarious, and what better movie to watch with your S.O. than a movie about lying to your family on Thanksgiving? 13 . 50 First Dates Because Adam and Drew make a great couple, and I am assuming you and your partner do as well. (And this movie is adorable .) 14 . Step Up At best, Step Up is just okay, but there is a reason it’s worth watching: DANCING. That and — it is pretty romantic to watch Jenna and Channing Tatum fall in love. (They’re so cute, you guys.)",

      "text": "11 Movies to Watch on Netflix If You Hate the Holidays (Photos) More Here are a few of our favorite non-holiday films on Netflix to help you forget about this horrible season. You either love the holidays or you hate them–there’s no in between–and if you’ve found yourself here then we already know what camp you belong to. “Black Hawk Down” Any war movie will make you forget about the holidays and be thankful for simply being alive–and this war movie is actually good. “Armaggedon” What better way to avoid the holidays than if Earth as we know it was about to end? For a two and a half hours, you can experience the same fantasy. “The 13th” You know who won’t be spending the holidays with their loved ones? Incarcerated people. Ava DuVernay’s look at the racial inequality in the United States’ prison system will make you forget all about the joyful holidays. “The Amityville Horror” A husband becomes possessed and goes on a murderous rampage trying to kill his family? That’s one way to make you feel better about not visiting your family this holiday season. “Mean Girls” What better way to forget about the holidays than to recall every mean and traumatizing thing that happened to you during high school? “Stephen King’s Children of the Corn” We know you hate the holidays because you secretly hate being around all those rowdy kids. It’s OK though because “Children of the Corn” gives you good reason to fear kids. “Rosewater” A film about a real journalist who was really tortured and interrogated for 118 days will most certainly take you down a dark path far, far away from any memories of holiday joy and cheer. “Spotlight” We promise that this biographical film about a team of investigative journalists uncovering a sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church will not leave you feeling warm and bubbly inside. “Jaws” Here’s one movie that won’t leave you feeling eager to cuddle up with a loved one or missing your family. On the contrary, it’ll probably leave you scarred for life and fearful of ever stepping foot on a beach again. Reblog",

Show runner Amy Sherman-Palladino revealed to Entertainment Weekly that former cast member Edward Hermann’s death (who played Grandpa Richard Gilmore) fuels most of the new revival. She explained: \nDealing with the death of Richard is going to impact all of them, because when somebody close to you dies your whole life comes into a weird focus for a minute.\nOn one afternoon while filming, the lights inexplicably went out on set and cast member Kelly Bishop told Entertainment Weekly she felt Hermann’s spirit, stating that: \nI said, ‘Ed was that you?’ Lauren said, ‘It was Ed.’ I just feel like he’s here. Besides the script and the way we all feel about him, the giant portrait is all calling him to come to the set. \nActress Lauren Graham (who plays Richard’s daughter Lorelai) added: \nThis is an emotional experience. It has the loss of a person I love around it. I went to dinner with Ed frequently. It was a real loss of a friend.\nGet more details on the Gilmore Girls revival series, when the show will premiere and more below.\nPREMIERE DATE: November 25, 2016\nRELEASE TIME: 3 a.m. Eastern time and midnight Pacific time EPISODE TITLES: \n1 – “Winter”\n2 – “Spring”\n3 – “Summer”\n4 – “Fall” CAST: \nLauren Graham as Lorelai Gilmore\nAlexis Bledel as Rory Gilmore\nScott Patterson as Luke Danes\nKeiko Agena as Lane Kim\nYanic Truesdale as Michel Gerard\nMilo Ventimiglia as Jess Mariano\nSean Gunn as Kirk Gleason\nMatt Czuchry as Logan Huntzberger\nKelly Bishop as Emily Gilmore\nMelissa McCarthy as Sookie St. James\nLiza Weil as Paris Geller\nJared Padalecki as Dean Forester\nChris Eigeman as Jason Stiles\nVanessa Marano as April Nardini\nRose Abdoo as Gypsy\nDavid Sutcliffe as Christopher Hayden\nMichael Winters as Taylor Doose\nLiz Torres as Miss Patty\nEmily Kuroda as Mrs. Kim\nJackson Douglas as Jackson Belleville\nSally Struthers as Babette Dell WRITERS & DIRECTORS: Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino (Netflix)\nGilmore Girls Reunion at ATX Festival 2015: The Photos You Need to See Tonight was the Gilmore Girls reunion at the 2015 ATX Festival.

READ: Twitter’s #ThankYouObama Shows Heartfelt Gratitude To POTUS \nDebuted by The Huffington Post on Monday (Nov. 21), the film will take a look into Obama’s journey at Columbia University, including his brush with police brutality and uncovering his black identity. Played by Devon Terrell, the actor helps evoke the emotion and discovery of the future president, from his love of hip-hop music to the ups and downs of college life. \nHitting the streaming service Nov. 16, director Vikram Gandhi linked up with Columbia alumni Dam Mansbach, who penned the script. Gandhi’s other works include the Vice documentary series and Kumaré , a film about a man impersonates a wise Indian Guru in Arizona. \nCheck out the promising trailer below.",

      "text": "Above: CEO of Amazon.com Jeff Bezos Image Credit: Tomasso Boddi AFP/Getty Images \nThe e-commerce giant is looking to acquire the rights to a broad range of sporting events. \nIt’s only been a few days since the news broke that Amazon is rolling out its Prime Video streaming service in more than 200 countries to go head-to-head with Netflix . And now the e-commerce giant is said to be looking at putting together a premium sports package to go with it. \nThe company has been in talks with a wide range of different sports leagues about acquiring broadcasting rights, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal . \nObviously, Amazon would probably be most interested in the top National Basketball Association, Major League Baseball, and National Football League events, but it is also talking to the National Lacrosse League and the World Surf League, the newspaper’s sources said. \nThe big problem with trying to buy up basketball, football, and baseball programming is that the major networks—especially ESPN—have already locked up most of them for the next decade or so. \nFor example, the deal that ESPN has with the NBA doesn’t end until 2024, and the rights packages that ESPN, CBS and NBC have for National Football League games run into the next decade as well. Even college football teams have locked up rights with various cable networks. \nESPN’s parent Disney is also looking to expand its streaming offerings, including a new service that is expected to be launched soon. That’s why the entertainment giant recently spent $1 billion to buy a stake in BAMTech, the tech provider that handles streaming for Major League Baseball and a number of other clients including ESPN. \nAccording to the Journal , Amazon is “keenly aware” that the NFL Sunday Ticket games offered by DirecTV helped give that cable competitor a boost when it first launched, and therefore Amazon wants to do something similar by signing up whatever sports it can. \nAs with almost everything Amazon does, the content in this case is just a lure to get customers to sign up for its Prime subscription service, which generates significant returns for the company and now incorporates everything from free shipping on products to a Spotify-style music service. \nThere’s one big reason why we shouldn’t dismiss either the online giant’s sports ambitions or its global Netflix competitor: Namely, Amazon’s $380 billion market capitalization, and the massive river of cash that spins out of its Amazon Web Services division, where hundreds of Fortune 500 companies store their data. It generates about $10 billion in revenue every year. \nThat’s definitely enough to spend buying up sporting rights. All Amazon has to do is find someone who is willing to sell and who hasn’t already cut a deal with an existing network. \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com . Copyright 2016",

      "text": "November 21, 2016 at 3:32 pm | UPDATED: November 21, 2016 at 3:41 pm \nTop of the Order: \nGiving Thanks Early: With Thanksgiving coming up in a few days, it’s that time of year when everyone typically spends a moment or two of reflection by pondering about the things they are thankful for. And then they gorge on as much food as they can possibly push down their gullet, most likely within 15 minutes so that they don’t have to miss too much of whatever football games are on television Thursday afternoon. \nThis year’s Thanksgiving gorging began early: On Monday the nation’s investors chewed up the stock market so much that all the major stock indexes ended the day at their highest closing points ever. \nThe tech-focused Nasdaq Composite Index rose almost 1 percent to finish as 5,368.86, the blue chip Dow Jones industrial average climbed 0.5 percent to 18,956.69, and the broad-based Standard & Poor’s 500 Index rose 0.8 percent to end the day’s trading at 2,198.18. \nAmong the Bay Area’s big-name companies, gains came from Apple, Facebook, Alphabet, eBay and Intel. \nStocks, on the whole, have been in rally mode since the Nov. 8 election of Donald Trump as president. The latest gains also have been fueled by rising prices of oil ahead of an OPEC meeting set for Nov. 30, and the possibility that Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen will announce an interest rate hike next month. \nThat’s a lot to digest, economy-wise, in the next few weeks. But if we know anything at all about Thanksgiving, it’s that we always seem to find room for seconds. And with the stock market surging like it has been lately, it looks like investors can’t fill their plates fast enough. \nMiddle Innings: \nWill “Rick James” show up? For more than a decade, Dave Chappelle has been one of the top comedians in the U.S. And while his landmark series “Chappelle’s Show” has been off the air since the third “season” of the program ran in the summer of 2006, no one who saw the show during its original run will ever forget skits like “Charlie Murphy’s True Hollywood Stories,” which included Chappelle’s famous imitations of Prince and musician Rick James , nor the time Chappelle went for a late-night ride and learned of the very dark side of comedian Wayne Brady . \nSince then, Chappelle has kept a mostly low profile, sometimes appearing in late-night, announced-at-the-last-minute shows in comedy spots such as San Francisco’s Cobb’s Comedy Club. But with his hosting “Saturday Night Live” on Nov. 12, and his now-famous take on Trump’s election and its aftermath, Chappelle appeared to be making a new play for a space in the public consciousness. \nWell, that space is about to get even more public. \nOn Monday, Netflix said it has signed Chappelle up for three “all-new stand-up specials” for the online TV network. One of the three specials is slated to be a stand-up performance of all-new material, while the other two sound like they are shows that Chappelle has already completed. Those two include performances Chappelle gave at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium that, according to Netflix, “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault.” \nNetflix said the new Chappelle shows will be released simultaneously in 2017 but didn’t give an exact date for the premieres. With Chappelle’s history of announcing his gigs at the last minute, holding off on telling us when his new program will appear should come as no surprise to anyone. \nBottom of the Lineup: \nHere’s a look at how some leading Silicon Valley stocks did Monday … \nMovin’ on Up: Gains came from Applied Micro Circuits, Arista Networks, Glu Mobile, Coupa Software and Silver Spring Networks. \nIn the Red: Decliners included Oclaro, NeoPhotonics, Nektar Therapeutics, SunPower and Quotient Technology. \nQuote of the Day: “We’re not good enough to throw it every down.”— San Francisco 49ers head coach Chip Kelly, speaking after the Niners on Sunday lost to New England , 30-17. It was San Francisco’s ninth loss in a row. \nSign up for the 60-Second Business Break newsletter at www.siliconvalley.com . Tags: ",

Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years. A trio of specials will be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. Invision Photo by Scott Roth i Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nComedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"\"Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Heatherly Bell and HEA know that as soon as Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life arrives on Friday, we’ll binge our way through it in no time. And then what will we do? Heatherly, whose contemporary romance Breaking Emily’s Rules arrives Feb. 1, answers that question with some book recommendations that can help in the aftermath.\nHeatherly: I first came upon the long-running Gilmore Girls in 2005 when I stumbled across a rerun. The show immediately pulled me in because of the eccentric characters (Kirk … looking at you), the intelligent and snappy banter and the humor with heart.\nI caught newer episodes faithfully every week night, purchased all the DVDs (remember the days before Netflix?) and watched all I’d missed to date. And then, to the detriment of all mankind, the show went off the air in 2007!\nMany of us die-hard Gilmorites can’t wait to catch up with Lorelai, Luke, Rory and the rest on Netflix!\nKelly Bishop, left, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. (Photo: Netflix)\nBut after this latest Netflix showing, who knows when we might see the gang again? If you’re like me, you can find some solace in light-hearted romance. In the style of the charming fictional town of Stars Hollow, Connecticut, I’ve compiled a list of contemporary romance books with the same wonderful small-town feel. Open up the pages of these books and be drawn into their unique and quirky world. Some were even directly inspired by Gilmore Girls . Following are my top recommendations, in no particular order.\nLucky Harbor series by Jill Shalvis. Gilmore Girls if Miss Patty wore track suits and had blue hair. Lucille, resident senior citizen troublemaker, appears in all 12 books of this series set near the Olympic Mountains in Washington. But in One in a Million , Lucille plays matchmaker to her granddaughter. And we know that Miss Patty thought of Lorelai Gilmore as her grand … ahem, her daughter.\nMisfit Brides series by Jamie Farrell. The Misfit Brides series is set in Bliss, Illinois, which is like a bridal-obsessed Midwestern version of Stars Hollow. If you love Sookie St. James, you’ll adore Kimmie, the resident baker in Bliss. The only thing that can ruffle her in the kitchen is seeing sugar used improperly. Check out Sugared from the Misfit Brides series and prepare to be Gilmored!\nLauren Graham as Lorelei and Scott Patterson as Luke in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. (Photo: Netflix)\nClover Park series by Kylie Gilmore. If you love Stars Hollow, you’ll enjoy a visit to Clover Park. Start with The Opposite of Wild . Taylor’s Olde Fashioned Soda Shoppe may have found its competition in the Dancing Cow Fro Yo shop with an actual dancing cow! (Is that Kirk in a cow costume?) Check out the downtown for books! Coffee! A real gazebo! Fast talking! Kisses! Twinkle lights!\nHopes Falls series by Melanie Shawn. When you’re missing Stars Hollow, you might want to try visiting Hope Falls. In Sweet Reunion, Amanda has just inherited Mountain Ridge Outdoor Adventures. Think The Dragonfly Inn if it also had kayaking and zip-lining.\nPage Turners series by Jennie Marts. The romantic comedies of the Page Turners series are the perfect solution to getting your GG fix. Based on an intergenerational book club, it has the clever wit of Lorelai, a snarky teenager like Rory and a spunky geriatric Nancy Drew who has the sass of Emily and the dirty mind of Miss Patty. Try Another Saturday Night and I Ain’t Got No Body for a Gilmore -inspired mystery.\nEmily Kuroda as Mrs. Kim, Keiko Agena as Lane and Alexis Bledel as Rory in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. (Photo: Netflix)\nSt. Helena’s Vineyard series by Marina Adair. Now imagine Gilmore Girls if it were set in the picturesque California vineyard setting of St. Helena. You’ve got Autumn in the Vineyard , recently made into a Hallmark movie. Frankie Baudouin and Nate DeLuca are a love-struck couple with a mother who strongly disapproves. Paging Lorelai and Luke!\nLast Chance series by Hope Ramsay. For a little bit of Stars Hollow with a Southern twist, try Welcome to Last Chance .

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 NEW YORK (AP) -- British and German TV productions each won three International Emmys Monday night, including acting honors for Dustin Hoffman and Christiane Paul. The centerpiece of the awards ceremony at the Hilton New York came when Tony Goldwyn, who stars as President Fitzgerald Grant in the Washington drama \"Scandal,\" presented the honorary International Emmy Founders Award to the show's creator, producer and writer Shonda Rhimes, who also brought such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder\" to the small screen. Hoffman received the award for best performance by an actor for the BBC One TV movie \"Roald Dahl's Esio Trot.\" The Oscar-winning actor portrayed a lonely retired bachelor who hatches an audacious plan to woo the widow in the flat below who is overly fond of her pet tortoise. Germany's Paul garnered the best actress award for her performance in \"Untern Radar\" (\"Under the Radar\") as a judge whose life is upended when her daughter is suspected of being responsible for a bombing in Berlin. A total of 40 nominees from 15 countries competed in 10 categories for International Emmys, which honor excellence in TV programming outside the U.S. The ceremony was hosted by \"The Good Wife\" star Alan Cumming. Britain's \"Hoff the Record,\" with former \"Baywatch\" star David Hasselhoff playing a fictionalized, over-the-top version of himself, won in the comedy category. \"Capital,\" about residents of a South London suburb whose lives are impacted when their homes become valued at several million pounds in a soaring property market, won the award for TV movie/mini-series. Germany also won Emmys for drama series for \"Deutschland 83,\" the story of an East German spy who infiltrates the West German army to steal NATO secrets. The award in the documentary category went to \"Krieg der Lugen\" (\"War of Lies\"), about an Iraqi refugee whose information about weapons of mass destruction passed through Western intelligence agencies and ultimately was used by the U.S. to help justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The award for arts programming went to Japan's \"The Man Who Shot Hiroshima,\" which looks at Hollywood cinematographer Harry Mimura who returned to his native Japan before World War II and later was hired by the U.S. government to shoot footage of life in the Japanese city months after it was devastated by an atomic bomb. Sweden's \"Allt for Sverige\" (\"The Great Swedish Adventure\") received the award for non-scripted entertainment. The reality TV show featured Swedish-Americans returning to the land of their roots for the first time to compete in events connected to Swedish traditions. Other awards went to Brazil's \"Verdades Secretas\" (\"Hidden Truths\") for best telenovela, and to \"Francisco, El Jesuita\" (\"Francis, the Jesuit\"), the story of the man who became the first pope from Latin America, for non-English language, U.S. primetime program. Danish actress Birgitte Hjort Sorensen presented the honorary International Emmy Directorate Award to Maria Rorbye Ronn, chief executive officer and director general of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, who pioneered the success of Nordic Noir drama around the world.",

Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years. A trio of specials will be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. Invision Photo by Scott Roth i Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nComedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"\"Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Netflix releases new trailer for young Barack Obama biopic Barry   Amie Cranswick Leave a Comment \nWith a little under a month to go before its premieres on Netflix, the streaming service has released a new trailer for the upcoming biographical drama Barry . The film focuses on Barack Obama’s experiences during his junior year at Columbia University and sees Devon Terrell in the titular role; take a look below after the official synopsis… \nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. \nBarry will arrive on Netflix on December 16th and features a cast that also includes Anya Taylor-Joy ( The Witch ), Jason Mitchell ( Straight Outta Compton ), Ellar Coltrane ( Boyhood ), Ashley Judd ( Divergent ) and Jenna Elfman ( Friends with Benefits ).

      "text": "Comedian Dave Chappelle gets 3 Netflix specials (Photo: CNN) NEW YORK — Welcome back to the masses Dave Chappelle. \nFresh off a successful gig hosting “Saturday Night Live,” the beloved comic is getting three specials on Netflix. \nOn Monday, the streaming giant announced that Chappelle and director Stan Lathan have teamed up to produce a new stand-up comedy special exclusively for Netflix. \nThey’ll also partner to release two unseen concert specials from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault. Those shows — filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium — will debut simultaneously in 2017. \nChappelle, who in 2005 famously walked away from a lucrative contract and the third season of his popular Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” spent several years making impromptu appearances at comedy venues before returning to stand-up more regularly in 2013. \nAccording to Netflix, Chappelle has performed in more the 500 shows in the past three years — with tickets typically selling out in minutes. \nThe Chappelle news comes on the heels of Netflix mega deal with Chris Rock to produce two new stand-up streaming specials.

      "text": "  \nGet ready to see more of Dave Chappelle on Netflix! \nVariety reports that Chappelle just inked a new deal with the online streaming service for three new comedy specials. \nThe news is bound to go over well with stand-up comedy fans — especially considering that Chappelle’s three-special deal will mark the comedian’s first TV special in over a decade. \nChappelle’s new deal will include one original special produced exclusively for Netflix by Chappelle himself, and director Stan Lathan. The other two specials are unreleased projects from Chappelle’s past appearance at Austin City Limits, and the Hollywood Palladium. \nIn a statement announcing the new partnership, Netflix’s VP of original documentary and comedy, Lisa Nishimura, said they expect Chappelle’s specials to be “some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy— searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Nishimura of the famed comedian. \nCurrently, Netflix has no firm release dates set for any of Chappelle’s upcoming specials, but fans can expect to see Chappelle’s previously shot material from Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium to roll out sometime next year. \nAre you excited to tune in to Dave Chappelle’s new specials on Netflix? Let us know in the comments below!",

But it’s just one of nearly 100 new titles coming to the streaming service next month—which means it’s time to say goodbye to dozens of titles, too. Here’s everything that’s leaving Netflix in December. (Consider yourselves warned, Top Gun fans.) \nDecember 1",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix   3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

There's that feeling that it's too soon, that we don't have enough distance to properly give the subject the consideration that it deserves in a manner that isn't just a comment on the immediate popular sentiment. There's value in that, but it's also a quick way to make a movie that feels very dated very quickly. EDITOR’S PICK How Do You Prepare to Play Barack Obama in a Movie? \nNetflix's Barry looks like it wants to sidestep that by not focusing on Barack Obama, politician, but on Barry, the young guy who went to Columbia University in 1981 for his junior year, dealing with racism, parties, and identity as the son of parents from Kenya and Kansas. It's a bit similar in that regard to this year's other Obama biopic, Southside With You which also chose to avoid the White House and focus on Barack and Michelle's first date. \nStar Devon Terrell, who spoke to GQ earlier this year about how he prepared to play the president, displays an uncanny talent for mirroring the future President's verbal tics and intonations while also appearing to be a likable lead. \n\"It was about finding the awkwardness. The man we see now has a swagger about him, walks around with his chest up high,\" Terrell said. \"At 21, when he's trying to find himself, he's not as assured.\" \nBarry looks earnest and moving and worth checking out, but it's also a bittersweet reminder that our current President only has roughly two months left in office, and then we'll have to brace for what's next . Barry drops on Netflix on December 16.",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 3:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 6:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \n ",

For a two and a half hours, you can experience the same fantasy.\nvar googletag = googletag || {}; googletag.cmd = googletag.cmd || []; googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.defineOutOfPageSlot('/30981161/TheWrapRemnantOOP', 'div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0').addService(googletag.pubads()); googletag.pubads().enableSingleRequest(); googletag.enableServices(); }); googletag.cmd.push(function() { googletag.display('div-gpt-ad-1470167200293-0'); }); “The 13th” \nYou know who won’t be spending the holidays with their loved ones? Incarcerated people. Ava DuVernay’s look at the racial inequality in the United States’ prison system will make you forget all about the joyful holidays.\n“The Amityville Horror” \nA husband becomes possessed and goes on a murderous rampage trying to kill his family? That’s one way to make you feel better about not visiting your family this holiday season.\n“Mean Girls” \nWhat better way to forget about the holidays than to recall every mean and traumatizing thing that happened to you during high school?\n“Stephen King’s Children of the Corn” \nWe know you hate the holidays because you secretly hate being around all those rowdy kids. It’s OK though because “Children of the Corn” gives you good reason to fear kids.\n“Rosewater” \nA film about a real journalist who was really tortured and interrogated for 118 days will most certainly take you down a dark path far, far away from any memories of holiday joy and cheer.\n“Spotlight” \nWe promise that this biographical film about a team of investigative journalists uncovering a sexual abuse scandal within the Catholic Church will not leave you feeling warm and bubbly inside.\n“Jaws” \nHere’s one movie that won’t leave you feeling eager to cuddle up with a loved one or missing your family.\nOn the contrary, it’ll probably leave you scarred for life and fearful of ever stepping foot on a beach again.\nRead original story 11 Movies to Watch on Netflix If You Hate the Holidays (Photos) At TheWrap",

      "text": "Comments The comedian is headed to the streaming giant with three new stand-up comedy specials. \nNetflix has announced the return of Dave Chappelle with three stand-up specials in 2017. One of them is an all-new special produced by Netflix. The other two are from Chapelle's personal vault, which were previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live in April 2015 and at The Hollywood Palladium in March of this year. \"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy - searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of original documentary and comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.\" The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Chappelle, 43, has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series \"Chappelle's Show\" in 2005. The actor returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years. However, he hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on \" Saturday Night Live \" after the election earlier this month. The comedian's appearance on the show reportedly helped the episode get the highest ratings of the season so far. News: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon. pic.twitter.com/OzrDukBPk6 — Netflix US (@netflix) 21 November 2016 Chappelle becomes the latest big-name comic to sign a deal with Netflix, as Chris Rock also signed on for two specials with Netflix earlier this month, the first of which will be taped next year. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on \"Saturday Night Live\" on November 12. \n© AceShowbiz.com",

      "text": "It’s close to that time when pundits reflect on President Barack Obama’s legacy and several documentaries & biopics will be released. Netflix has released the official trailer for its upcoming biopic, Barry .\nThe highly-anticipated film will not be a political thriller detailing Obama’s most dramatic and triumphant moments in the White House. Instead, the feature film will focus on Obama as a junior at Columbia University, before he was a political figure and the charismatic leader we have grown to adore.\n\nBarry takes places in 1981 and follows Obama’s critical year at the Ivy League university. The future president battles racism, the college social scene, and struggles with his identity as a biracial man. The trailer even shows a white Columbia security guard demanding to see the new black student’s I.D. Hmm, doesn’t that sound familiar ?\nAustralian newcomer Devon Terrell recently revealed to GQ magazine how he was able to master Obama’s mannerism and speech.\n“It was about finding the awkwardness. The man we see now has a swagger about him, walks around with his chest up high. At 21, when he’s trying to find himself, he’s not as assured.”\nBarry received critical praise when it premiered at the 2016 Toronto Film Festival. It was directed by Vikram Gandhi and written by Adam Mansbach, both fellow Columbia University alums.\nBarry will begin streaming on Netflix December 16th.\nNetflix Releases Official Trailer for Highly-Anticipated Young Barack Obama Biopic, “Barry” is a post from: Gossip On This - Pop Culture, News, Videos & Humor \n",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 Share on Facebook Print By: Staff The Associated Press Published on NEW YORK — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. No exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. Chappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. Editors' Picks ",

      "text": "Loading... \n\n\nThe days of having to tune in live or buy expensive discs in order to watch your favorite shows and movies are gone. Online streaming makes it possible to watch everything from live news and sports to classic movies to modern TV favorites on your own time, and on any device you choose. \nThere are a ton of streaming services out there, and no two are alike. YouTube is probably the best place to start, but there's a whole Web full of content beyond the ubiquitous streaming site, ranging from movies to TV shows to music videos and more. To help you get the most out of your smart TV, game console, set-top box, tablet, smartphone or computer, Tom's Guide has broken down our favorite streaming media services. Whatever you like to watch, there's a service with your tastes in mind, and in your price range.\nStreaming Service\nBest For\nStarting Price\nNetflix \nOverall\n$9 per month\nHulu \nNetwork TV\n$8 per month\nAmazon Instant Video \nFamilies\n$99 per year or $7.99 per month\nSling Orange \nCable TV Replacement\n$20 per month\nPlaystation Vue \nPlaystation Owner\n$50 per month\nCrackle \nVegging Out\nFree\nFunny or Die \nComedy Fans\nFree\nTwitch \nGamers\nFree\nVevo \nMusic Fans\nFree\n\nNetflix: Best Overall Streaming Service Netflix The good Excellent selection Optimized interface Good recommendation system The bad More expensive than other services Titles come and go frequently Limited brand-new content Verdict The great-granddaddy of streaming services remains the best. As you probably know, Netflix provides unlimited streaming of TV shows, movies, comedy specials and original programming (including Orange Is the New Black, House of Cards and the fourth season of Arrested Development) for one monthly subscription fee. No other service has yet given Netflix an honest-to-goodness run for its money in terms of selection, quality and performance consistency. You can even create up to five different profiles on a single account to make sure that your favorite content doesn't mess up recommendations for your friends and loved ones. \n$9/month Netflix \nMORE: Best Shows to Watch on Netflix Now \n\n\nHulu: Best Streaming Service for Network TV Hulu The good Great selection of current TV Inexpensive Quality original programming The bad Frequent commercials Subpar movie selection Cumbersome interface Verdict If you want to keep current with the latest TV shows but don't feel like investing in a cable subscription or an HD antenna, Hulu is the best solution. This service provides access to most major network shows (aside from CBS' programs) and a handful of cable shows the day after they air. It also lets subscribers access a show's current season — or often all of the program's seasons. In addition, the service hosts a number of original shows (including joint ventures with the BBC, like The Wrong Mans and season 4 of The Thick of It), a selection of offbeat movies and a surprising amount of classic anime series. Even with a paid subscription, you have to sit through commercials, but far fewer than if you watched the same shows on cable. \n$8/month Hulu \nMORE: Best Shows to Watch on Hulu Plus Right Now \nAmazon Prime Instant Video: Best Streaming Service for Families Amazon Prime Instant Video The good Wide content selection Included with other Prime benefits Good original shows The bad Rarely gets brand-new videos Annual subscription only (no monthly option) A la carte content costs extra Verdict For those who do most of their shopping online, Amazon Prime is a no-brainer. For $99 per year, you get free two-day shipping on your purchases, a free Kindle book each month, and unlimited access to both Amazon Music and Amazon Prime Instant Video. Like Netflix, Amazon Prime Instant Video is a veritable buffet of movies, television and original programming, like Alpha House, Transparent and Mozart in the Jungle. Thanks to a deal with Viacom — which controls Comedy Central, MTV and Nickelodeon — Amazon Prime arguably has a better selection of comedy and children's programming than its competitors. The service also offers unlimited access to an extensive collection from HBO's back catalog of classics such as The Sopranos and The Wire. The separate Amazon Instant Video provides easy access to current movies, but it's an à la carte service. \n$99/year Amazon \nMORE: Best Shows to Watch on Amazon Prime Instant Video Now \nSling.TV: Best Cable TV Replacement Sling Orange The good Much cheaper than cable Wide breadth of content No contract required The bad More expensive than most streaming services Limited on-demand content (and none for ESPN) Can watch on only one device at a time Verdict If you like the idea of a cable subscription but feel it's just too expensive and offers more content than you want, Sling Orange might provide a happy medium for you. On paper, Sling sounds a lot like a traditional cable service: Pay a monthly subscription fee in exchange for about a dozen real-time channels. But there's no contract and no set-top box rental fee. Sling is especially handy for sports fans, as it offers both ESPN and ESPN2 and is the only place to watch ESPN without cable or satellite TV. For cord-cutting sports fans, this alone is worth the price. Other popular networks, like NBC, BBC America, CNN, Cartoon Network, TBS and the Food Network, sweeten the deal. If you sign up for Sling Blue, which is the services multi-stream option, and bundle it with Orange the combo will cost you $40 per month. \n$20/month Sling.TV \nPlayStation Vue: Best for PlayStation Owners PlayStation Vue The good Huge channel selection No contracts Strong DVR capabilities The bad Not compatible with many devices About as expensive as cable Not available in most areas Verdict PlayStation Vue is about as close as you can get to a cable subscription without actually getting a cable company involved. The service, which is available on PlayStation consoles, Sony smart TVs and iPads, is Sony's first foray into delivering live TV to its customers. Choose from three different packages: Access ($40 per month), which gives you basic channels, Core ($55 per month), which adds sports, Elite ($65 per month), which adds niche programming and Ultra ($75 per month), which adds certain premium channels. Although the service is expensive, it provides up to 90 live channels - including local sports and news - and lets you record your favorite shows. \n$40/month PlayStation Store \nMORE: PlayStation Vue Online TV Review: Smarter than Cable \nCrackle: Best Streaming Service for Vegging Out Crackle The good Free Amusing content Good variety of videos The bad Lots of commercials Content skews cheesy Videos rotate very frequently Verdict If you yearn for the halcyon days of cheesy action movies and anime on afternoon cable, Crackle will take you back in time at no cost. The Sony-owned platform broadcasts movies, TV shows and original programming on a rotating basis. There's no subscription or à la carte fee, although you do have to sit through a fair amount of commercials. While the programming is not usually blockbuster material, it's stuff you've heard of — think Total Recall rather than The Terminator, or Pitch Black rather than Riddick. Some of the original shows are good, too, like Jerry Seinfeld's Comedians in Cars Getting Coffee. \nFree on Crackle \nMORE: The Best Online-Original TV Shows \n\nFunny or Die: Best Streaming Service for Comedy Fans Funny or Die The good Hilarious videos Costs nothing Great celebrity cameos The bad Nothing of substance to watch Irregular updates Not available on many streaming devices Verdict Funny or Die started life as a platform for sharing chuckle-worthy videos online, but in the last few years, it's expanded to become one of the premier comedy sites on the Web. Funny or Die hosts one-off videos, ongoing series and a rotating cast of celebrity guest stars, from Bill Nye to Jennifer Lawrence to Samuel L. Jackson. With offbeat hits like Drunk History and Gay of Thrones (a decidedly LGBT-friendly take on the popular George R.R. Martin mythos), Funny or Die will not fuel your latest streaming marathon session, but it might have you in stitches a few times per day. \nFree on Funny or Die \nTwitch: Best Streaming Service for Gamers Twitch in Best Streaming Video Services 2016 The good Free to watch or stream Huge variety of games Real-time interaction with hosts The bad Relatively few quality streams Difficult to navigate Community can be unpleasant Verdict Back in the day, watching video games was reserved for the unfortunate player without his or her own controller, but now it's a pastime on par with gaming itself. Twitch is the most popular game-broadcasting service out there, and you can find thousands of streams at any given time. Whether you want to watch live eSports broadcasts of League of Legends or casual playthroughs of single-player adventures, Twitch should be your first stop. You can even find gaming talk shows with expert commentators, and follow famous Let's Play personalities as they game in real time. \nFree on Twitch \nVevo: Best Streaming Service for Music Fans Vevo The good Great selection Free to watch anything Only dedicated music video service The bad Not many long-form videos Mostly hip-hop and pop Navigation isn’t great Verdict MTV gave up on music videos years ago, but that doesn't mean the days of music videos, filmed concerts and band documentaries are gone forever. Vevo is every bit the spiritual successor to the music-centric networks of the '80s and '90s. Not only can you look up music videos for all of your favorite bands, but you can also follow ongoing documentary series, check out up-and-coming artists and even watch a live stream of curated music videos that runs 24/7. The service skews a bit heavy on pop and hip-hop, but then again, doesn't all music television? \nFree on Vevo \nWhat to Stream Picking a streaming service is just the first step. The real nitty gritty is deciding what to watch. We've scoured the options on Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, HBO Now and Showtime Anytime to bring you the best shows to binge watch . We'll tell you which service has each show and exactly how long it will take for you to watch every episode. \n\nCord cutters should also check out our best HDTV Antennas page to make sure they never miss local sports and weather. \n\nHow to Watch Live TV Online Roku Channels to Download Now How to Stream Video to a TV from a Mobile Device or Computer \n\nAbout the author Marshall Honorof @marshallhonorof Marshall Honorof is a senior writer for Tom's Guide, covering gaming hardware, security and streaming video.

I happen to have 4 in my large family. For this I pay $20.00 a month for Netflix. On Hulu I would be paying $32.00 for the same level of service. Also, Amazon prime is sharable as well with my family so Hulu is the most expensive option not Netflix. 0 mwaldrep4571 May 14, 2016, 3:24 PM Now with new HDCP 2.2 requirements and HDMI 2.0 requirements, you can't watch HD or UHD streaming unless all hardware meets that standard with Amazon Prime. I also heard that Netflix is starting that also. The only service that appears to still offer HD is Hulu. Unless you make good money and can afford to purchase a New HDTV that meets requirements and if you want to stream via PC or MAC you have to buy a new PC or buy a new video card that meets that standard you are not able to stream at HD or UHD quality. Oh, and Apple doesn't have a mac that meets those standards yet. Not even the Mac Pro. 0 guganye May 18, 2016, 6:25 AM think of another \"Cons\" for most of the online streaming services: available only within USA! 0 rlndsz May 28, 2016, 8:10 AM lol so Hulu has \"Subpar movie selection\" and Netflix has \"Excellent selection\". You got that backward, unless you mean the number of titles. Netflix selection of movies however large it is, 80% of it are pure trash. On Hulu side you have superior quality movies and also the whole Criterion collection, with excellent titles, nothing comes near that on Netflix side. 0 Vault101 Jun 21, 2016, 8:34 AM Marshall Honorof, You missed one - VUDU allows you to purchase and rent .Keeping a large library of movies and TV seasons available for viewing. the downside to them is that they use ports that certain firewalls will block. Check them out, I would love to get your feedback. 0 Justin_87 Jun 21, 2016, 9:11 AM Playstation Vue is available on Amazon Fire TV, as well as Playstation. Also, the prices are $29.99 for Access Slim (55+ channels), $34.99 for Core Slim (70+ channels), and $44.99 for Elite Slim (100+ channels). I live in Austin and it is available here, so I'm not sure why you are misquoting this stuff. If you actually wrote and published this article on May 4th, then you source of info is bad, because these have been the prices well before May 4th and included many more markets. 0 gordokc77 Oct 3, 2016, 11:06 PM Hulu is nothing but crap all they do is send you to other sites so you're paying $8 to $10 a month for what to be sent to a website you could have went to anyway if you want to stream something you need to get on a good site like Showbox are YouTube rest of them are no good HBO is okay but they want so much money and they don't even play dirty movies 0 Chris_C_K Nov 21, 2016, 6:09 AM Hulu is jammed packed with adverts! They just don't get the whole pay for streaming paradigm. 0 Comment Firstname Submit",

PST November 21, 2016 Comedian Dave Chappelle CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nThree new Dave Chappelle specials are coming to Netflix in 2017. \nEarlier this month, the comedian made his return to TV, hosting Saturday Night Live on Nov. 12. On Monday, Netflix announced the release of three new specials with Chappelle, with premiere dates yet to be announced. \nFor the first special, Chappelle will reunite with director/producer Stan Lathan, who led the comedian's past hits, Killin’ Them Softly (HBO) and For What It's Worth (Showtime), for an original stand-up special exclusively on Netflix. \nThe second two concert specials, also directed by Lathan, represent Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years, containing previously-unseen footage from two shows at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium, and will be released simultaneously by Netflix. \nThe three Netflix projects are Chappelle's first TV specials since For What It’s Worth aired in 2004. Since his controversial departure from Chappelle's Show in 2005, the comedian has resumed touring, performing over 500 concerts since 2013. His recent SNL hosting stint earned the show its highest ratings in three years. \nCopyright 2016 KXTV ",

      "text": "Netflix Viewers on Windows 10 Can Now Stream 4K Content in Microsoft Edge PCs are required to have seventh-generation Intel Core processor 4K capable screens are required for UHD streaming from Netflix Not all subscriptions are offering option of streaming in 4K \nNetflix has allowed users to stream 4K content for quite some time now but kept PC users away from this privilege up until now. The video streaming service has now announced that users with Windows 10 PCs will now be able to stream content in Ultra HD resolution using the Microsoft Edge browser. \nMicrosoft has clarified that in order to stream 4K content from Netflix, the user's set up \"must have a 4K-capable screen and use a 7th Gen Intel Core Processor.\" Further it should be noted that neither all content is available in Ultra-HD resolution nor all subscriptions allow streaming in 4K. In order to enjoy the 4K content users will be required to upgrade to Premium monthly subscription, which is available for Rs. 800 a month in India. \n( Also see : Microsoft Woos Users to Edge Browser by Touting 1080p Netflix Playback ) \"Your binge-watching favourites on Netflix are now available in 4K exclusively on compatible PCs and 2-in-1 devices, on Windows 10. Check out the new streaming experience with Microsoft Edge, the only browser that supports Netflix 4K content,\" Microsoft said in a blog post on Monday.\nThe blog post includes a plug for Microsoft Edge's power consumption claims, says that Edge users will be able to watch at least 1 more episode than Chrome users due to the improved battery life they will enjoy. The new Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, premieres on Friday. \nNetflix has clearly stated on its website that a download speed of at least 25Mbps per stream is recommended to receive Ultra HD content. \nRecently, Google started testing 4K UHD movie purchase and rental options through Google Play store and Google Play Movies & TV app. The company also started shipping its Chromecast Ultra dongle, with support for 4K, earlier this month in the US.",

      "text": " 01 AM People in the news Chappelle plans concert specials for Netflix in '17 \nNEW YORK – Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years – three shows to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,”‘‘Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nThis month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. \n– Associated Press",

If you make a purchase by clicking one of our links, we may earn a small share of the revenue. However, our picks and opinions are independent from USA TODAY’s newsroom and any business incentives.\nAll week for the Black Friday madness coming up this weekend, Roku is serving up some piping-hot discounts on streaming devices and Roku sticks old and new. There's also a secret extra-special deal coming Friday morning, so check back for the update.\nGranted, this is probably just Roku and retail partners' way of making space for all the brand-spankin' new 2016 Roku devices that just launched , but hey, no reason that shoppers can't make out like little TV-loving bandits.\nRoku Streaming Stick – $34.99, SAVE $15 The 2016 Streaming Stick remains one of the most popular streaming content devices on the market for good reason. This hyper-portable little stick simply plugs into your TV's HDMI input—an input that your TV definitely has unless it's a decade old or so—and is powered by USB or AC adapter.\nHook it up to your WiFi network and you'll be able to stream apps like Netflix or Hulu Plus with the greatest of ease. It'll also work with motel/hotel WiFi and is about the size of a pack of gum, making it an ideal gift for on-the-go binge-watchers.\nRoku Express+ – $25, SAVE $15 (Walmart exclusive) (Photo: Wal-Mart)\nThe new Roku Express+ is a new entry-level streaming device that's pretty perfect for content lovers looking for an affordable way to access their favorite apps. But it's also the only streaming device on the market right now that'll support sub-HD sources via composite inputs.\nThis means you don't need a fancy new—er... a new—okay, if you somehow still have a boxy CRT, projector, or an in-car entertainment system that uses the old analog (red, white, yellow) inputs, the Express+ is perfect for you! You weirdo.\nRoku 2 – $49.99, SAVE $20 (Kohl's exclusive) (Photo: Kohl's)\nThe Roku 2 is one of the older Roku models, but it still usually goes for $70 and remains a snappy, powerful way to access all that content. While it may not be as new as the more affordable Express or Express+, it's definitely the faster, more efficacious device, great for power users who don't yet need 4K.\nWhat you're sacrificing in portability, you're more than making up for in terms of internal storage and overall responsiveness. The Roku 2 even includes an ethernet input, meaning you can ease off your WiFi if the network's already pretty congested.\nRoku 3 – $49.99, SAVE $50 (Best Buy exclusive) (Photo: Reviewed.com)\nOne of the best reviewed devices of the pre-4K \"old guard,\" the Roku 3 will be available exlusively at Best Buy for $50. It's usually $100, and includes the fancy headphone-jack equipped remote, audio and ethernet port options, and processing/storage that's still up-to-snuff by most modern standards.\nIt also includes some nifty purple in-ear headphones, voice search, second-screen app compatibility, and (of course) up to 1080p HD video streaming from all those wonderful Roku channels. Nice!\nUSA TODAY\nThe best Black Friday deals online",

The other two projects will come from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault: The first was produced at the Austin City Limits venue and the second at the Hollywood Palladium in 2015 and 2016, respectively. \nThe projects are Chappelle’s first stand-up TV specials in 12 years, according to Netflix, and are on the heels of his first hosting gig at Saturday Night Live earlier this month.

      "text": "Netflix ( NFLX ) shares jumped Monday after Brean Capital initiated coverage of the internet television network with a buy rating and a price target of 145.\nNetflix stock rose 2.4% to 117.96 on the stock market today .\n\"Netflix has created an unstoppable lead in the internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term,\" Brean analyst Alan Gould said in a research report. \"It is on a path to become the largest spender on entertainment content, creating a content moat and amortizing it over a global direct-to-consumer audience, making it the low cost producer.\"\nIBD'S TAKE: Netflix stock has an IBD Composite Rating of 85, meaning it has outperformed 85% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Netflix stock has been building a cup-with-handle base , with a possible buy point of 129.39. \nNetflix stock looks expensive on traditional metrics because of its international losses and steep investment in original content, Gould said.\nHe says Netflix can attract 300 million global subscribers in 15 years and become a profit machine once it is past its investment mode.\nNetflix ended the third quarter with nearly 87 million streaming video subscribers worldwide. Gould is modeling Netflix to have over 100 million subscribers next year and 250 million in a decade.\nThe primary concern for Netflix is competition, including Amazon.com ( AMZN ), Hulu, Time Warner ( TWX )-owned HBO and established pay-TV services, Gould said.\n\"Netflix has entered the virtuous circle that HBO used to claim – the more subscribers it has the more it can spend on great content, leading to more subscribers, which in turn, allows it to spend even more on content, and so on,\" Gould said.\nNetflix has produced such critically acclaimed shows as \"The Crown,\" \"Stranger Things,\" \"Narcos\" and \"Orange Is the New Black.\"",

      "text": "Netflix has three Dave Chappelle comedy specials coming 8:53 am \nNetflix is always adding content, both original and otherwise, but one bright spot ahead is the return of Dave Chappelle, which includes not one, not two, but three comedy specials for Netflix. \nThe streaming service announced that three selections from the comedian will be released together in 2017. Right now details are somewhat scarce, but Netflix did reveal one of the shows will be a new stand-up special while the other two will be unreleased material from performances at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Palladium. \nThe announcement comes after reports that Netflix paid $40 million for two stand-up specials from Chris Rock. They also have comedy material from Dana Carvey, Aziz Ansari, Patton Oswalt, Ali Wong, Hannibal Buress and many others. The streaming service is practically a comedy channel in their own right now. Netflix has been adding fresh stand-up material to its library of original content for some time now and the addition of Chappelle will do a great job of boosting viewership next year. Which is obviously the whole point. Dave Chappelle has been away for too long and fans are eager for more of his comedy, so this is perfect. We should not have long to wait now.",

      "text": "‘Saving Mes Aynak’ on iTunes, Amazon, Netflix coming soon November 21, 2016 | By \nEVANSTON - “ Saving Mes Aynak ,” the documentary by a Northwestern University filmmaker about a race to save the 5,000-year-old Buddhist archaeological site from destruction, has been released on DVD and digitally by iTunes and Amazon . The film is expected to debut on Netflix in January. \nSaving Mes Aynak has received rave reviews around the world and been honored with numerous awards. Huffman will show the film at the prestigious National Gallery in Washington, D.C., on Nov. 27. \nBeneath Mes Aynak lie huge copper reserves worth an estimated $100 billion. The site’s owners, a state-owned Chinese mining company, plan to begin excavating this year. In the process of open-pit mining, the entire site could be destroyed. \nDirector Brent Huffman, an associate professor of journalism at Northwestern University’s Medill School of Journalism, Media, Integrated Marketing Communications, spent four years documenting the work at Mes Aynak and continues to advocate for its preservation. \n“The biggest success of the documentary is to have delayed mining from happening at Mes Aynak for more than four years,” Huffman said. “The awareness campaign around the film was also able to raise over $10,000 to buy necessary equipment for the Afghan archaeologists risking their lives at the archaeological site.” \nLocated within a Taliban-controlled region in Afghanistan, Mes Aynak is a significant cultural and historical site, potentially comparable to Machu Picchu or Pompeii. A sprawling, epic city, it is home to over 600 life-size or larger Buddhist statues, dozens of temple structures and an enormous circular complex. So far, only an estimated 10 percent of the site has been excavated. \nBut the threat to Mes Aynak remains despite the film’s success. \n“The bad news is that the Afghan government could end the archaeological dig and let the mining company begin mining at any time,” he said. “I am working to bring in enough international support to permanently protect and preserve Mes Aynak and stop all mining from happening in this area.”",

      "text": "Fans of the TV show “Gilmore Girls” are already excited that the show’s revival miniseries “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” airs this week.\nBut this Netflix-only series may not be the end of Lorelai and Rori.\nThe two actresses who play the main characters revealed as much in an interview with Metro, saying they’re refusing to rule out another round of episodes.\n“It’s hard to say,” Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai, told Metro. “I love it so much that I would just want to do what’s best for the show. I think what we’ve done was such a great piece, this miniseries to me was incredibly gratifying.”\nShe also said that the show’s creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino, always planned for the show to fit a “Sherlock” style show, where the plot moves throughout time and doesn’t stay stuck to one constant story model.\n“Amy always had the Sherlock model in mind,” Graham said, according to Metro. “Some years it’s three, some years it’s one, some years they go back in time. So perhaps we need to go back in time? I don’t know, it’s hard to say.”\nBut there may be some more evidence out there that “A Year in the Life” won’t be the end.\nThe show’s creator always intended on finishing the show with four final words that were to be spoken at the end of the series finale. But Sherman-Palladino left the show after its sixth season, and the four words were never spoken in the seventh season finale , according to Hello Giggles, a social news website.\nSherman-Palladino returned to the helm for the Netflix series, so her plans could finally be realized. She said on a press tour in July that she hopes people don’t fast-forward to the end of the story to hear those final four words.\n“It would be great if people who wanted to see the last four words first got some therapy first and got rid of that inclination,” she said during a panel at Netflix’s TCA press tour. “It really is a journey.  It’s going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip. It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it.”\nBoth Alexis Bledel, who plays Rori, and Graham said that the final four words weren’t included in the script.\nBased on the mystery surrounding those final four words, fans are holding their breath about what may happen after the Netflix miniseries ends.\n“Of course this all depends on how 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' ends and what those fated four last words reveal,” according to HelloGiggles. “Perhaps things will get all tied up or perhaps things will be left open for more visits to Stars Hollow.”",

Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said.\nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in The Nutty Professor, Con Air and Blue Streak . In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, Chappelle’s Show, until his abrupt exit in its third season.\nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s Saturday Night Live , mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.",

Posted on YouTube, the clip from Netflix advertises Vista — and no, it doesn't mean endless crashes and general uselessness (à la Microsoft). Instead, this Vista allows you to view shows from your eyes wherever you go, suggesting a creepy future of zombie-eyed people on your daily commute is not so far off. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Well, do not fret too much, as the ad is actually a plug for Netflix's Black Mirror , the concept taken from season one episode 'The Entire History of You', where head implants record everything that you do. With taglines such as \"what if the things you love could always be with you\", we wonder if Netflix is ironically actually encouraging this dystopian future. Still, life does not get much better than curling into bed and binging on a show with a cup of tea, so we are all for it (minus the implant side, thank you very much). © Netflix The latest series of Black Mirror premiered on Netflix a few weeks ago, giving us fresh nightmares about the not too inconceivable future and our relationship to technology. The show also gave us all a sobering tweet when they pointed out that the election of Donald Trump was \"not an episode\", creator Charlie Brooker suggesting the US had elected its \"first openly crazy man\" to the presidency. Black Mirror is streaming now on Netflix. Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?
