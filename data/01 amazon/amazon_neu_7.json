      "text": "Amazon Stock: Is Online Black Friday the New Cyber Monday? By Stephen Karmazyn   28, 2016 Can Amazon Stock Take Advantage of Shoppers’ Changing Habits? \nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Amazon stock must be absolutely ecstatic as early numbers coming out of online Black Friday show that more purchases were made in the online space versus a brick-and-mortar shop. \nAn estimated 51% of shoppers’ holiday budgets were projected to be spent this weekend via e-commerce, according to a survey by consulting firm Deloitte . This is up about two percent from last year, and marks the first time that Thanksgiving shopping occurred more in cyberspace vs. the physical world. (Source: “” Cyber Friday,” anyone? Online sales besting in-store sales, ” CBS News , November 25, 2016.) This has of course led to an e-commerce war of sorts, where traditional giants like Amazon await the flood of consumers (and a potential boon to Amazon stock), while Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (NYSE: WMT ) hopes to become a challenger in the e-commerce holiday market. For example, Walmart unveiled a new app and tripled the number of goods available from its e-commerce site. “E-commerce was off to a strong start, with Thanksgiving Day online shopping at $1.93 billion, according to Adobe Digital Insight, up 11.5 percent from last year. Mobile purchases, using phones and tablets, accounted for 57 percent of the online total,” CBS News reported. “For the entire November-December holiday season, Forrester Research forecasts that online sales will exceed the $100 billion mark, surging 17 percent to $112 billion.” [Source: Ibid.] \nBut that doesn’t mean that all physical stores are dead during the yearly holiday shopping ritual. Kohl’s reported record Thanksgiving sales, even though online sales had recently eaten into the department store’s profits. \nBut if consumers are hoping that they can avoid the line by jumping on the internet, they might not be too pleased with what they find. On Friday, Macy’s website was the online equivalent of our biggest shopping nightmares, with lines so packed that consumers had to wait sometimes as long as 30 seconds to connect to the website. \nThis, of course, is 30 seconds in internet time, which we all know follows Interstellar rules, where one second online is actually hours in the real world. Amazon stock would certainly prefer that their lines are processed much smoother. \nEditor’s Note: Hi, Stephen Karmazyn  ",

      "text": "  \nOne great thing about the holidays is giving. But not everybody has the money to give. Amazon has money to give... I'm being needlessly indirect... So, a family member of mine, who is a doctor in Seattle, runs a charity called Flow of Hope. Its main purpose is to help children in Kenya get food, shelter, and an education. This is their website. On it, you can find the stories of all involved members and how to donate . However, you do not need to donate to help out. If you shop on Amazon, you can help out through your shopping. Simply use smile.amazon instead of the regular amazon website. Once there, it will ask you to choose a charity, if you type in Flow of Hope and select it, every purchase you make through smile.amazon will result in a donation to the charity. So, just thought I'd throw that out there if anyone happened to be interested,Happy Holidays",

The best feature is of course Alexa's voice search integration letting you very quickly find the shows you want in addition Alexa's other features. \nDyson Ball Multi-Room Vacuum for $249 (Orig $399) One deal that was entirely missing from this year's Black Friday deals was a Dyson vacuum cleaner. Luckily Amazon's Cyber Monday sale has one but we anticipate it will not last long so act fast. This is one of the lowest prices for a brand new Dyson Ball vacuum we've seen since last Black Friday. \nFire Kids Edition 7\" Tablet w/ Kid Proof Case for $74.99 (Orig $100) This is the cheapest price on the highly rated Kids tablet we've seen. We played with this ourselves and are mighty impressed with the super protective case it includes. Best of all this has unlimited access to 10,000 kid friendly and eductional books, movies and TV shows and you can control just how much screentime the kids get. Act fast as this is backordered and you can still get this in time for Christmas. \nNew Amazon Fire HD8 Quad-Core Tablet for $59.99 (Orig $89.99) This is the lowest price we've seen on the new Fire HD8. It's a fantastic little media tablet with a sharp display, dual stereo speakers, and you get acess to Amazon Undergrounds gargantuan free app store and never pay for another app. If you are a Prime member you will want to have this as you can download movies and shows to watch on a plane. \nCyber Monday Fitbit Discount: $60 Fitbit Flex 2, $85 Alta, $110 Charge 2, $127 Blaze Smart Watch These deals are a good 10-15% cheaper than we saw on the already discounted Black Friday prices and now the new lowest price we've seen all year. We encourage you to act fast as we don't believe these will last long. \nBlendtec Total Blender w/ FourSide Jar & 1560W 3HP Motor for $237.99 ($402.99) BlendTec makes the same powerful smoothie makers you find at Jamba Juice. It has one of the more powerful motors at 3HP and will easily make smoothies, soups, and more. Clean up by blending water and detergent for a few seconds. This is one of the lowest prices we've seen for any blender with this size and power. \nCyber Monday Special: Up to 40% off Kindle Unlimited Subscription: 1-year for $80.32, 2-Years for $143.85 (Orig $120 for 1-year or $240 for 2-years) Amazon discounts their Kindle Unlimited Subscriptions only once a year during Cyber Monday. They are offering 33% off when you sign-up for a 1-year subscription or 40% off for 2 years. At the $9.99 list price you are easily already saving yourself money. At the discounted prices you pay only $7 a month which is a massive savings compared to buying a $15 book every month. \nKitchenAid Professional 6-Quart Stand Mixer with Bowl Lift for $219.95 (Orig $549.99) This is the gift for any baking enthusiast. This is one of the best prices we've seen for the professional version and cheaper than the smaller and less featured versions. Whether it's for Christmas, a wedding gift, or for yourself this is simply an unbeatable price. \niRobot Roomba 770 Robot Vacuum for $379.99 (Orig $500) The Roomba has been a popular vacuum to buy over this Holiday weekend with the lower end 650 model selling out. While the lower price on the $650 is appealing the 770 has a number of functions that will make you want to upgrade. It includes dual HEPA filters, has sensors to concentrate more cleaning on dirtier areas, and a remote control to start cleaning from the couch or bed. \n65\" Samsung 4K Ultra HD LED Smart HDTV w/ HDR + $200 Dell Gift Card for $1099.99 (Orig $1800) If you were in the market for a great large screen TV, then this Samsung 6 series TV checks off all the boxes you want in a new TV: 4K resolution, sleek curved display and HDR support. It is getting strong reviews for picture quality and was our favorite HDTV deal for Black Friday that you can still get. APC 1500VA Uninterruptible Power Supply with Pure Sine Wave for $129.95 (Orig $205) The APC power supply keeps your computer or whatever you have plugged into it running even when the power goes out. This gives you enough time to power down a computer before it shuts down. We have the same capacity power supply connected to our cable modem and router so that our internet keeps going for hours until the power goes back up. \nLast Day: Lowest prices of the year on Kindles: $50 Kindle, $90 Paperwhite, $170 Voyage These are the lowest prices all we've seen all year long on the Kindles and will end after today. At $50 the Kindle is still one of the best eReaders out there. For serious readers or those looking for an upgrade, the Paperwhite and Voyage have a higher resolution display and built-in backlights. Lastly, for serious readers and travelers the Voyage has design details you will appreciate: higher build quality, an adaptive backlight and PagePress buttons. \nRubbermaid FreshWorks Producer Saver 2-Pack for $13.99 (Orig $20) Don't let your produce go to waste. These Rubbermaid containers are specially designed to keep produce fresher for longer. There are specially designed vents that regulate the perfect amount of air coming in and out. There is even a little platform to keep your produce out of any moisture that sits on the bottom.",

      "text": "Jeremy Clarkson is My Hill to Die On Plus good, the bad, and the weird of Amazon’s The Grand Tour. H ow do we separate the artist from their art? If we’re being honest with ourselves, it’s not a particularly difficult task. There will be people who go down defending their love of Chinatown despite the fact that director Roman Polanski was charged with rape in 1977. Others will forever hold Annie Hall up as a classic in one breath, while only sort of condemning director Woody Allen for the allegations of sexual assault levied against him in the 90s. I’m sure there’s someone out there still wearing their Cosby sweater proudly, for whatever twisted reason. We’re experiencing this phenomenon in this year’s Oscar race, as well. Both Casey Affleck — who stands as a contender for Best Actor but is also embroiled in a sexual harassment case  — and The Birth of a Nation director Nate Parker — whose 15-year old rape allegations have polluted his film’s Oscar campaign — are part of discussion about whether or not we can separate the art from the artist. If they are a bad person, but make something potentially culturally important, do we hold that against the art? There will be some who will choose these hills to die on, to go to bat for the art despite the artist. And many of them will make excellent arguments, whereas others will have every write to take the opposing position. I’m not sure any of those are my hills to die on. As much as I enjoy Casey Affleck’s work or may yet appreciate The Birth of a Nation on its own, it will be hard to get over those disturbing allegations. I will, however, go to bat for Jeremy Clarkson ’s right to continue to make eccentric, wonderfully entertaining shows about cars. Sure, Clarkson’s tenure as the host of the BBC’s Top Gear ended when he punched a producer over an incorrect meal order. And he’s got a long history of being a jerk, a likely racist, and a diva. But he did once punch Piers Morgan, which I’d say is in the plus category. What I understand Jeremy Clarkson is that there is a sense of hyper-unseriousness to the way he collects himself. Like many a great comedian, he is a provocateur — he is the purveyor of a particular brand of coarseness. You can see this in the faces of Richard Hammond and James May , his longtime co-hosts. Assaulting someone is a step too far, let’s be clear, but much of the rest of Clarkson’s transgressions have been within the realm of calculated brand-building. Hammond is the naive charmer, May is the well-reasoned square, and Clarkson is the asshole. Their dynamic delivered 20+ series worth of delight for motoring enthusiasts the world over. It was also a delight for those of us who aren’t motoring enthusiasts. I drive a 2004 Mazda 3. I’ve never purchased a spoiler, upgraded an engine, considered buying a supercar, or even changed my own oil. On average, I drive one mile per hour below the speed limit at all times. Considering genre and direct content appeal, I’m about as far from Clarkson, May, and Hammond’s target audience as possible. But there world is endlessly fascinating. It’s an etherial environment in which million-dollar cars and blistering speeds are the norm. Where garage talk and contentious words for anti-motorist municipalities are the agenda of the day. And it works because of stow-and-go storage spaces full of charm and wit from its three hosts. This is what drew me into the world of Top Gear and it’s the reason I’ve followed these three ruffians to Amazon, where their new show The Grand Tour lives exclusively. In two episodes, they’ve managed to draw me back in with their knowledge and irreverence. There are meta jokes that speak directly to former Top Gear watchers and cinematic car reviews that will impress anyone who loves a little bit of filmmaking craft. Among the many things that have carried over from the BBC to Amazon is the energy and momentum each episode has, in part because executive producer Andy Wilman has also come along for the ride. The opening two frames of The Grand Tour aren’t perfect. There have been jokes that go on a bit too long — including one about killing off celebrity guests and another involving the trio on a special forces training course — but these are kinks that any hour-long variety show will have to work out. Without the old standbys from Top Gear  — like “Celebrity in a Reasonably Priced Car” and “The Stig” — there will be some rough patches. But the DNA of a great show, let alone a great car show, are there. Because Clarkson, May, and Hammond are there. When these three take to the road and become their own worst enemies, it’s to our great benefit. The other potentially great piece of The Grand Tour’s puzzle can be found in segments like the one in episode two, in which James May ventures into one of Johannesburg, South Africa’s tire-shredding “Wheelz ‘n Smoke” spinning events. May’s discomfort with the smell of burning tires aside, the vignette is an example of where The Grand Tour can go the extra mile beyond Top Gear . With their traveling circus theme, they can highlight the many different subcultures within motoring enthusiasm. Instead of simply hiding away and reviewing cars on their dreary English track or zipping through Europe’s beautiful (though obviously closed off for the purposes of shooting) roads, we can get more of the world’s motoring culture. It’s reminiscent of their best work on Top Gear , whether its their drive through Chernobyl or their African special , their best moments are spent exploring the world. And, of course, there are always going to be moments like this one: I understand that struggle. Sort of. Say what you may about Clarkson’s abrasiveness, but his lack of self-seriousness implies that he understands his role in this narrative. He’s the foil for those who would take any of this too seriously. As long as he refrains from punching anyone not named Piers Morgan in the future, I’d say we’re good here. As for Amazon’s The Grand Tour, it’s question of having staying power will be a matter of getting these kinks worked out of the show’s structure. For those susceptible to their charm, the return of Clarkson, May, and Hammond is enough for now, alongside the promise that the tour will indeed be Grand. In order to create the kind of longterm success they had with Top Gear , the trio and their trusty collaborator Mr. Wilman will need to continue to push the envelope, lay on the charm, and show us a world apart from our own. By my estimation, they are well on their way.",

      "text": "Joshua Lott / Getty If it wasn’t already clear, this Thanksgiving weekend proves it: Walmart’s future runs through Amazon.com. For the first time ever, millions more shoppers shopped online than in stores during Thanksgiving and Black Friday weekend, signaling a tipping of the scales that’s unlikely to reverse course anytime soon. According to the National Retail Federation, 44 percent of Americans surveyed this weekend said they shopped online during Thanksgiving weekend compared with only 40 percent who shopped in brick-and-mortar stores. Seeing where things were headed, Walmart was more aggressive than in the past on assortment and pricing leading into the holiday season. The retailer was beating Amazon on 20 percent of top-selling toys that both companies sold, and matched its prices on another 35 percent. \nCode Commerce Series is coming to SF on Dec. 6 \nDon't miss interviews with Jack Dorsey, Kate Hudson and Apple Pay Register Now Walmart’s aggressiveness online will only become more crucial going forward. The company spent $3.3 billion to acquire Jet.com and its CEO Marc Lore, who is now heading up Walmart.com as well. Lore will be expected to turn Walmart’s stores and supply chain expertise into a real advantage over Amazon. He’s also tasked with building on Jet’s unique pricing models to help Walmart.com compete even better with Amazon on price. While online sales account for only 3 percent of Walmart’s total revenue, the acquisition of Jet by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon said a lot about how the Arkansas-based retailer views the sales channel going forward. By this time next year, when e-commerce is playing an even bigger role in holiday shopping industry-wide, we’ll have a better idea if the acquisition was worth it. recode_divider",

      "text": "Last Modified: Mon, Nov 28 2016. 08 24 PM IST Amazon gets real about fakes Amazon is starting a new initiative to banish counterfeiters   Spencer Soper Amazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. Photo: Reuters \nSeattle: Randy Hetrick first noticed counterfeits on Amazon.com Inc. in 2013. He had been selling his TRX Training System—an exercise kit of suspension straps—on the site since 2008. When he began noticing cheap imitations, he had his employees scour Amazon for more, then go through the tedious process of reporting them for removal. But new imposters would pop up right away, and by 2014, “We realized this was an epidemic,” said Hetrick, who estimates phonies cost him $100 million a year, twice his annual sales. \nAmazon’s Marketplace gives inventors like Hetrick exposure to hundreds of millions of shoppers without the big expense of building and promoting a website from scratch. Merchants give Amazon a commission on each sale. But a hot-selling product on Amazon encourages counterfeiters to make flimsy knockoffs with cheap materials, steal sales and damage a brand with few consequences. \nAmazon has known the problem is getting worse, according to a person familiar with the matter, but for years, the company has been largely silent about the flourishing fakes. That has frustrated manufacturers and brand owners who bear the cost and responsibility of policing the site, reporting problems and hoping Amazon takes action. \nALSO READ | Flipkart, Amazon most preferred; Paytm sees sharp rise in popularity \nNow, the world’s biggest online retailer is getting serious. It has made fighting phonies a major goal for 2017, building teams in the US and Europe to work with major brands on a registry to prevent fakes, according to a person familiar with the initiative, who was not authorized to speak about the matter and requested anonymity. Discussions with Major League Baseball and the National Football League about selling merchandise on Amazon hit a standstill earlier this year due to concerns about Amazon’s lack of control over fakes, the person said. \n“Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” Amazon said in a statement. The company said it was “aggressively pursuing bad actors.” In a statement, the MLB said: “It is our responsibility to provide our fans with reliable and secure marketplaces to purchase officially licensed merchandise. Given the rampant growth of online-only retailers supplying counterfeit merchandise, our policies must hold every distribution partner to that same level of commitment.” The NFL declined to comment. \nThe new Amazon teams will encourage brands—even those that don’t sell on Amazon—to register with the online store, the person said. Once registered, Amazon requires any marketplace merchants listing those products to prove that they have the brand’s permission to sell them online. Amazon began experimenting with the registry earlier this year with Nike and other companies. The bigger push in 2017 will target thousands of large companies, including those that have been reluctant to sell on Amazon because of knock-offs. \nIn addition, this month Amazon teamed up with Hetrick’s business to sue three people, accusing them of selling fakes on its site. It filed another similar suit the same day against an alleged counterfeit ring. Moving the battle to a courtroom is an acknowledgment that despite spending tens of millions of dollars a year and employing an army of software engineers, investigators and research scientists tasked with fighting copycats, Amazon is not winning the war against counterfeiters. \nALSO READ | Amul to debut on Amazon overseas on Black Friday \n“The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,” said Hetrick, who is encouraged by Amazon’s new vigilance. “You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm for these shysters selling illegal goods.” \nAmazon is desperately trying to bring order to the Wild West atmosphere on its marketplace, where more than 2 million independent sellers compete for the attention and money of shoppers. About half of the goods purchased on Amazon come from independent merchants, who help Amazon expand its inventory more quickly and with less upfront cost than Amazon could do on its own. It also makes the retailer and its customers more vulnerable to fakes because the simple online registration process currently in place is designed to make it easy for businesses to begin selling immediately. But that also makes it simple for counterfeiters to list fake goods, sell as many as they can before they’re detected, and then vanish. \nAmazon’s suits targeting sellers were the first of their kind for the company, a warning to counterfeiters heading into the busy holiday shopping season when the most is at stake. It could be too little, too late. \nThe shift of spending from stores with tight inventory controls to online marketplaces where it’s tough to distinguish between fake and authentic is fueling a rise in counterfeiting that shows no signs of slowing. Alibaba and Ebay are also grappling with copycat products. Counterfeits made up nearly $500 billion, or 2.5%, of global imports in 2013, a figure expected to grow as more spending shifts online, according to an April report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. China is the biggest source of phonies. \nDespite efforts to decrease them, complaints about imitations on Amazon have been growing along with its inventory since at least 2014, according to a person familiar with the matter. What Amazon has known internally for years is spilling into the public eye. Birkenstock announced it would cease selling products on Amazon in January due to concerns about counterfeits. And in October, Apple Inc. sued an Amazon supplier claiming the business sold fake Apple products—some of them unsafe—on Amazon. \nALSO READ | Amazon delivery pilots ordered to end strike for retail peak \n“Online counterfeiting is never going to go down,” said Stuart Fuller, director of commercial operations at NetNames, which helps brands identify marketplaces and websites where counterfeit products are sold. “Amazon is the most trusted marketplace in the world. That in and of itself attracts this nefarious element because they know shoppers go there and trust what they are buying is genuine.” \nBret Rosenzweig is another inventor who has felt the sting of counterfeits on Amazon. His company, DC Innovations, makes the Urban Shelf, a collapsible plastic nightstand that wedges between a mattress and box spring. Bachelors and college students are the target market, and Amazon was the perfect place to introduce the product to the masses in 2009. Once his sales on Amazon started picking up around 2015, counterfeiters took notice, mimicked the design with cheaper materials and offered it for less. That’s a double-blow to Rosenzweig, who loses a sale and now has a potential customer unimpressed with his brand (or what the customer thinks is his brand). \nRosenzweig checks Amazon each day, scouring the marketplace for counterfeiters selling his product. The process of reporting the fakes to Amazon has been a time-suck. He spots a knock-off, buys the item and when he receives it, he takes photos and submits a report to Amazon. The company is usually quick about suspending the counterfeiters, but new accounts quickly spring up in their place and the game of whack-a-mole continues, Rosenzweig said. \nHe can no longer order phony items to his home address because his adversaries know he is conducting a test purchase, so he has his business partner order them. Rosenzweig said he’d welcome any new effort from Amazon to crack down. “Buying the fakes and reporting them is a waste of my time,” he said. \nAmazon, EBay and Alibaba are largely shielded from legal liability as long as they have processes in place for brands to report fake goods and take timely action to suspend their sale once notified. The online marketplaces often don’t have the inventory, so there is nothing to seize. The result is an endless loop with brands buying and reporting fakes, marketplaces suspending accounts, and the fraudsters creating new accounts to hawk the same fake goods under new pseudonyms. EBay lets registered brand owners report suspected counterfeit listings for removal, as does Alibaba. \nBut the retailers can only do so much. Shoppers worried about buying fakes during the holidays have to bear some responsibility, said Akino Chikada, senior brand protection manager at the firm MarkMonitor, which helps brands find online sources of counterfeits. She suggests looking closely at web addresses for subtle variations from brand names and probing websites for sloppy privacy and return policies, which can signal a phony. Bargain basement prices are another tell-tale sign, though sophisticated counterfeiters try to make the price difference less suspicious by coming in at 10% or 20% below other offers rather than half price, she said. \n“Counterfeiters do a good job mimicking the look and feel of a brand,” she said. “It’s so easy for people, in just a few clicks, to unknowingly buy counterfeit goods.” Bloomberg",

      "text": "When Amazon Becomes Scamazon! The NEW Trend in Online Fraud! November 28, 2016 by Nicole How much do you trust Amazon? Well, if you have ever made purchases from them, you know that they offer an almost flawless level of customer service. There’s a good reason why Amazon is the largest online retailer out there. What you may not realize is there are people out there who are willing to exploit and damage Amazon’s relationship with its customers at the expense of ignorant consumers. If you were making a purchase from Amazon, would you be skeptical if a third party seller requested you to purchase gift cards to use as payment for your transaction. Sounds sketchy, right? Well, if you trust Amazon, you may be inclined to ignore just how odd this request may be. This is exactly what has been happening to some consumers who have fallen victim to scammers hiding within the Amazon sales network. Many unknowing consumers have been duped out of hundred and even thousands of dollars by following seller instructions to purchase gift cards as a form of payment for their wares. Shady Amazon sellers will leave instructions to contact them prior to purchasing an item. These sellers then instruct potential buyers to purchase Amazon Gift Cards to cover the cost of the item and request that the potential buyer simply give them the gift card numbers to complete the transaction and the item will then be shipped. The reality is, the items never get shipped and the consumers are left with no resolution. Amazon refuses to accommodate consumers who complete the purchase requirements outside of the Amazon payment network. The sad reality is…they don’t have to. It’s written plain as day in their policies NOT to do this. It may sound like common sense, but the communications between potential buyers and scummy sellers can be very convincing to an unknowing consumer. It’s happening more often then you think and if it DOES happen, there’s no way to recoup the lost money. So what can you do to protect yourself? Be wary of sellers who request communication prior to purchase. Do not under any circumstances complete any payments outside of the Amazon payment system. You should never have to leave the Amazon site to complete a purchase. Doing so will leave you unprotected and vulnerable if an issue arises. Do not under any circumstances buy gift cards for payment at the request of a seller. Go with your gut! If something comes across as odd or different, don’t assume it’s safe simply because it’s Amazon! Online shopping should generally be a simple, seamless shopping experience. This is exactly the type of convenient, no hassle experience that has gotten Amazon to be the online retail juggernaut that they are today. While we are in the midst of the busiest shopping season of the year, it’s important to be aware of the potential dangers that can exist, even when shopping from the most trusted retailers. If something feels off, it probably is. Don’t ignore the signs and you can ensure a safe and happy holiday shopping season this year and for many years to come! Source",

Potter's artistic and literary interests were deeply influenced by fairies, fairy tales and fantasy. Her best known picture book is The Tale of Peter Rabbit which was also her first publication.

      "text": "We're only two episodes in to Clarkson, Hammond and May's new Amazon Prime-hosted motoring show The Grand Tour, and there have already been a number of deaths. Don't worry, the maverick trio are just fine, but their celebrity guests haven't fared too well. Jeremy Renner (skydiving), Armie Hammer (snake) and Charlize Theron (lion) have all already met their 'end' on the show, and that's before we get to Carol Vorderman's brief and bizarre cameo. So, with such an unsavoury track record, which celebs are Clarkson, Hammond and May hoping to tempt on to the show for a death scene next? Well, if Clarkson gets his way, the next leader of the free world will be meeting his maker sooner rather than later. When questioned if he'd have Donald Trump as a guest on The Grand Tour, Clarkson told Digital Spy: \"God, yes. Have you seen what we're doing to everybody?\" So, how would president-elect Trump go? Well, according to Clarkson: \"It's up to [the celebrities] as to how they go. There are a lot of amusing ways, we live in interesting times.\" Chiming in on the matter, Richard Hammond added: \"I'm sure he'd be eager to volunteer.\" While The Grand Tour has audiences gripped, it's not the trio's only new post-BBC venture. Bringing the fight to the likes of Twitter, Facebook and Instagram, they've today, November 28, launched their new motoring themed social network, DRIVETRIBE. Letting users get the low down on all their favourite motoring interests in one place, DRIVETRIBE, as well as acting as another front for Clarkson-based rants, the network will see users able to create and follow themes, channels and discussion boards known as Tribes. According to James May: \"Motoring isn't niche and there are dedicated bits online about it, but they're a bit too niche in some sense. It's quite difficult to find them and hard to browse them.\" Discussing the benefits of DRIVETRIBE, he added: \"The way our Tribe system works means you can browse everything to do with cars that somebody, somewhere is interested enough in to create a Tribe.\" DRIVETRIBE, which is free to sign up to, is available online now. The Android and iOS apps will follow in the coming days. ",

      "text": "Dana Point, CA - November 28,\nPioneer video game developer Michael Cranford reenters the gaming arena with a role-playing game exclusively for the Amazon Alexa voice service. Cranford developed the hit game \"The Bard's Tale\" in the 80s, an interactive adventure in the early days of personal computers that set the stage for today's MMORPGs (massive multiplayer online role-playing games). Shadow Realm is the first in a series of products released by Days Fly, Inc., Cranford's application development company.\nLike Bard's Tale, Shadow Realm is a fantasy adventure where the user plays themselves in a world of magic, treasure, dragons, combat, and puzzles on their way to solving a great quest. The game is modeled on the rich storylines, adventure, interaction, and problem solving of his original games, but with a twist; the game is controlled using your voice, through one of Amazon's new devices.\n\"The Alexa voice service allows you to engage the world around you using your voice. But it's so much more,\" Cranford says. \"It's the thing that ties everything in your life together simply by talking. Entertainment and gaming are just one part of that. With Alexa, you and your family can sit in a common place and explore a world together. Picture the radio shows that your grandparents and great-grandparents grew up on, where they would sit enthralled every evening, using their imagination to experience the worlds that were brought to them by words. With Alexa, you can engage those worlds interactively and seamlessly, without logging into a screen. I'm developing new worlds to explore using words.\"\n\"With the Amazon Tap, you can bring Alexa with you anywhere. Soon this will be in everyone's car. You will be able to explore dungeons, cast magical spells, and solve riddles while you are driving around on the freeway, using only your voice. You'll be able to game with your friends as you are walking around, hands-free. This is going to be in schools, allowing kids to interact in a way that not only entertains them but also helps them develop a voice in today's world. I'm excited by the possibilities that Amazon has unlocked. We're developing numerous games and educational products for Alexa to be ready in early 2017.\"\nCranford has started a new company, Days Fly, Inc. (https://daysfly.com), to focus on development for Alexa. Days Fly will offer not only its own products, but the ability for third parties to license its game engine.\n\"Studios can release their movies as interactive adventures, with streaming voice clips and sound effects, so that people can interact with the characters and storylines. We can take a movie or television show or any other digital product, including a video game, and make it a voice-controlled interactive experience,\" Cranford states. \"Amazon is changing the world with these new devices. We're committed to making it happen.\"\nAbout Michael Cranford\nMichael Cranford was a pioneer in the early years of video game development. The Bard's Tale (1985) set the stage for computer-based RPG development on a larger scale and introduced numerous original ideas to the genre. Cranford has spent the last two decades doing web application development, and is published in academic journals such as Technology in Society and The Journal of Business Ethics . He received his Ph.D. in Social Ethics from the University of Southern California in 2007. Information about Cranford and Bard's Tale can be found on Wikipedia, and Alexa will also respond to the question, \"Alexa, who is Michael Cranford?\"\nAbout Shadow Realm\nThe Realm of Shadows is the first in a series of interactive role-playing games published by Days Fly, Inc. To play, all you need is a device that has the Alexa voice service. Say, \"Alexa, enable Shadow Realm,\" and the skill will be installed for you to play. The game saves your progress automatically as you go, so you can start and stop playing at any time. You say, \"Alexa, launch Shadow Realm\" when you are ready to pick up where you left off.\nThe Realm of Shadows is a fantasy adventure. You are a person from our time who is given the responsibility of protecting the land that has been in your family for generations. The bank is attempting to foreclose on the forest, hills and streams that are under your protection, and you are committed to saving them. On a casual evening stroll from your backyard, you find a magical doorway that leads deep beneath the roots of the forest, into a realm of magic and adventure. You are caught up on a quest to save the land - both in the magical world you enter, as well as the modern world you have left. The Land is under the control of Beira, the Stone Queen, and it has summoned you to become its champion against the forces of shadow. You face those who do the Stone Queen's bidding in a battle of wits, weaponry, and magic to rescue the Land and become the champion who is foretold of legend.\nAbout Days Fly, Inc.\nDays Fly is a natural language application development studio located in Dana Point, California, specializing in cloud-based applications for Amazon's Alexa web service.

      "text": "We've known Amazon has been deeply interested in recruiting authors and publishers to use its print-on-demand service ever since it used blackmail to compel publishers to sign up with BookSurge in 2008 (now known as CreateSpace).\nIn all that time I've only heard of the POD service being called either Createspace or Booksurge, but apparently Amazon is now distinguishing between Createspace and a second POD service.\nThe second service is called \"Amazon POD\" , and it is only open to publishers (*).\n\nAmazon POD has been around for at least a couple years, but it only crossed my desk this week when Mark Williams found the one public mention of it on Amazon.co.uk (I can't find it on Amazon.com).\nMark got bent out of shape over the fact that authors are excluded, but it's not clear that they are missing much.\nThe pages on Amazon's UK site revealed that Amazon POD covers the US, UK, Japan, and the Eurozone, and according to the contract (which was last updated in April 2015), Amazon POD has the exact same costs as Createspace ( source ).\nAmazon POD is run by CreateSpace (the contact email address is publishersupport@createspace.com), and there is in fact little to distinguish between the two, but Amazon is promising several benefits which authors might not be receiving through Createspace.\nBooks distributed through Amazon POD are eligible for Amazon Prime and next-day delivery, and if a publishers puts all of their titles through Amazon POD they can save 10% off their costs.\nSo who is using Amazon POD?\nAmazon says that a number of small publishers have signed up, including Packt, Head of Zeus, and Sage. They have also identified titles by Time Inc, Lake Union (an Amazon imprint), Cambridge university Press, and Palgrave Macmillan as having been distributed through the Amazon POD service.\nYes, Amazon said that a Big Five publisher is using Amazon POD.\nGiven their frequently contentious relationship, I was as surprised as you, but in a way it makes a lot of sense.\nThe real value of POD is that it eliminates storage costs. Publishers don't have to invest capital in a print run which might end up moldering away in a warehouse; instead the books are printed as needed.\nThis is ideal for backlist and other titles which are in low demand, so one would expect to see it used heavily in academic publishing where the print runs have already dipped into three digits.\nIf you know of a publisher who uses this program, let us know in the comments.\nI'm especially interested in first-hand reports. What did you think of it?\nYou just finished reading Is Anyone Using Amazon’s Other, Non-CreateSpace, POD Service? which was published on The Digital Reader . If you liked what you read, how about joining the discussion? ",

      "text": "Amazon \nIf this year's holiday quarter comes in as Amazon says it will, the company could hit $134 billion in annual sales. About $12 billion of that would come from its cloud, Amazon Web Services.\nAnd the cloud is really just getting started, AWS CEO Andy Jassy told the Seattle Times' Ángel González .\nWhen González asked Jassy if AWS could ever become the biggest business within Amazon, Jassy cautiously said it could (emphasis ours):\nIt would likely take time. But I do think it’s possible that in the fullness of time AWS could be the largest business in Amazon . Part of that is because, if you look at the market segments AWS addresses — infrastructure software, hardware, data center services, plus some capability to build further up stack as well — that’s trillions of dollars worldwide . It’s a very large opportunity and we’re very optimistic about where AWS will be in the long term.\nAmazon's cloud growth remains on a tear. On Monday, Amazon said that it had won yet another huge customer for its cloud, Matson the international shipping company. Matson has closed all four of its own data centers and moved all of its apps to Amazon's cloud, joining a growing list of companies who have done the same, going \"all-in\" with Amazon, in some cases nabbing those customers right out of cloud competitors' arms. \nNOW WATCH: JACK DANIEL’S MASTER DISTILLER: This is the real difference between scotch, whiskey, and bourbon \n",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray \nAs expected, the holiday shopping orgy that began on Thanksgiving in the U.S., continued with Black Friday , and runs through today, with “Cyber Monday,” is turning out to have been a better affair for online commerce outlets such as Amazon ( AMZN ) than it was for the brick-and-mortar proprietors.\nYou wouldn’t know if from the stock action today: Amazon is down $13.65, or 1.7%, at $766.72, while Wal-Mart Stores ( WMT ) shares are also down, off 8 cents at $71.15.\nThe trade group National Retail Federation reports , based on a survey conducted with the help of Prosper Insights & Analytics, that the number of shoppers in the U.S. from Thanksgiving through Sunday was up slightly, at 154 million versus 151 million a year ago, and that “when it comes to where consumers shopped over the weekend, the survey found that 44 percent went online and 40 percent shopped in-store.” Shopping was most “popular” for online shoppers on Black Friday, which is when 74% of them did their shopping.\nThe firm projects that “122 million Americans plan to shop online on Cyber Monday, up from the 121 million who planned to participate last year.”\nPutting together some of the data points, Roxanne Meyer , a “softlines” retail analyst for MKM Partners , who follows traditional retailers, notes that Urban Outfitters ( URBN ) and Lululemon Athletica ( LULU ) were among shops that had increased promotional activities this year versus the shopping season last year. They in many cases started with discounting on Tuesday or Wednesday of last week and continued right through the weekend.\nHowever, the NRF and Comscore data show that online shopping continued to steal sales from traditional retail:\nWhile the tone of NRF’s survey was upbeat, putting together a 2% increase in traffic and 3% decline in transaction value translates into a sales decline for the holiday weekend vs. LY. Fewer consumers said they shopped traditional stores: department stores: 50.9% (vs. 54% LY), discount stores: 34.2% (37% LY), and clothing stores: 28.4% (32% LY). On the other hand, fewer consumers both started and finished holiday shopping vs. this time LY, which could bode well for the weeks ahead. More consumers spent online (44%) vs. in stores (40%), which is not surprising. Adobe noted that Black Friday total e-commerce sales rose 21.6% YOY, with mobile up 33%, while comScore reported that sales rose 12% from Nov 1-25, and rose 19% on Black Friday. \nMeyer’s colleague following Wal-Mart, Patrick McKeever , writes that Black Friday was “dud” for Wal-Mart and others:\nWe visited stores last night and this morning and came away generally underwhelmed, as Thanksgiving evening store traffic at our biggest “Black Friday” players, Walmart, Target and Kohl’s, looked down vs. LY (ballpark estimate would be 15%-20%), and Black Friday morning seemed like a complete dud, with an overall feel more like a typical weekend day (handful of registers open, short lines), not a big-time sales event. That said, we believe the holiday season is off to an Ok start, it’s just that sales continue to migrate online, which makes it increasingly difficult to decipher the winners and losers. On a relative basis, we did think Target looked better than Walmart, both last night and this morning, and this seemed to be supported by the companies’ press releases — Target’s sounded more upbeat than Walmart’s. Kohl’s actually had the longest lines, but that’s been true in the past and hasn’t always been predictive. Also, the lines appeared shorter than LY, both last night and this morning. Bottom line, we’re not ready to make any big holiday stock calls just yet.",

      "text": "Artsploitation Films // Unrated // October 18, 2016 List Price: Unknown [Buy now and save at Amazon ] Review by Olie Coen | posted November 28, 2016 | E-mail the Author Director: Victor Matellano Starring: Veronica Polo, Christian Stamm, Marta Flich Year: 2015 When lesbian vampires are the base of the premise for your movie, you know you've done something ...right? I mean, of course that's ridiculous, but it's actually so insane that it just might work, one of those campy ideas that's so incredibly stupid it might just be genius. And this concept has been carried out before to cult success, in Joseph Larraz' original 1974 version of Vampyres by the same name, a much-loved horror flick that doesn't pretend to be the next great Oscar winner. What's funny is that these women aren't really lesbians, nor are they strictly vampires, but rather some odd, sexual, undead, mash up of legends and fears and fantasies. I hope this introduction successfully prepares you for the oddity of this movie, but also for the potential for fun inherent to its plot; how much or how little enjoyment you get from it by the end being absolutely unpredictable. The Movie When Harriet and her friends decide to camp near an abandoned chateau in the woods, they may experience more than they bargained for. They only wanted to pitch a tent, commune with the surroundings, write some prose, delve into a little history, but when a pair of their compatriots don't show up on schedule, they begin to wonder if the area is as safe as they assumed. Soon, Harriet is seeing wandering figures, conversing with a panicked man, and fearing for the lives of her friends, as the terror of the house and its inhabitants begins to soak into her very soul. This strange man who stumbled across the camp may hold the key to whatever is happening here, if only he survives long enough to share it. The mysterious man, Ted, had been staying at a local hotel before venturing into the woods, in search of who knows what. But he's found something exciting, although not altogether safe. He meets a beautiful and suspiciously casual woman named Fran who claims the old house as her own, saying that she's living there with a friend named Miriam. The two are close, and often have friends over for dinner. Well, Ted is about to find out exactly what these vague terms mean first hand, something that will not be very pleasure. Not that there won't be perks; two open-minded, voluptuous women are two open-minded, voluptuous women after all. But the death count will rise sooner rather than later, you can count on that. I'm not sure where to start, and I have to admit that I haven't seen the 1974 original, although I have stumbled across several Jesus Franco films, so I'm fairly accustomed to these Spanish directors and their penchant for boobs and blood. There is a certain enjoyable atmosphere to this genre, a certain disregard for the conventional and a complete reckless abandon that's rather refreshing. They want blood pouring out into a bath, they get blood pouring out into a bath. They want a threesome with two insatiable vampires, they get a threesome with two insatiable vampires. These filmmakers deny themselves nothing, and that actually works to the film's benefit, allowing it to be as insane as it wants, letting us love it anyway. Now, I'll stop before calling this film a masterpiece, because it is absolutely anything but. The story makes very little sense, the characters are ridiculous, the acting is terrible, the sets are boring, even the nudity is mediocre, and I doubt there's a single element you could pull out and call great. No, the quality of this movie lies within its inherent style, the ability to jump the shark without a look down to see where you might land. It takes balls to make something so silly, especially a remake of something that was already so silly, to a potentially famous point, at least in an underground sense. As long as you know what you're in for, there's an entertaining air here, at least for those who have already bought into the genre. The DVD Video: With an aspect ratio of 2.35:1, the video quality of this film is minimally adequate. It's not as grainy or poor as its 70s counterparts, but it's also nothing vivid and wonderful to excite comment. At least the blood, death, sex, and action scenes were done with acceptable amounts of gore and style, so the picture quality itself becomes a moot point. Audio: The DVD was done in English 5.1 Surround, with an option of 2.0 Stereo. Subtitles are available in English, English SDH, and Spanish. The audio quality of the film is about as lackluster as the video, though the background music is at least something interesting. Otherwise, the sound quality is fine but not wonderful, and won't stand out. Extras: There are a few special features on the disc. Making of Vampyres is a 12-minute behind-the-scenes segment. Interview with Caroline Munro is a 3-minute sit down with the actress, a veteran of 70s and 80s camp. Lastly, there are seven trailers available: Vampyres, Fever, The Perfect Husband, Observance, The Fostering, Counter Clockwise, Der Bunker . Final Thoughts Rent It . Did you watch the original? Do you like Victor Matellano, Jesus Franco, and that ilk? Have you surreptitiously enjoyed your fair share of low budget horror flicks where the only positives to look forward to are copious amounts of red-dyed goop and pale hippie bosoms? Well then, this one's for you, and don't feel embarrassed about having some simple fun watching some simple garbage. This genre was made for a reason, and you can be assured that you're not the only one who has imbibed from time to time. Hell, I have myself, and there's something to be said for a film that harbors no pretentious whims whatsoever. The video here is forgettable, the audio passable, but there are a few extras if you're thirsty for more. All in all, a good time easily spent, with no quality to speak of, but absolutely zero shits given. \nOlie Coen",

      "title": "The Fight Is Rigged in Death of X #4",
      "text": "Amazon \nIf a fight is rigged and rigged well, then it’s usually hard to tell which side has the advantage. Those fights can be quite entertaining, as the success of WWE wrestling routinely demonstrates. When the rigging is too obvious, though, the entertainment value suffers. It’s just not very fun or interesting when it’s easy to tell who’s getting an extra shot of Hulk blood on the side. \nThis is the biggest flaw in the Death of X narrative. It isn’t a passionate disagreement between Iron Man and Captain America over methods for administering justice. It’s a cage match between one side that has the unconditional backing of Disney’s lawyers and another that remains under the boot of a rival company. The X-men and the Inhumans are not on a level playing field and haven’t been since Marvel Studios began churning out billion-dollar blockbusters on a regular basis. \nThis means there’s little to no suspense in the outcome of Death of X #4 . It’s a foregone conclusion that the X-men will lose, the Inhumans will come out on top, and the lawyers negotiating movie rights will keep getting billed by the hour. It gives Charles Soule and Jeff Lemire a poor foundation to build on, but it’s a foundation that can still fill in some unresolved issues. They just have to build carefully because they don’t want to give the X-men more reasons to resort to clones and time travel. \nThere’s a genuine effort to extract every ounce of drama from this final issue, but there’s not much worth extracting here. There’s a distinct absence of detail and polish to the overall story. It doesn’t complete the narrative that began in the first issue, nor does it fill in the blanks left by the various X-men titles that spun out of Secret Wars. There is some intrigue. There are some heated, passionate moments. It doesn’t fall flat, but it does feel distinctly incomplete. \nIf there is a defining moment in Death of X #4 , it manifests during the confrontation between Cyclops and the Inhumans royal family. This moment feels very much like a trailer of sorts, complete with ominous warnings and angry pleas. The trailer may lack the star power of Hugh Jackman or Sir Patrick Stewart, but it effectively ensures that there will be a war between the Inhumans and the X-men. It’s not just inevitable at this point. It’s overdue. \nWhile this moment is vital in giving Death of X #4 the necessary impact, it’s pretty much the only moment that’s memorable or impactful in any way. Every other moment throughout the narrative is either lacking in substance or devoid of style. There’s little else in terms of drama. None of that drama feels like an emotional gut punch either. For a comic where a major character dies, that’s pretty telling. \nIt’s also the most frustrating aspect about Death of X #4 and the X-men comics as a whole since Secret Wars . The lack of drama and the lack of details ensures this story adds little context to the overall narrative surrounding the X-men. Much of that narrative is crafted around this idea that Cyclops did something so horrific and so despicable that it would make James Marsden violently ill if someone said it out loud. That idea, however, becomes exceedingly complicated here. \nIt’s not just because Soule and Lemire try to throw in a twist at the end that effectively ensures that Cyclops can die with some credibility intact. It’s also because the sequence of events that unfold throughout Death of X do little to warrant such an idea. There’s no overt atrocity here. Cyclops doesn’t suddenly become Thanos, Victor Von Doom, or whoever canceled the last X-men cartoon. He does what he and the X-men always do and tries to protect innocent mutants. \nThis draws the ire of the Inhuman royal family for reasons that are understandable, albeit petty. However, it’s worth emphasizing here that what Cyclops does, be it overt or indirect, can’t qualify as an atrocity. He doesn’t kill anyone. He doesn’t destroy anything. He doesn’t even make a joke about Medusa’s hair. There really is nothing here that warrants the hatred and disdain that is so prominent in the current X-men comics. \nIf there are any unforeseen consequences to Cyclops’ actions, they aren’t revealed. They aren’t even hinted at. What Cyclops does simply prevents a cloud of Terrigen Mist from descending upon a populated area and killing every innocent mutant in its path. No human or Inhuman dies as a result. In fact, only one other person dies and that person dies willingly in a heroic sacrifice that the Inhuman royal family tried to prevent. \nIn terms of a balanced, albeit rigged, conflict, the entertainment value really suffers here. Death of X does little to create even the illusion of balance between mutants and Inhumans. If anything, it only shows that the Inhuman royal family is disturbingly comfortable with letting an entire minority suffer horribly so that their own race can propagate. While Cyclops made it clear to them that he was just as comfortable letting the Inhumans stagnate, there’s little effort to have a passionate, balanced discussion. \nIn terms of the bigger picture surrounding the X-men/Inhuman conflict, Death of X #4 has too many blanks to fill and not nearly enough ink to make a concerted effort. It does what it can, but not much else. There’s a sense of rhythm and flow to the narrative. It never becomes too chaotic and it avoids completely denigrating certain characters, although there will likely be a certain segment of fans that will passionately disagree on message boards. There’s a sense that this story is part of a much larger narrative that has yet to unfold. \nDeath of X #4 doesn’t read like the end of an event so it’s not going to check every box before the final page. While it manages to be coherent and revealing in some respects, it still comes off as woefully incomplete. If it were a school project, it couldn’t be adequately graded because it doesn’t present a finished product. This may be okay for a movie trailer, but for a complete story that kills off one of the most iconic X-men in history, it’s not even close to being enough.

And, customers asked Alexa nearly 3x as many questions about cooking during Thanksgiving week compared to the week prior,” Amazon wrote in a statement shared with VentureBeat.\nThe spokesperson did not share just how many questions people asked Alexa-enabled devices but said questions and commands increased 356 percent this Thanksgiving compared to Thanksgiving last year.\nAlexa users were more interested in things like music than they were interested in turkey prep or pie recipes.\nThe top five Thanksgiving Day questions and requests:\n“Alexa, what time is it?”\n“Alexa, tell me a joke.”\n“Alexa, play Christmas music.”\n“Alexa, what’s the weather?”\n“Alexa, tell me a Thanksgiving joke.”\nAlexa owners asked for “upbeat, dance tracks for their gatherings with family and friends,” the statement said.\nThe five most requested songs were:\n“Jingle Bells”\n“Juju on that Beat” by Zay Hilfigerrr and Zayion McCall\n“Alice’s Restaurant” by Arlo Guthrie\n“Can’t Stop the Feeling” by Justin Timberlake\n“Uptown Funk” by Bruno Mars and Mark Ronson\nThe five most requested holiday songs were:\n“Jingle Bells”\n“Jingle Bell Rock”\n“The Christmas Song”\n“It’s the Most Wonderful Time of the Year”\n“Feliz Navidad”\nIn the days prior to Thanksgiving, Amazon announced that it has sold more than 5 million devices since Amazon Echo was first announced in late 2014.\n",

      "text": "Due to several lawsuits and criticism, Amazon has known the problem since a long time now, but have been largely silent on the issue, which has, in turn, led to a cost increase for brands and sellers.(Reuters) World’s biggest online retailer, Amazon has long been suffering from the problem of fake products on its e-commerce marketplace. Recently, tech major Apple had pointed out that most of the iPhone and iPad charging cables and adapters available on Amazon’s website were fake, even if the sellers claim them to be real. The case of counterfeit products went so far ahead that Apple went on to file a lawsuit against Mobile Star, a supplier to Amazon and had accused the company of trademark and copyright infringement, according to Patently Apple. Due to several lawsuits and criticism, Amazon has known the problem since a long time now, but have been largely silent on the issue, which has, in turn, led to a cost increase for brands and sellers, Bloomberg reported.\nThe global e-commerce giant has reportedly decided to take action against scammers with and aim to clean up its marketplace. According to Bloomberg news, Amazon has made it a ‘major goal’ for the next year ti tackle the fake products issue as it has realised that the problem of counterfeit products have been growing exponentially. The company is said to make a register to avoid fake products brands will be working with the website even if they do not sell their products there. “Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” Amazon said in a statement. Amazon added that it is “aggressively pursuing bad actors.”\nAlso read | Amazon’s ugly truth: 90 percent Apple power products fake; Here’s all about the lawsuit\nMarketplace merchants will now have to get permission for the brands before the can sell products on Amazon. Amazon reportedly had been trying out the process with Nike and a few others, but by next year it will be aggressive towards building the registry and target more and more brands so that they could sell their products on the website.",

      "text": "Related Content View Photo This loophole lets you give 5% of Amazon purchases to charity—for free\nSend 5% from every purchase to charity—for free. Source: Reuters This Giving Tuesday people are donating millions to charity. But did you know there’s a way to do it that doesn’t cost you a penny? \nFor a few years now, Amazon has had a program that sends 0.5% of cash you spend to charity. It’s called Amazon Smile, and once you set it up (it’s easy, you just decide which charity) you visit the Smile homepage instead of the Amazon one and the company ( AMZN ) gives 50 cents for every $100 you spend to your chosen organization. \nThat’s better than a hot stick in the eye, but it might not offer enough benefit to force you to start your shopping from the special webpage, even if you bookmarked it. \nBut would a solid 5% motivate you? \nAs Vox noted last year , there’s a loophole that you can exploit to have Amazon funnel $5 of every $100 you spend to charity at no cost to you. \nAs you probably know, websites can partner with Amazon, linking to their products in exchange for a commission—and (you guessed it) that commission is around 5%. Taking advantage of this very referral tool ( it’s available to pretty much anyone ), a Canadian charity foundation called Shop for Charity set up an account. \nInstead of pocketing the money it receives from its “affiliate links” as they’re called, Shop for Charity donates all of its Amazon checks to deworming efforts through the Schistosomiasis Control Initiative . Deworming is extremely cost effective and make an enormous difference per dollar , and there’s a great need. Hundreds of millions of children are impaired by soil-borne worms, and the treatment is simple and cost-effective, at around $1.25 per child. \nTo take advantage of this scheme, you can add “?tag=charity48-20” to the end of the URL when you found the item you want to buy, or simply start your shopping at “ Amazon.com?tag=charity48-20 .” If you save the latter link as your Amazon bookmark, and use it for any and all your Amazon purchases, those dollars will add up quickly. \nEthan Wolff-Mann is a writer at Yahoo Finance focusing on consumerism, tech, and personal finance.

      "title": "Amazon to Unveil New Premium Echo With 7-inch Touchscreen?",
      "text": "MORE Posted 9 minutes ago by iClarified · 306 views · Translate Amazon is reportedly working on a new premium version of its Echo digital assistant that features a touchscreen about 7-inches in size, reports Bloomberg.The company's current Alexa devices rely on voice commands to access content. The new device will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news. The latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. High-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon could unveil the new Echo by the first quarter of 2017. It would join the existing Echo , Echo Dot , and Echo Tap lineup of devices.",

Staff Writer, Greenbot | November 29, 2016 Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: LeEco 23% off MagicFiber Microfiber Cleaning Cloths For Screens and Other Delicate... \nLeEco is hardly a household name in the United States, but it’s doing everything it can to change that. At its wild launch event in October, the relatively unknown (in the west) company unveiled a pair of Android smartphones—along with a line of TVs, VR headset, smart bicycle streaming service, self-driving electric car, and a partridge in a pear tree—designed to be the center of a new mobile ecosystem. But until now, anyone who wanted a phone had to be fast enough to catch it during one of the flash sales at LeMall.com. \nStarting Dec. 1, it’ll be a whole lot easier to buy one. For one, LeEco is lifting the restrictions at LeMall, so buyers won’t have to be so quick on the trigger, but more importantly, the $249 Le S3 and $399 Le Pro3 will also be available online at Amazon, Best Buy, and Target. And to sweeten the deal for would-be purchasers, the company has partnered with DirecTV to offer three months of its newly unveiled Now streaming service with any purchase. \nWhy this matters: Chinese phone makers face long odds when trying to penetrate the U.S., and it remains to be seen if LeEco’s push will be fruitful. But getting major retail visibility for its phones during the holiday shopping season could be a boon for the fledgling OEM, despite some less-than-stellar first impressions.

Amazon Orders 'Bug Diaries'&'Sigmund & The Sea Monsters' Kids Series \nHe’ll play the mysterious figure tied to the Resistance movement who collects the enigmatic films that seem to depict alternate versions of reality — the ones the Japanese and Nazis want to find and destroy. Watch a clip of his character above. \nSeason 2, which starts streaming December 16, picks up with political tensions mounting between Germany and Japan. Juliana Crain (Alexa Davalos) facing the consequences of her decision to betray the Resistance and allow Joe Blake (Luke Kleintank), a suspected Nazi agent, to escape the Pacific States with a film originally bound for the Man in the High Castle. Joe returns a hero to the Reich and finds himself thrust into the Nazi capital of Berlin, face to face with the father who abandoned him. Meanwhile, Frank Frink (Rupert Evans) becomes increasingly radicalized and drawn further into the Resistance after seeing images of his own execution in the mysterious films. DJ Qualls, Joel de la Fuente, Brennan Brown, Bella Heathcote, Callum Keith Rennie, Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa and Rufus Sewell co-star. \nVeteran actor Root has appeared in dozens of films as Selma , Trumbo , Boardwalk Empire and Finding Dory and played Milton in the cult classic Office Space.

      "text": "How to Install the Google Play Store on the Amazon Fire HD 8 \nAmazon’s slightly-larger Fire HD 8 tablet is a bit more expensive than the entry-level Fire Tablet , but it comes with a faster processor and a higher-resolution display that’s well worth the cost. However, it still comes with the same Fire OS interface and restrictions that only give you access to the Amazon Appstore. Here’s how to install the Google Play Store on the newer Fire HD 8 and get access to a lot more apps and games. RELATED ARTICLE \nThis method doesn’t require rooting the device, nor does it require a PC to do the legwork—everything is done right on the tablet itself. Before You Begin \nMake sure that your Fire HD 8 is on version 5.3.1.1 and not the latest 5.3.2. You can check what version you have by going into Settings > Device Options > System Updates and looking at the version number at the top of the screen. This might work on 5.3.2, but no one has tested it publicly yet, so do it at your own risk if you’re on the latest version. However, I updated my tablet to 5.3.2 after I installed the Google Play Store and it still works fine—we’re just not sure if installing it while on 5.3.2 would work. (If you try it and it works, let us know in the comments and we’ll update this article!) \nAlso, go into Settings > Security and enable “Apps from Unknown Sources”. This will allow you to install the necessary APK files that will give you the Google Play Store. Step One: Download the Google Play Store APK Files RELATED ARTICLE How to Sideload Apps onto Your Kindle Fire \nNext, there are four .APK files you’ll need to download, using the built-in Silk browser on your tablet. The easiest way to do this is to open up this tutorial in the Silk browser and click on the links below, which will take you to the download pages. These come from APK Mirror, an established and trustworthy source for Android APKs. \nGoogle Play Store APK \nTo download each APK file, click on the link, scroll down, and tap on “Download APK”. \nThe download will start shortly. When it does, a pop-up will appear saying that this type of file can harm your device (don’t worry—it won’t). Tap on “OK” when the pop-up appears. \nAfter each file downloads, do the same thing for the next APK file until all four files are downloaded. Step Two: Install the Google Play Store APK Files \nClose out of the Silk browser and open up the built-in file manager app on your Fire table called “Docs”. \nTap on “Local Storage”. \nSelect the “Downloads” folder. \nYour APK files will appear in this folder. Simply tap on one to begin installing it. Be sure to install the APK files in the order that you downloaded them from the list above. In other words, install the Google Account Manager APK first, then the Google Services Framework APK, followed by the Google Play Services APK, and then the Google Play Store APK to finish it out. \nOn the next screen, confirm the installation by tapping on “Install” at the bottom. Toward the upper-left corner it will say which APK you’re installing, so again, make sure you install them in the right order. \nRepeat this process for each APK file until all four are installed. Once that’s done, the Google Play Store app will appear on the home screen of your Fire HD 8 tablet. Open it up, log in with your Google account, and download some apps! \nThanks to Gilly10 on the XDA-Developers forums for providing this method.

      "text": "Amazon’s Takeover Of The Economy Is The Real Threat To American Jobs Donald Trump’s got his eye on the wrong ball. 11/29/2016 03:17 pm ET Emily Peck Executive Editor, Business and Technology, The Huffington Post Ralph Freso/Reuters Amazon's massive warehouses have essentially displaced brick-and-mortar retailers around the country. \nAmazon’s stranglehold on the U.S. economy is growing ever tighter, with devastating effects for the job market, says a report released Tuesday afternoon. \nThe group’s wide-ranging analysis details how Amazon, which recently saw annual revenue top a stunning $100 billion , has reshaped the way Americans shop and radically altered the job market. \nAfter years of undercutting other retailers by selling products at a loss , funneling its customers into its super-convenient Prime service and ― essentially ― perfecting the art of online retail, Amazon is now synonymous with online shopping itself. \nTaking into account goods sold through third-party retailers on its site, nearly $1 of every $2 spent online currently flows through Amazon, the report found. That’s had devastating consequences for retailers who simply can’t compete ― both online and out in the real world (remember Borders?). \nAbout 149,000 jobs have been lost as Amazon’s business has expanded, according to the analysis from the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which advocates for fair, sustainable local economies. \nAmazon declined to comment on the report. In a letter to shareholders this year, the company claimed that its Marketplace, where third-party sellers offer up goods, has created 600,000 jobs. It’s unclear what kind of jobs these are, however. ILSR \nDonald Trump got himself elected, in part, by talking about how American jobs shifted overseas as factories closed up shop and moved abroad. That’s a process that began decades ago and, most economists would concede, has largely already rippled through the country with heartbreaking effects. Now, Amazon’s growing business poses a similar kind of threat. \n“I have a hard time seeing the company as anything less than a new wave of economic dislocation on par with the earlier collapse of manufacturing and small businesses that devastated so many regions of the country,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute and one of the report’s co-authors. \nYet Trump so far has mainly confined his criticism of Amazon mostly to jabs at CEO Jeff Bezos (who has also publicly criticized Trump) and some pointed comments about how the retailer avoids paying taxes and famously doesn’t prioritize profit-making, choosing instead to push growth. The @washingtonpost , which loses a fortune, is owned by @JeffBezos for purposes of keeping taxes down at his no profit company, @amazon . — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 7, 2015 \nMost Amazon customers have already made the tradeoff between in-person service and the slick convenience the shopping site provides. And, of course, technological advancement in the retail space isn’t solely Amazon’s province. \nHowever its utter dominance has had wide-ranging consequences. The researchers point out some other downsides to Amazon’s takeover of retailers, including fewer new products getting created or new businesses starting up. \nThe growing popularity of online shopping also translates into store closures. The report’s authors say that Amazon has, so far, caused more than 135 million square feet of retail space to become vacant. That’s “the equivalent of about 700 empty big-box stores plus 22,000 shuttered Main Street businesses,” they write. Mike Segar/Reuters Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos recently surpassed Warren Buffet as the second-richest man in the world. \nOverall, you don’t need as many people to sell goods online as you do to sell stuff in the real world. Brick-and-mortar retailers with the same sales as Amazon would employ 294,574 people, the researchers estimate using Census data. Amazon employs just 145,800 people. And the jobs the company has created at its warehouses often pay less than comparable work, according to the report. \nThe company pays its fulfillment workers an average of 15 percent less than the prevailing wage for comparable work in 11 metro areas where Amazon has a significant presence, the report finds. ILSR Amazon hasn't created as many jobs as it's displaced. \nThe company also relies on a growing number of temporary workers to fulfill customer orders and those jobs don’t provide the kind of benefits or simply the stability of a full-time job. In October, Amazon announced it was hiring 120,000 seasonal workers. The rub: These jobs are expected to eventually be displaced by automation, something Amazon has been particularly keen on exploring. \n“Amazon appears to be aiming for a future in which it employs few workers and instead relies on machines and a bench of on-demand freelancers,” the authors write. \nThe company’s labor model is also impacting traditional package delivery companies ― UPS and the Postal service must now compete with Amazon, which is developing alternate delivery methods. The company’s low-wage, precarious labor model threatens the jobs of nearly 1 million unionized, middle-income workers at UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, the authors write. ILSR The report says Amazon pays lower than average wages in many areas. \nMuch of the information in the new report has been detailed elsewhere ― the grueling work at Amazon’s fulfillment centers ; the hard-charging atmosphere for even its white collar workers; the cutthroat tactics that led Amazon to crush competitors like Zappos and Diapers.com before eventually buying them. \nBut the researchers also offer up interesting analysis about how Amazon relies on local tax subsidies to fuel its growth. The company has gotten at least $613 million in subsidies since 2005, according to the report. Yet, at the same time its online retail business leads to brick-and-mortar store closures, which can ultimately deprive a locality of much-needed property tax revenue. Meanwhile, in some states the company still doesn’t charge shoppers sales tax. More:",

      "text": "Markets Today Amazon Is Reportedly Developing a New Echo Digital Assistant With a Touchscreen The e-commerce giant could be developing an Alexa-powered assistant that has a 7-inch touchscreen for certain types of interactions. Annie Palmer Nov29,20162:59PMEST \nIn a move to capitalize on the success of the Echo and Echo Dot, Amazon ( AMZN ) could release a new Echo-like speaker in 2017 that features a 7-inch touchscreen, sources told Bloomberg . \nThe device would still operate using Amazon's voice-activated Alexa software, but would have a large screen to make the weather, news and other items easily accessible. The screen will be able to tilt upwards and packs better speakers than the current Echo models, according to Bloomberg. \nThe new Echo device is expected to be pricier than the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers, which go for $50, $130 and $150, respectively. The new device will use a version of the Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box, the sources said, according to Bloomberg . \nA touch-based device might seem like somewhat of a step backward, however, with all the buzz around voice activated technology, said Werner Goertz, an analyst at market research firm Gartner. Plus, Amazon's Alexa software isn't exactly a \"match made in heaven\" for its Fire OS, Goertz noted. \nThe Fire OS is currently optimized for use on its Fire HD8 tablet, which makes it operate somewhat clumsily since the HD8 is on par with most e-readers, Goertz said. \nThat said, a touchscreen voice assistant would help with tasks that require more complex processes, such as ordering a plane ticket. \n\"If you think of a tablet that provides a use-case where multiple options are given, tactile would add to that,\" Goertz noted. \"Voice is not as good at that.\" Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Best-Ever Holiday Shopping Weekend for Amazon Devices—Top-Selling Products Across all Categories on Amazon were Echo Dot, Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, Fire Tablet, and Amazon Echo Millions of Echo Dot devices sold since launch—sales of Amazon Echo family of devices up more than 7x over last year’s Cyber Monday Sales of Amazon Fire TV devices up over 2.5x this Cyber Monday—continues to be the #1 streaming media player family in the U.S. across all retailers Fire Tablets sales up 2x this Cyber Monday—best holiday shopping weekend ever for Fire Kids Edition November 29, 2016 04:05 PM   \nSEATTLE- (NASDAQ: AMZN)—Amazon today announced its best-ever holiday shopping weekend for devices—including a record-breaking Cyber Monday with Amazon device sales up more than 2x over last year and millions of devices sold. \nEcho Dot, Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, Fire tablet, and Amazon Echo were not only the best-selling Amazon devices, but they were the best-selling products from any manufacturer in any category across all of Amazon. Millions of the all-new Echo Dot sold since launch—sales of Amazon Echo family of devices up over 7x over last year’s Cyber Monday. Millions of Alexa devices were purchased this holiday shopping weekend. Fire Tablets sales were up 2x compared to last Cyber Monday. Fire Kids Edition has its best holiday shopping weekend ever—continues to be the #1 kids tablet in the U.S., across all retailers. Amazon Fire TV sales were up more than 2.5x year-over-year on Cyber Monday. Fire TV continues to be the #1 streaming media player in the U.S., across all retailers. The Kindle e-reader business continues to grow—customers bought hundreds of thousands of Kindle e-readers this holiday weekend. \n“Customers purchased millions of Amazon’s Alexa-enabled devices this holiday weekend—the all-new Echo Dot, the best-selling 7” Fire tablet, and the new Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote are all available for under $50 and all powered by Alexa,” said Dave Limp, Senior Vice President, Amazon Devices & Services. “It’s never been easier to have Alexa in any or every room, and we’re excited for millions of new customers to discover Alexa this holiday season.” \nMany Amazon device customers already enjoyed using Alexa this holiday weekend, as well as other festive Amazon content on their devices: Alexa helped customers prep and cook for their Thanksgiving gatherings. Customers asked Alexa to set nearly 2x as many timers on Thanksgiving Day as the day before, and customers asked Alexa nearly 3x as many questions about cooking during Thanksgiving week compared to the week prior. The top 3 most popular Kindle cookbooks downloaded during Thanksgiving week include: “Essential Spices and Herbs,” “The Healthy Pressure Cooker Cookbook,” and “Me, Myself and Pie.” Customers listened to 40% more Amazon Music on Alexa devices than any other device on Thanksgiving. The top playlist on Alexa devices for Thanksgiving was “Thanksgiving with the Family;” the following day, “Christmas Classics” became the #1 playlist. Prime Video’s hit new show “The Grand Tour” was the most streamed title on Thanksgiving Day, followed by “Goliath.” The most popular holiday titles viewed on Amazon Video on Thanksgiving Day include “Christmas Vacation” and “Charlie Brown Christmas.” \nAbout Amazon \nAmazon is guided by four principles: customer obsession rather than competitor focus, passion for invention, commitment to operational excellence, and long-term thinking. Customer reviews, 1-Click shopping, personalized recommendations, Prime, Fulfillment by Amazon, AWS, Kindle Direct Publishing, Kindle, Fire tablets, Fire TV, Amazon Echo, and Alexa are some of the products and services pioneered by Amazon.

      "text": "Report: Next-Gen Echo to Feature Large Touchscreen   Tom Dawson \nSome time ago now, Amazon introduced us all to the Echo, and perhaps more importantly Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers the whole show. As for the hardware that gave Alexa her first home, the Amazon Echo was a Bluetooth speaker that would also connect to your home network and provide you with answer to all sorts of things, as well as offer up home automation, too. They’ve just been on sale for Black Friday, and now have all kinds of integrations to offer much better control of connected devices and allow you to do more than ever with nothing more than just your voice. This being Amazon, however, it doesn’t appear as though the original formula of the Echo is going to stay the same for long. \nA report from Bloomberg states that the next version of the Echo might feature a large touchscreen, perhaps as big as 7-inches. This isn’t the first time that such a device has been heard of, with it being rumored much earlier in the year with the codename of “Knight”. Bloomberg, in their report, is citing someone familiar with the matter, and while they didn’t want to be named they also mused about “high-grade” speakers to be included in the new Echo, too. For Amazon, such a device is likely a better way of them further controlling the home. Hardware such as the original Kindle and their range of Fire tablets have kept their brand in the minds of millions of customers, as well as guaranteeing a steady stream of income, too. The Echo furthered this, by making it easy to purchase things from the online store, but by opening Alexa up to everyone and anyone, they’ve got a solid platform on their hands, one that users appears to be quite fond of. \nWith the Google Home now making its way into people’s living rooms and kitchens, a touchscreen Echo, perhaps with some rudimentary apps could make such a speaker more familiar to users that feel uncomfortable talking to a speaker, or just want some visual feedback to go along with their commands. Either way, the fight for the connected home is getting more and more fierce, and while Amazon has been in the lead a little longer, Google won’t be content to leave it to their rival, leaving Amazon little choice but to push ahead with new and improved products.

      "text": "Using an IP Address to Point to Amazon S3 Storage (the sarcastic tone in rmalayter's answer prompted me to ask this) \nI understand I'm not the only one questioning this IP obsession. \nWhatever the scenario, there is usually a way, but what gets me, is that this often gets requested to please one client's IT department. It has nothing to do with improving the product. \n(I can accept it when they require an IP address for our servers to interact with their API for example, but sometimes it seems they just want something to whitelist before they start using a service that is accessible to the general public) \nOften this even hinders future architecture improvements since we can no longer freely add our AWS Lego blocks as needed. \nIs it right to give in and find a way to get your static IP address? \nOr should one dive into a rant about how 'the cloud' works in the hopes to confuse the \"IT department\" enough that they accept not having an IP address to whitelist? (this has worked before). \nIs there an answer that can get the most \"security aware\" operations teams to back away while still being friendly.",

      "title": "Swimming with the shark: Can startups stay alive with Amazon eating the world? | #reInvent - SiliconANGLE (blog)",
      "text": "by R. DANES UPDATED 02:32 EST . 30 November 2016 2 MIN READ \nThis may be the best of times and the worst of times for technology startups. Cloud infrastructure as a service is making it easier and cheaper than ever for entrepreneurs and developers to set up shop and roll their products out to market. Amazon Web Services provides practically everything a company needs to run their applications. Which begs the question: Why wouldn’t the startups’ customers just use Amazon too? \nAt the kickoff to AWS re:Invent, Stu Miniman ( @stu ) and John Furrier ( @furrier ), co-hosts of theCUBE*, from the SiliconANGLE Media team, discussed just that during the kickoff segment at the AWS re:Invent event. “You build the ecosystem, then you eat the ecosystem,” Miniman said. “The joke we always had is, show me the largest booth at re:Invent, and then go listen to the keynote and go see those people crying in their beer, because Amazon just announced some service that’s going to eat some of their business.” Startup bubble in trouble? \nFurrier agreed and said that Amazon’s magnet for customers may be what finally bursts the startup bubble. \n“I’m usually not a doom and gloom alarmist, but I am really nervous that the startups are going to implode,” he said, adding that Amazon and other big players like Microsoft and Oracle have huge sales forces. To compete, startups will have to ramp up their own field presence, which is difficult and expensive. Big fish, little fish \nGuest analyst during the kickoff segment, Jerry Chen , partner at Greylock Partners, said that distribution is a huge obstacle to startups . “Distribution as a startup versus incumbents is … really all you have is you have better technology,”he said, explaining that better doesn’t get you far without visibility. \nHowever, Chen sees a silver lining for startups. “I think you’re going to see a lot of innovation in the go-to-market area,” he said. \nChen believes it’s possible to “swim with the shark.” He gave the example of payment processing startup Judopay as an example, saying it is possible to piggyback on the giants. Startups need to be asking, “How do you use Amazon’s or Google’s or Azure’s or Oracle’s weight for you to kind of Judo hack?” Chen said. \nWatch the complete video interview below, and be sure to check out more of SiliconANGLE and theCUBE’s coverage of AWS re:Invent .
