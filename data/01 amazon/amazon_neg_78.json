      "title": "Seagate's portable storage device automatically syncs files to Amazon Drive",
      "text": "This week, Seagate revealed an external storage device called the Seagate Duet. It’s the result of a collaboration between Seagate and Amazon to provide a portable storage solution specifically for Amazon Drive customers. Even more, the external drive includes a free year of Amazon Drive Unlimited Storage for new Amazon Drive customers in the United States, a service that typically costs $60 per year.\nAmazon is taking pre-orders for the Seagate Duet external drive now for $100. Slated to be released on December 10, it provides 1TB of storage that automatically syncs to the Amazon Drive cloud storage service. Keep in mind that the free version of Amazon Drive only provides 5GB of online space, so users will need the yearly subscription to take full advantage of the Seagate Duet’s full syncing potential.\nMore : Seagate’s Backup Plus Portable sets a new bar, crams 5 TB into a tiny hard drive\nThere’s little to go by in regard to the actual hardware details of the new drive in Amazon’s product listing. However, it appears to be a rebranded version of Seagate’s Backup Plus Slim portable hard drive , which connects via a USB 3.0 port (USB 2.0 too), and works with both Windows PCs and Macs, the latter of which need the included NTFS driver.\nHere are the specs we managed to scrape up:\nModel number: STFX1000400 Capacity: 1TB Interface: USB 3.0 Number of hard drive platters: 2 Speed: 5,400 RPM Size: 4.47”(L) x 2.99”(W) x 0,38”(D) Weight: 0.33 pounds Transfer rate: Up to 220MB per second The drive uses perpendicular magnetic recording ( PMR ) technology to store data on its two spinning magnetic discs (platters). This type of data recording provides more storage density than the traditional “longitudinal” recording. Imagine each magnetic disc as an optical disc or a vinyl record with thousands of invisible tracks storing millions of bits on each track. The perpendicular recording method places data bits pointed up or down perpendicular to the disk surface whereas the longitudinal method places the bits “circumferentially” along the track direct.\nOnce customers connect the new Seagate Duet drive to their Windows PC or Mac, the device automatically pulls up their Amazon account. After the login process, it will then begin syncing photos, music, pictures, and other personal data the user already has stored in Amazon’s cloud. At the same time, all files saved/moved to the external drive are automatically copied to Amazon Drive as well. What’s great with this solution is that media and files placed into the Amazon Drive app for smartphones and tablets will end up on the external drive too.\n“Accessing stored files, photos, and videos while away from the Seagate Duet drive is also easy using the Amazon Drive mobile app,” Seagate said . “This phone and tablet app gives access to photos and videos saved on the Seagate Duet drive and in the cloud. This way, it’s possible to relive the best moments with loved ones wherever and whenever.”\nCustomers who pre-order the Seagate Duet drive now from Amazon will receive free shipping. Gift-wrapping is also available for those who want to throw it under the Christmas tree later this month.\nSeagate’s Backup Plus Portable sets a new bar, crams 5 TB into a tiny hard drive Seagate’s Game Drive for Xbox SSD enables faster load times for seamless gaming Seagate revealed the world’s largest tiny hard drive with 5TB in 2.5 inches",

I'm right there with you in terms of it not working forever. Railways of the World just about fits on Ikea Kallax shelves, and if you leave some space between the back of the shelves and the wall you can hide the small amount of overhang behind the shelves. Boom--problem solved! The mere thought of things falling off the back of those shelves into the gap between the unit and wall makes me shudder. I am so glad that my platoon of Ikea Billy bookcases have backs. One advantage of backless shelves is that if anything does fall behind the shelf, it's very easy to retrieve. With backed shelves that's not a concern at all though. With a collection as large as mine where there are multiple units all lined up anything falling behind could only be retrieved by removing everything from the bottom shelves to get to it. Definitely not an advantage in this case. MentatYP wrote: You would have to be a very talented klutz indeed to drop Railways of the World down the back of these shelves. Ha! I wasn't thinking of a behemoth like that, but rather the countless smaller games bits and bobs that I have on my shelves which aren't stored in receptacles. lol",

      "text": "The mass migration of data and computing power from privately owned data centers to those operated by Amazon.com, Microsoft and other competitors is one of the biggest business stories of our time. But sometimes the growth of the so-called “cloud” is hard to grasp.\nHere’s one way to look at it: Every single day, Amazon’s cloud-computing business adds enough server capacity to support the data-storage and computing needs that the online tech giant had in 2005, when it had revenue of $8.5 billion. That’s about the revenue of a middling Fortune 500 company.\nThe figure comes from James Hamilton, a high-ranking tech guru at Amazon Web Services, Amazon’s cloud-computing unit. “This is a crazy number. Think what it means,” Hamilton told an audience of cloud enthusiasts and developers Tuesday at AWS’ re:Invent conference in Las Vegas.\nIt certainly means a lot of building or leasing of warehouses, shipping servers, consuming power and such. In other words, the cloud, esoteric as it seems, relies on a very brick-and-mortar reality that needs to be continually expanded, at a cost of billions. \nMost Read Stories Snow is on way to Western Washington lowlands, weather service says FAA orders Boeing 787 safety fix: Reboot power once in a while Facebook set to double Seattle presence with another big new office Fed up with Seattle? Here's where you can go UW game day: No. 4 Huskies vs. No. 9 Colorado in Pac-12 championship Unlimited Digital Access. $1 for 4 weeks. Another way of measuring it: As of December, AWS either rented or owned about 6.7 million square feet of space, or the equivalent of some 116 football fields.\nTo the extent one can read between the lines of Amazon’s earnings statements, it can also be measured in money. From 2010 to 2015, Amazon’s technology and content spending has expanded sevenfold , to $12.5 billion. (Amazon said in its annual report that infrastructure related to AWS has been a primary driver of spending in that segment.)\nThen there’s the big truck. On Wednesday, amid thumping heavy-metal music, AWS hauled a trailerinto the cavernous meeting hall where re:Invent was being held. Its trailer carried what AWS calls a “snowmobile,” a shipping-container-sized device that can store an exabyte of data. That’s 1 billion gigabytes, equivalent to 31.25 million base iPhone 7s. \nThe point is to move the data physically from a company’s data center to Amazon’s cloud without hogging all of the world’s bandwidth.\nAll these physical trappings show the momentum the cloud has. For Amazon, it’s a business that will generate about $13 billion over a 12-month period, based on last quarter’s rate, and is obviously growing. \nThat’s why Andy Jassy, the CEO of AWS, says that over time the cloud business could top Amazon’s gigantic retail business in revenue. \n\n— Ángel González: agonzalez@seattletimes.com \n\nBusiness taxes, fees to rise in Seattle Jeff Hause, owner of the Carsmart used-car dealership on Lake City Way, was surprised when he got a postcard in the mail earlier this month saying his city business-license fee would quad­ruple next year.\nHe had been paying $110 a year for a business-license tax certificate, which expires Dec. 31 and must be renewed annually.\nHis fee for 2017, the postcard said, would be going up to $480.\n“This is a huge increase,” and one he hadn’t known was coming, said Hause. “It takes a lot of work to make $380 [the rough amount of the increase]. … I’ve got to sell another car.”\nThough some businesses may be unaware of the increase, which starts next year, it’s part of a measure proposed by Seattle Mayor Ed Murray and passed by the City Council in July to help pay for more police.\nThe Council voted unanimously to increase its business-license fees on a tiered, revenue-based system. \nFor 2017, such fees range from $55 for businesses bringing in less than $20,000 a year in revenue, to $1,000 for those making $2 million or more in sales. By 2019, large businesses with revenue of $5 million or more will pay $2,400.\nThis year and last, small businesses making sales of less than $20,000 paid $55; those making more paid $110.\nThe City Council also voted unanimously to raise the city’s business and occupation tax rates by 3.2 percent over two years. Those rates have not grown since 1991.\nTogether, those increases are expected to generate more than half the $23 million the mayor has said is needed to hire more police officers, improve the city’s 911 call center and upgrade technology for the Police Department.\nThe Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce supported the increases .\n\n— Janet I. Tu: jtu@seattletimes.com \n\nAuburn chain drops IPO plan, faces debt It may be time to give up on the hope that Auburn will have a publicly traded company specializing in adult intimacy. \nPeekay Boutiques, a chain that operates 47 locations across six states under names like Lovers and A Touch of Romance, describes itself as “a specialty retailer at the forefront of the growing mainstream acceptance” of “sexual health and wellness” products. The Auburn-based company’s filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission report the stores carry 5,000 items “ranging from $1 condoms to $265 vibrators.”\nThe Texas private-equity guy who bought Peekay and several similar chains starting in late 2012 did so with heavy leverage, figuring that the debt — topping $50 million — could be paid off when the company completed an initial public offering of stock to outside investors.\nBut now, after two years of staving off its lenders, the company acknowledges that the much-delayed IPO isn’t going to happen. \nSince mid-November it has withdrawn preliminary papers for the stock offering, ended its financial reporting to the SEC, shed some key executives and hired advisers to find a buyer or a way to restructure that massive debt.\nCompany executives did not respond to an interview request. \nAlthough it added haltingly to its store count, grew revenue slowly to $41.4 million for 2015, and showed some improvement to its bottom line, Peekay has remained in the red due to the interest on its debt. Since February, when $38.2 million in senior secured debt matured, the company hasn’t found replacement financing. \nThe latest moves include terminating its marketing chief and obtaining the resignation of its chief financial officer. \nOn Nov. 11 it hired two investment banking firms on a six-month contract to line up a sale or restructuring deal, and another firm to provide restructuring services.\nWithout a deal of some sort, a company filing says, “We may be forced to file for bankruptcy and/or liquidate our assets.”\n\n— Rami Grunbaum: rgrunbaum@seattletimes.com \n\nStarbucks mug trips on Oregon falls Starbucks could be in for a new coffee cup-related brouhaha after mislabeling a landmark on an Oregon-themed travel mug.\nThe Oregonian/OregonLive reports that the Seattle-based coffee chain has introduced a travel mug bearing sketches of notable Oregon landmarks, including Crater Lake National Park, food carts in Portland and Ashland’s Shakespeare Festival.\nBut there was also a waterfall design identified as “Klamath Falls” — and no such waterfall exists.\nThe simple line drawing of a falls topped by an arched bridge was likely meant to depict the majestic Multnomah Falls, a popular spot in the Columbia River Gorge.\nKlamath Falls, of course, is a town in southern Oregon.\nStarbucks apologized by email Thursday.\n\n— Associated Press \n\nSeattle Times staff Email Newsletter Sign-up Custom-curated news highlights, delivered weekday  ",

      "title": "President Obama's Parting Gift to Boeing: $31.2 Billion in Defense Contracts | Fox Business",
      "text": "He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick \nKuwait is a nation of just 3.4 million people. At a cost of roughly $2,700 per citizen, the purchase of 28 Eurofighter Typhoons from Airbus represents a huge investment for the country. (Note: Airbus is the largest shareholder of the Eurofighter consortium that makes the Typhoon. BAE Systems owns a 33% stake in the consortium.) And yet, it seems Kuwait has not yet run out of money to spend. \nTwo weeks ago, in a rather surprising announcement , the U.S. Defense Security Cooperation Agency notifiedCongress of Kuwait's continued interest in buying F/A-18s from Boeing (apparently in addition to the Typhoons from Airbus). As explained in DSCA's notification, Kuwait intends to purchase 32 F/A-18E fighter jets and eight more advanced F/A-18F fighters from Boeing. Total cost: $10.1 billion. \nContinue Reading Below \nNor was this the only good news Boeing shareholders got last week. Cast your eyes south \nSimultaneous with the announcement of the Kuwait fighter deal, DSCA notified Congress of a second -- even bigger -- sale of Boeing fighter jets to the Middle East. Just a few hundred miles to the south of Kuwait likes the peninsular nation of Qatar, and the Qataris seem even more infatuated with Boeing planes. \nAccording to DSCA , Qatar is seeking permission to purchase 72 F-15QA fighter jets from Boeing for the princely sum of $21.1 billion. That makes the total value of Boeing contracts being sought here $31.2 billion. What it means for Boeing -- and its investors \nIt's hard to overestimate the importance of these defense deals to Boeing, now that the Obama administration has permitted them to proceed. (Congress has literally never rejected a foreign arms deal once the DSCA has given official notification). \nFrom a sheer dollars-and-cents perspective, Boeing's military aircraft division earns 9.8% pre-tax profit margins on the planes it sells -- the second-highest profit margin of any Boeing division. Ultimately, the $31.2 billion in revenue flowing from the two deals named above should earn Boeing pre-tax profits well in excess of $3 billion, worth nearly 43% of all the profits that Boeing generated from all its businesses last year. \nBut the significance of these deals is even greater than that. \nWith demand for its fourth-generation fighter jets waning, Boeing had been planning to shut down production of its F-15s by 2019. F/A-18 production was likely to cease in 2017. Boeing Defense head Leanne Carethas been heard talking about how Boeing needed to \"evolve\" beyond fighter jets entirely, and refocus its efforts on building planes it can actually sell -- KC-46 Pegasi, C-17 Globemasters, and P-8A Poseidons. \nThanks to these last-minute sales, though, Boeing's fighter jets business has a new lease on life. \nConsider: Last year, Boeing produced and delivered 35 F/A-18 model aircraft to its customers around the world. At that build rate, the Kuwaiti deal will extend F/A-18 production by more than a year. Indeed, if Boeing can slow its production rate just a bit, the production line could operate even longer -- giving Boeing more time to find even more buyers, to extend its lifeline even further. \nMeanwhile, Boeing's F/15 was already producing at the much slower rate of just 12 planes per year. Qatar's order for 72 new F-15s extends the lifespan of that model aircraft by six more years! \nTurns out, thanks to these two last-minute contract wins, Boeing may not have to quit the defense business after all. \n10 stocks we like better than Boeing When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "(WTVM) – Online retailer Amazon hopes to bring a little joy to the world after what some would call a rough year with its new holiday advertisement.\nIn the ad, which looks to bridge the gap between religions, a priest invites an imam over for a cup of tea and meaningful conversation.\nWhen both friends go to sit down and stand up, you can see the physical struggle of age as both clench their knees and grimace in pain\nAs the imam leaves the priests’ home, both grab their phones and place an order on the Amazon app.\nDays later, both men receive a package from Amazon as they find out that each bought each other knee braces.\nBoth men put on their gift and can kneel for prayer pain-free.\nClick here to watch the advertisement from Amazon , which has gotten over 1 million views on YouTube.\nCopyright 2016 WTVM .

      "text": "Amazon is continuing its push into online streaming video by letting its Prime customers purchase monthly subscriptions to HBO and Cinemax right from their Amazon accounts.\nHBO will be available on Prime for $15 a month, while the Cinemax add-on will cost $10 a month, Amazon said in a release.\nBoth channels were also recently announced as add-ons to AT&T's new streaming service, DirecTV Now, highlighting HBO and Cinemax's attempts to reach beyond their traditional audience of cable subscribers. As many as 20 million U.S. households lack cable TV, AT&T estimates, either because they canceled their plans or because they never had one to begin with.\nWhile it may seem odd for Amazon to offer yet another way to get HBO when consumers can already get it directly through HBO's own streaming app, HBO Now, for exactly the same price, being able to consolidate your bills a little could be useful. For Amazon, the premium channel serves as another incentive for Americans to sign onto Prime, the company's lucrative membership service. (Amazon founder Jeffrey P. Bezos also owns The Washington Post.)\nAnd because Amazon's HBO viewers will be watching \"Westworld,\" \"Game of Thrones\" and other hit shows through Amazon Channels, the online retailer's video portal, Amazon could get credit for all that streaming when analysts compare it to the likes of Netflix and Hulu. Numbers from Sandvine show Amazon Video accounts for 4.26 percent of all internet traffic consumed in North America during peak hours, versus 35 percent for Netflix.\nIf more people start streaming \"Silicon Valley\" and \"The Night Of\" through Amazon, those numbers could rise. And that would be good for Amazon.\n Business Technology Television Washington Post",

      "text": "Amazon.com is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world's largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple.\nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant, according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced.\nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said.\nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon's new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon, based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment.\nSo-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon's hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014. Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating U.S. sales of more than 5 million units since 2014.\nAmazon's planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.'s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant.\nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box. The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker's screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said.\nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said.\nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon's Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as \"Knight.\"\n Technology Bloomberg",

      "text": "_ \nThis post originally appeared on Backchannel.\nIn the Game of Thrones -like artificial intelligence competition between Houses Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft, the company most reticent to speak about its technology has usually been the one that ships planeloads full of stuff to consumers, hosts thousands of companies in its data centers, greenlit Catastrophe , and has a breakaway hit product that answers questions, plays music, and 4,998 or so other things.\nYes, for some time, Amazon has been even more shrouded than the famously secret Apple, which opened up about its machine learning programs earlier this year.\nLately, however, Amazon’s head scientist and vice president of Alexa, Rohit Prasad, has been speaking up in public, making the case for his company’s prowess in voice recognition and natural language understanding.\nAlexa, of course, is the conversational platform that supports that aforementioned hit product, Echo .\nOn Wednesday Prasad gave an Alexa “State of the Union” address at the Amazon Web Services conference in Las Vegas, announcing an improved version of the Alexa Skills Kit , which helps developers create the equivalent of apps for the platform; a beefed-up Alexa Voice Service , which will make it easier to transform third-party devices like refrigerators and cars into Alexa bots; a partnership with Intel; and the Alexa Accelerator that, with the startup incubator Techstars , will run a 13-week program to help newcomers build Alexa skills.\nPrasad and Amazon haven’t revealed sales numbers, but industry experts have estimated that Amazon has sold over five million Echo devices so far.\nPrasad, who joined Amazon in 2013, spent some time with Backchannel before his talk to illuminate the direction of Alexa and discuss how he’s recruiting for Jeff Bezos’s arsenal without drying up the AI pipeline. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.\nSteven Levy: You’re a VP of Alexa. Tell me where things stand with it in 2016. \nRohit Prasad: We’re excited about where things are. We did several device launches and also expanded internationally. And we’ve made huge progress in teaching Alexa to better understand you, both in terms of the surface area Alexa covers, as well as accuracy within search material. For instance, think about music as a domain: We have new capabilities [for] you [to be] able to search for or play a song, based on its lyrics. And lastly is the speed at which third-party skills are being built. Earlier this year we had only a few hundred, and now we are in the 5,000 range.\n_ \nWhat are the conversational aspirations for the Alexa platform? Are our Echos something we should be talking to, or talking with? \nAlexa is already providing a large set of utilities and experiences, where a few one-shot intents work with very high accuracy. From a conversational aspect, I think there a lot of trade-offs on doing it right. Alexa shouldn’t come back and ask you [needless] questions. That would be really frustrating. But Alexa should always ask a question when needed, and the ability to have a conversation is super important as well. Are you aware of the Alexa Prize competition?\nThis is the $2.5 million challenge to computer science students that you announced in September? \nYes. In academia it’s hard to do research in conversation areas because they don’t have a system like Alexa to work with. So we are making it easy to build new conversational capabilities with a modified version of the Alexa skills kit. This grand challenge is to create a social bot that can carry on a meaningful, coherent, and engaging conversation for 20 minutes. \nWould that be a Turing-level kind of conversation, do you think? \nNo, the Turing test comes down to human gullibility — can you fool an outsider into thinking it’s a human? If you think about certain tasks, Alexa is already better than a human. It’s super hard for a human to play a particular song out of millions of catalog entries within a second, right? If you ask Alexa to compute factorial of 60, that’s hard for a human. So we definitely did not want it to be like a Turing test. It’s more about coherence and engagement.\nWhat are people going to be talking about in these 20 minute conversations with Alexa? \nWe are giving topics. Like, “Can you talk on the trending topics in today’s newspaper?” We expect the social bot to be able to chat with you on topics like scientific inventions, or the financial crisis.\nHave you had a lot of responses to the challenge? \nWe got an overwhelming number of applications, hundreds and hundreds. We are providing funding to university students — these are grad students who are also taking time off from their research, or hopefully it’s very aligned with their research, so we wanted to make sure that they have sponsorship for the compelling application of speech. We got so many that we couldn’t decide on the original ten we had planned, and we ended up funding twelve teams .\nBecause of the huge demand in corporations for the best students in AI and machine learning, there’s worry that academia might lose its core talent. \nIt is a concern. This is one of the reasons that I was motivated to start the Alexa Prize. We want to build the next generation of machine learning and AI scientists, and academia plays an important role in that. I think it would be very myopic and very scary if every professor moved to companies like us.\nOn the other hand, you are obviously hiring AI talent, competing with with Google, Facebook, Microsoft, Apple, and even traditional companies. What’s the pitch that you give potential recruits to come to Amazon? \nI don’t think I should answer that, because those other companies will copy it.\nActually, if you answer it well, those people might read it here and apply to work at Amazon .\nWhat’s unique about research in a company like Amazon is the combination of data, computing power, and the best minds in the world all coming together to solve a customer-facing problem. Working on a customer-facing problem doesn’t take away the innovation — it actually accelerates  innovation. The problems we try to solve at Amazon are all super, super hard. When Alexa started, solving speech recognition and natural language understanding across many different domains was clearly a very, very hard problem.\nYou are announcing new tools that will help developers, right? \nYes. One of the key things we want to make simple for developers is what we call “built-in intent” and “slot types.”\nExplain, please. \nIn most skills, people will want to say things like, “Alexa, stop.” Or “cancel.” You want those commands, or intents, to be exposed to the developer, rather than trying to tell developers to build customized versions of things like the cancel/stop intent. Slot types are things like city names, vocabulary items. We had previously done a handful of them, things developers use quite often — around 10 intents and 15 slot types. So as part of third-party skills we’re announcing a larger set of hundreds built-in functions — slot types — across different domains, like books, video, or local businesses. And also a large set of intents as well, which help answer queries that people ask Alexa.\nSo in other words, if I’m the developer, I can rely on your built-in vocabulary and your interpretation of synonyms, in order to make my skill smarter off the bat. And you’re doing more. \nExactly. It gives you a much better starting point for interaction with skills. We’re announcing this as a developer preview, because of two reasons. One is, we want to see how people use these in their intents, because we have a certain mindset of how these intents and types should be used. But the developer may have a slightly different mindset. And the customer may use it slightly differently as well. We want to make sure that we get some feedback from the developers and continually improve these, and we will keep adding more and more built-ins.\nRight now, when users invoke a skill on Echo, the mind of Alexa, to some degree, gets turned over to that developer. So what you’re implementing today is a step toward a standard Alexa vocabulary and means of execution that developers will plug into? \nYou’re absolutely right, this creates a common vocabulary which works for sharing and for helping Alexa itself to become better and better. Developers can integrate this new functionality so that they don’t have to recreate the same things.\nMy issue with Alexa is I’m just overwhelmed by what is available. Generally, you have to know that a skill exists in order to invoke it. Now that you are at 5,000 skills and counting, how can a user keep up? \nWe definitely want Alexa to tell you how to accomplish your query through a third-party skill, even if you don’t have knowledge of the skill. We haven’t done it yet, but definitely that’s something on our roadmap. Having a common vocabulary helps get us to that connection.\nAmazon is only one of several companies using AI to build a conversational interface. What’s unique about your approach? \nThe hands-free ability is key. That’s the killer application for speech. If you think about Alexa and Echo in particular, there was no cop-out in terms of solving the hard problem of interaction without a screen. So our thinking, from the get-go, was very different from other companies in terms of how conversation interface should be. It wasn’t like on a phone; it was a completely dedicated device which didn’t have a screen. We had to solve the hard problem.\nWhat about people who are concerned about having an open mic in the home? What can you tell people who are worried about, “Oh my god, Amazon is listening to me all the time!” \nPrivacy is important, and we are being very, very transparent about how we are approaching this. The cloud is not listening to you. It’s only on the device, acting as a detector, not a recognizer recognizing all words. It’s detecting whether Alexa is spoken versus something else. Once it determines Alexa was spoken to the device at a very high confidence, only then do we start streaming to the cloud.\nWill Alexa become proactive like Google Now or Apple notifications? Maybe telling me, if it hears me knocking around the house, that I should leave because I’m late for an appointment? \nWe’ve definitely thought about it. Because there’s no screen on Echo, there are some new [challenges] to it. We want to do things right with anything in terms of the kind of notifications you’re talking about. But right now I can’t reveal our exact approach to that.\nRight now, people pretty much have to choose one conversational interface for their assistant. Will we ever see some mashup where Alexa, Cortana, Google Home, or Samsung Viv, or whatever, all work together? \nIt’s very early days in these conversational settings. Having seen this for 20-plus years I still feel that the [intellectual property] of Alexa and Echo are revolutionary material, specifically in terms of interface. I think it remains to be seen; every company has a different set of offerings so you can imagine that there would be multiple AIs. But in terms of interoperation, it’s too early to tell.\nEcho, and the Alexa technology, seemed to come as a surprise to a lot of us, and at first people thought it was intended as a quick way to buy products from Amazon. Now it’s one of Amazon’s most popular products and a significant platform. Has your mission shifted? \nI wouldn’t say the mission has shifted. We are still very much doing things that we said three years back we should be doing. Right now there’s just a lot to do to make Alexa even more magical for our customers.\n \nMore from Backchannel: Do Startups Have a Drinking Problem? \nWhat I Saw Inside Apple’s Top Secret Input Lab \nProof The Internet Really Has Changed Everything \nInstagram is Ruining Vacation \n",

      "text": "\nThumb Score: +1 Looking for a brown switch mechanical keyboard with software programmable RGB backlights, this Patriot Viper V760 deal at Amazon is the least expensive I have found. \n\nhttps://www.amazon.com/gp/product...UTF8&psc=1 \n\nSold by Highly Anticipated Electronics and Fulfilled by Amazon. Prime eligible. No tax in my state. No negative seller ratings in the past year.\n\nAs far as I can tell this is the lowest price ever. The same keyboard sold by Amazon itself is $93.50 plus (in MI at least) tax. Currently $111.59 on Newegg and $119.99 direct from the manufacturer.\n",

      "text": "Amazon locking out holiday grinches Posted: Amazon has released a new service that will stop a Grinch in his tracks. (WFSB) WEST HARTFORD, CT (WFSB) - \nAmazon has released a new service that will stop a Grinch in his tracks. \nIts bright yellow exterior makes the Amazon Locker hard to miss. \nThe new device provides users with a self-service delivery location to pick up and return their packages. \nAmazon customers are looking forward to using the product. \n\"I'd use it and I'd also pass the word along for other people to know it is available,\" Jill Thayer, of Bristol said. \nCreators of the device hope it will prove useful in preventing package theft around the holidays. \nRecently, a man was caught stealing packages from a front porch on Culver Street in Newington. \nIn Vernon, another man was caught doing the exact same thing. \n\"It would be great because you wouldn't have to worry about it,\" Vernon resident Mike Lynch said. \nOnce customers receive notification their package has arrived at the closest Amazon Locker, they'll leave a pick up code. \nUsers can then follow the instructions on the screen of the locker, which will open the door to the package. \nAlthough there's a catch. If it isn't picked up within three days, it gets sent back. \nFor now, availability could also be inconvenient because there are currently just a few of the lockers in the state. \nCopyright 2016 WFSB (Meredith Corporation).

      "text": "Close Amazon Dash Buttons Launched In The U.K. This article originally appeared on the Motley Fool.\nAmazon has continually tried to make ordering easier, especially when it comes to household items that people generally replace after using.\nThe company lets people order via its Echo voice assistant, and it has hundreds of companies in its Dash replenishment program. The first iteration of that effort has been single-brand buttons that people put in the locations where they use the item. One push, and the item is reordered through Amazon. For example, a person may have a Tide Dash button near his or her washing machine and one tied to a favorite cereal in the pantry.\nHowever, Dash is not solely linked to devices programmed by Amazon. The company has a number of APIs (essentially a piece of software allowing third parties access to the technology) that will bring Dash to a whole new range of products. At the core of all of them is the idea that it will make ordering from Amazon easier—or even automated.\nNow, a number of new companies have joined Amazon's automated replenishment program. One of those new partners makes a device to attach to your trash can that, with your help, looks at what you throw away in order to reorder those items for you.\nAn Amazon.com Inc driver stands next to an Amazon delivery truck in Los Angeles, California, U.S., May 21, 2016. Lucy Nicholson/Reuters What is a smart trash can? GeniCan , which starts at $124.99, is an add-on sensor for trash cans. The device, which ships in January, is programmable. People simply scan the bar code of any product they want added to their replenishment list. As the smart-trash-can owner throws an item away, he or she simply needs to run the bar code past the in-can scanner to have it reordered. Or, if there is no bar code, you can add an item to your list by speaking to the machine. If you merely throw the item in the trash, it won't be added to the shopping list.\nOwners of GeniCan tie the device to a shopping list app in their smartphone. They can either use the list to shop for needed items themselves or place their order on Amazon for delivery. Unlike Dash buttons, which place an order when pressed (but only one until it has been delivered), the smart trash can requires that the owner choose to actually place the order.\n\"Dash Replenishment saves our customers even more time by automatically ordering items,\" said company co-founder Rob Griffin in an Amazon press release. \"Now they can reorder items directly from their garbage can and recycle bin at the perfect time: the moment the item is being disposed of.\"\nIt's not just about garbage cans While the smart garbage can is a clever use of Dash replenishment technology, it's not the only expansion for the service. Amazon also introduced a number of others this week:\nHoneywell-connected devices will \"calculate when a new air filter is needed and automatically reorder from Amazon.\" Nestle's BabyNes system is \"Wi-Fi-enabled and syncs with a smartphone to allow parents to track a baby's nutrition or get an alert when a caregiver feeds the baby.\" The app allows parents to buy formula capsules based on tracked consumption. WePlenish offers services using Dash that track a consumer's coffee consumption in order to reorder when supplies run low and a similar tracker for pet food. Only some of these ideas will catch on. It's very likely that many, if not most of these products, will fail. The core idea, however, is solid: make it easy for people to get the items they use the most.\n10 stocks we like better than Amazon.com When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for over a decade, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has tripled the market. David and Tom just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now… and Amazon.com wasn't one of them! Click here to learn about these picks!\n ",

      "text": "\nThe Treasure Truck is going Beast Mode.\nAmazon’s deals-on-wheels truck has a cool offering for customers today with an extra special guest: former Seahawks running back Marshawn Lynch.\nLynch, who spent six seasons in Seattle and helped the team win a Super Bowl in 2013, will be driving the Treasure Truck just before noon Saturday just outside of CenturyLink Field.\nHe’ll also spend 90 minutes signing autographs and handing out today’s deal: a Marshawn Lynch Beast Mode-skinned Amazon Echo (the company’s popular voice-activated speaker ) and Beast Mode Hat and for $139.99.\nToday’s promotion comes just a few days after Amazon released a new Alexa Skill that Echo owners can try out. It’s called “Marshawn Lynch’s BeastMode” and lets you speak commands like “Alexa, Ask BeastMode how was the game?” or “Alexa, Ask BeastMode what’s your favorite candy.” Alexa responds with Lynch’s voice — it’s pretty funny.\nThis is not the first time Amazon has partnered with Lynch. The retired NFL player unveiled a new portal in April to sell his Beast Mode brand apparel online, opening up a storefront on Amazon.com as part of the company’s “ Exclusives ” line.\n \n \n \n \nGeekWire will be reporting from CenturyLink Field today, so check back later for photos and videos of Marshawn’s visit.",

(Or, we were, until Dominion + Intrigue: Second Edition came out, but I’ll probably just try to get those done as one thing later. Actually, that reminds me, Intrigue won’t be standalone moving forward — I should update that post.) Anyways, there’s only Adventures, Empires, and Alchemy after this (and the Second Editions), which isn’t all that much. Should be exciting!Anyways, in Dominion: Guilds, the world is starting to change. All these guilds are popping up offering people jobs and hope (which, to be fair, after Dark Ages and all those rats, shelters, and ruins, seems like a pretty good deal). Naturally, you want to get in on that action and the new sources of income these guilds can provide. Can you leverage their expertise to build a grand dominion?",

      "text": "hulu launches k streaming spectre snow scene More Both Netflix and Amazon have been offering select content in 4K Ultra HD for quite some time now and comparatively, Hulu has been slow to follow. Now the streaming service has finally jumped on the 4K bandwagon , as The Verge reports, but there isn’t a wealth of content at launch, and ways to watch are limited.\nAs usual, you’ll need to make sure that you have a 4K-ready TV and fast enough internet to support a 4K stream — Hulu says it requires a minimum of 13 megabits per second for 4K streaming — but you’ll also need supported hardware. Right now, only two devices are capable of streaming 4K from Hulu: the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S game consoles.\nMore : Hulu’s two new deals bring its internet TV service close than ever\nIf you’re fortunate enough to have the right hardware to watch Hulu’s new 4K streams, you’ll also find content is limited. The bulk of available content right now consists of Hulu original series like 11.22.63 , The Path, Chance, and Shut Eye. If you’re a fan of Hulu’s original programming, this is great, but otherwise the offerings seem somewhat lackluster. Unless, that is, you’re a James Bond fan.\nIn addition to Hulu originals, a total of 20 Bond films from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer catalog are available in 4K. This includes the recent Spectre, and classics like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Dr. No , among others.\nThough there isn’t much here at the start, it’s telling that Hulu has finally entered the 4K game at all. It’s a fairly safe bet that more content will be available sooner rather than later, and it shouldn’t be too long before the service offers 4K content on other devices as well. Whether HDR (high dynamic range) content is on the way as well is currently unknown, but with both Netflix and Amazon supporting it, it seems likely that Hulu would like to offer it eventually.\nGot a new 4K UHD TV? Here’s where to go to start watching the best 4K content right now What sort of hardware does your PC need to play games at 4K resolution?",

      "text": "Stuart Leave a Comment \nOver at Amazon, their usual Lighting Deal Shop Vac wet/dry vacuum special has been on sale at special pricing – $89. \nI bought this vacuum last year, and it’s a very nice model with one exception – the top “handle” is attached to the blower, and so if you pull it up the motor disassembles for blower use. So I’ve got to carry it from the side handles. Advertisement \nOther than that, it’s a great vacuum bundled with a great selection of accessories, and at a great price. I can’t tell you about how well the included filters work, I immediately equipped mine with a Cleanstream filter . \nThis doesn’t look to be a deal of the day, but there’s no clear indication as to how long the price will hold at this sale price. 12 gallon capacity 6.5 Peak HP rating (these numbers are usually meaningless except for comparison without a brand) Ultra Pro series 2-1/2″ hose and accessory size 8′ hose with lock-on mount 18′ power cord 14″ floor nozzle, 8″ utility nozzle Crevice tool, concentrator nozzle, blower nozzle Elbow grip, 120° elbow Cartridge filter and disposable filter bag \nPrice: $89 \nThe blower can be used for clearing walkways or blowing out gutters, but I haven’t used it much yet. The vacuum part works very well, though. Share:",

      "text": "by Rob Williams — Saturday, December 03, 2016 Amazon AWS Snowmobile Transfers Exabyte-Scale Data Using 18-Wheelers \nDo you need to move a lot of data? To be clear: we're talking lots of data. Sure, that 64 TB NAS box might seem meaty, but that's paltry compared to the kind of data we're talking about. Think 100,000 TB, aka 100 PB. \nIt's almost hard to wrap our heads around that kind of storage , but that's the amount Amazon says it can move with ease via its new Snowmobile service. In essence, Snowmobile comes to us in the form of a pure-white 18-wheeler that's used to bring your data from point A to point B. \nAmazon says that Snowmobile will show up at your door after a quick assessment and then work with you to connect the truck's internal storage to yours, and then begin milking it until everything is transferred. This will be done over super-fast network pipes, but considering the amount of storage that could be moved here, it goes without saying that the transfer process is not going to be quick - think \"weeks\" if you come anywhere near 100 PB. \nOnce the data is loaded in a Snowmobile, Amazon drives off with it to a datacenter where the data will be transferred yet again to either Amazon's S3 or Glacier services. \nClearly, moving this amount of data isn't for the feint of heart, and there's always going to be that nagging doubt that something could go wrong. To make sure that nothing goes wrong, Amazon protects the data with GPS tracking, alarm monitoring, 24/7 video surveillance, dedicated security personnel, and even offers the option to include an escort security vehicle in the mix. \nNot surprisingly, pricing can only be found out about if you reach out to Amazon with an inquiry. That's probably for the best, as we can better protect our jaws by not knowing.",
