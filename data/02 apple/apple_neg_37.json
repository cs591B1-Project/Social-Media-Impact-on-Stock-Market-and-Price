      "text": "Apple's Black Friday Event Kicks Off in United States With Free Gift Cards Worth Up to $150 Friday November 25, 2016 12:02 am PST by Joe Rossignol Apple's special Black Friday shopping event is now live in the United States and Canada , offering customers free Apple Store gift cards worth up to $150 or CA$200 with the purchase of selected Apple products today only. The offers are available through Apple's website and retail stores in both countries. Each customer is limited to two gift cards per product category. Refurbished products and educational store purchases do not qualify. The one-day promotion is also ongoing in the United Kingdom (up to £120) and elsewhere in Europe, including Austria , Belgium , Czech Republic , Denmark , Finland , France , Germany , Hungary , Ireland , Italy , Luxembourg , the Netherlands , Norway , Poland , Portugal , Spain , Sweden , and Switzerland . The event runs for a little longer in Australia and New Zealand , where Apple is offering gift cards worth up to AU$200 or NZ$215. Apple's offers are rather lackluster considering better Black Friday deals are available on select iPhones, iPads, and Macs from authorized resellers such as B&H Photo Video and MacMall . Moreover, many of Apple's newest products such as the iPhone 7 and MacBook Pro with Touch Bar are not eligible for the gift card promotion.",

Cellebrite is at this point the company behind the most advanced software for hacking smartphones out there, no matter the brand, the model, or the security system used to block access to the data, and in a demonstration for AFP, the firm demonstrated how easy it is to break into a phone. The security researchers at Cellebrite hacked an LG G4 running the latest version of Android in only a few seconds, managing to access the latest photos, as well location and time for each file.

      "text": "Here’s a sneak peek at Apple’s official Black Friday 2016 deals Chris Smith Pin it Share Black Friday is almost here, and Apple this year will offer buyers in various markets some incentives to get a new iPhone, iPad, or Mac this Friday. While Apple’s Black Friday 2016 deals aren’t listed on its US website just yet, Apple fans in Australia and New Zealand — where it’s almost Friday — have already received their Black Friday news from Apple. These deals are likely a preview of things to come in Canada, UK, and US in a few hours… and we have mixed feelings about them. DEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now! This is Apple, so don’t expect crazy savings on its latest products. In fact, the iPhone 7, MacBook Pro (late 2016), and Apple Watch Series 2 aren’t even included in the sale. If that’s what you’re looking for, your interests would be better served elsewhere, as plenty of retailers are hosting much better sales on Apple gear already. Here’s what Apple will offer its customers in Australia and New Zealand on Black Friday: Australia Up to A$70 Apple Gift Card when you order iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s and pay in full Up to A$140 Apple Gift Card when you buy selected iPad models (iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4) A$35 Apple Gift Card for Apple Watch Series 1 purchase A$200 Apple Gift Card for select Mac computers (offer does not include 2016 MacBook Pro models) A$35 Apple Gift Card for Apple TV purchase New Zealand Up to NZ$75 Apple Gift Card when you order iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, or iPhone 6s and pay in full Up to NZ$145 Apple Gift Card when you buy selected iPad models (iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, iPad mini 4) NZ$35 Apple Gift Card for Apple Watch Series 1 purchase NZ$215 Apple Gift Card for select Mac computers (offer does not include 2016 MacBook Pro models) NZ$35 Apple Gift Card for Apple TV purchase Apple will probably offer Black Friday sales along the same lines to its American, Canadian, and British customers come November 25th.

The camera which uses LG InnotekĄŻs dual camera will likely to be applied for AppleĄŻs new products starting from the latter half of next year. Sources close to the situation said, Ą°Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG InnotekĄŻs smartphone camera,Ąą adding, Ą°Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year.Ąą Apple acquired an Israeli start-up LinX in April 2015 for US$20 million, absorbing the latterĄŻs 3D camera technology. LinX, founded in 2011, has the technology of adding more depth to photos by dividing the digital image in three stages. To realize 3D photographing, it is needed to be complemented by dual camera technology. LG Innotek is now exclusively supplying its dual cameras for AppleĄŻs iPhone 7 which was released in Korea last month. LG Innotek has its own 3D camera technology applied for Optimus 3D, released in 2011 by LG Electronics. autonomy@hankyung.com Article in Korean 2016-11-22 18:04:43 LGŔĚłëĹŘŔĚ žÖÇĂ°ú ÇÔ˛˛ 3Â÷żř(3D) ĂÔżľŔĚ °Ą´ÉÇŃ ˝ş¸śĆŽĆůżë ÄŤ¸Ţśó ¸đľâŔť °łšßÇĎ°í ŔÖ´Ů.

      "text": "Huawei now most profitable Android brand Huawei G9 Plus While Apple continues to dominate the market with a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide, Huawei grabs the second place but ranks as the most effective Android brand as well. by Codrut Nistor, 2016/11/25 Android Smartphone Business Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here When talking about smartphones, Apple has been the leading brand for a while, and it seems they are not going to lose the crown anytime soon. On the other hand, Samsung has been severely hit by the Note 7 failure and Huawei is the company that took advantage of the situation and climbed on the second place worldwide. Even more, the Chinese brand is now the most profitable one in the Android sector of the market. According to Strategy Analytics' director, Linda Sui, \"Apple dominated and captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide. Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple.\" She also revealed that the global smartphone market realized total operating profits of $9.4 billion during Q3 2016. Unfortunately, the cold numbers show Apple's total domination - while the iPhone maker had a profit of $8.5 billion in the third quarter, Huawei barely managed to exceed $0.2 billion (2.4 percent market share). Vivo, OPPO, and the other brands grabbed 2.2 percent each. See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

This is a profit-hungry company that didn’t even hold a Black Friday sale last year, so we should probably be thankful they’re now offering these modest complimentary gift cards with select iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac and Apple TV purchases.\nNamely, up to $50 coupons are to be had stateside if you’re in the market for a SIM-free iPhone SE, 6s or 6s Plus today only, up to $100 gifts on all available iPad models, including Pros, the Air 2 and Mini 4, a flat $25 freebie for the Apple Watch Series 1 family, $150 with “select” Macs (no Touch Bar variant ), and $25 when you buy an Apple TV.\nExtremely similar one-day deals are on across a number of other territories, like Canada or Australia, and it goes without saying you can save a lot more through third-party retailers or carriers . For instance, T-Mobile and Verizon on American shores. Not to mention the avalanche of direct iPad markdowns at Best Buy , Walmart , Target and so on. Still, if you absolutely have to do your shopping at Apple, up to $150 gift cards are better than nothing, we guess.\nThe post Apple’s Black Friday ‘shopping event’ is all about gift cards for old gear appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "iPhone 8 Could Feature a 3D Camera Built by LG GO Report claims Apple and LG signed deals on 3D cameras Nov 25, 2016 05:59 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: The next-year iPhone, which could be called iPhone 8, is expected to represent a major overhaul in terms of design and features, with sources familiar with the matter suggesting that a glass body with metal frame and OLED screen are all likely to be adopted. And now, there’s a new report coming from Korea which provides us with a new hint regarding a possible feature coming on the iPhone 8. The Korea Economic Daily writes that Apple and LG signed a partnership focused on the production of 3D camera modules for a future iPhone model. Details are very scarce at the moment, but the source notes that the 3D camera tech is supposed to be used on Apple products “from the latter half of next year,” which is most likely a sign that the iPhone 8 could be the very first model to get it – the next iPhone is projected to launch in the fall as per Apple’s typical release schedule. If we’re trying to connect the dots, it all makes sense for Apple. First and foremost, this is without a doubt a hardware partnership, so Apple needs to supply the software for a 3D camera to work on iPhones. Hardware and software Cupertino already has the software for such a project, as the firm previously purchased Israeli imaging company LinX last year, taking control of its enhanced camera system that also includes 3D depth mapping. This technology is already being used on the existing iPhones, including for the Portrait Mode available on the iPhone 7 Plus, but Apple clearly sees the potential of exploring the 3D world. At the same time, Apple already owns several patents that hinted of a 3D future for the iPhone, so even if the next-year model doesn’t get such a camera, there’s a good chance that a future iPhone will have it. Is this in any way related to Apple’s efforts of integrating augmented reality support in the iPhone? It could be, especially because Tim Cook himself admitted that this is one of the features that they’re looking for right now and which could make way on their products in the coming years. At first glance, the iPhone 8 is indeed going to be major revamp of the iPhone lineup, and it really makes sense. It’ll celebrate the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, and Apple has every reason in the world to make it a hit.",

      "text": "Apple’s 10.5 Inch iPad Pro To Launch In March 8:39 am By Roland Hutchinson \nWe previously heard a rumor about a new 10.5 inch iPad Pro that Apple will be launching next year and according to a recent report, this new iPad will be made official in March. \nThe news comes in a report from Digitimes who have said that Apple will start production of their new iPad Pro next month. \nApple is launching the 10.5-inch iPad mainly because 10-inch and larger tablets have been popular among enterprises and the education sector in the US, the sources said.Its existing 9.7-inch iPad may be too small and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro too expensive for such procurement, the sources indicated. \nThe 10.5-inch iPad will be equipped with Apple-developed CPU A10X which is also used in 12.9-inch iPad Pro, the sources noted. \nAs soon as we get some more details on the new iPad Pro including some specifications and a launch date for the device, we will let you guys know.",

      "text": "iPhone 8 May Sport LG-Made Dual Cameras for 3D Photography Apple working with LG Innotek to include 3D-enabled dual cameras Apple utilising Israeli camera technology start-up company LinX for 3D In 2017, only the iPhone 8 Plus expected to sport 3D cameras \nApple is rumoured to be working with an LG subsidiary to bring 3D photography to iPhone 8. The Korean Economic Daily, citing people familiar with matter, reports that the Cupertino-based giant is working with LG Innotek to add a dual-camera setup to the next iPhone to capture 3D imagery. \nThe sources claim that Apple is now \"studying how to apply its 3D camera technology\" into LG Innotek's smartphone camera. \"Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within [the] next year,\" the report cites a source close to the situation. \nIn its attempt to add 3D technology, the company is utilising the Israeli camera technology startup company LinX, which was acquired by Apple in April 2015. To recall, LinX expertise in allowing apps to freely use the 3D information captured by camera on the device to achieve new features such as the ability to refocus an image after it has been captured, measurement of the true dimensions of objects, 3D object modelling and real time background replacement for video calls. The report adds that LG Innotek is already \"exclusively supplying\" its dual cameras for iPhone 7 Plus . The report adds that LG Innotek also has experience dealing with 3D cameras as LG launched its first 3D-enabled smartphone, LG Optimus 3D in 2011.\nConsidering that the all-new dual camera was seen only on the large iPhone 7 Plus, we can expect the 3D tech feature on the iPhone 8 Plus model likely to launch next year. Based on preliminary leaks, Apple is said to ditch the 'iPhone 7s' name for next year's iPhone based on its naming convention and directly name it iPhone 8 considering 2017 will be its tenth anniversary of launch of the original iPhone . An earlier report suggested that Apple is also making efforts to include AR features in an upcoming iPhone camera app.",

Apple Watch: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy any Apple Watch Series 1 model ($269-$299). Apple TV: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an Apple TV ($149). Apple also wants you to shop the event online — it is offering free delivery on products ordered today, as previously announced, and it has said the best way to shop the event is via the Apple Store app.\nIt looks like Apple is also offering Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, free for three months.\nNOW WATCH: A mysterious cloud moving 700,000 mph is going to collide with our galaxy — here's what will happen \n",

      "text": "\nAccess the Touch Bar from your Mac desktop By Nick Peers | 23 Nov 16 \nApple’s Touch Bar is a major new selling point for its latest generation of MacBooks, but that doesn’t mean you have to purchase one to find out what it’s all about. Apple provided a virtual simulator for developers to use in order to get a sense for how it works and how to test their own apps with it, but what about the rest of us? The simulator requires Xcode, is fiddly to implement and difficult to screenshot. \nEnter, stage left, ex-Apple software engineer Daniel Jalkut. He’s developed Touché as a solution to all three problems described above, so it’s as relevant for developers as it is for home users who’d like to try out the Touch Bar on their existing Mac. \nDownload the zip, then drag the app file into your Applications folder, then launch it. If you get a message about your Mac not being fully up to date, click 'More info' and follow the prompts to obtain the latest version of macOS 10.12.1. Once installed and rebooted, the app should launch with no further issues. \nYou’ll see it appear at the bottom of your screen, immediately above the Dock (if it’s visible). You can click and drag it anywhere on-screen, then use the key combos (select Touché > Preferences to set your own) to hide/show the bar on demand, plus save screenshots on demand. It’s an exact copy of the actual Touch Bar, sporting the same controls, which are context-sensitive depending on whether supportive apps like Safari are running. And if you’re connected to a touchscreen, you can even interface with it on-screen using your fingers. \nThis is a brilliant, user-friendly implementation of Apple’s new Touch Bar, minus the price tag. If you’re planning on upgrading purely for the new Touch Bar feature, use this to familiarise yourself before you take the plunge – you might even decide it’s a perfectly sensible alternative. Verdict \nA superb implementation of Apple’s latest eye-catching technology – without the hefty price tag. Specification: Touché 1.0.1: ",

      "title": "Apple’s iPhone 8 Might Not Be Designed by Jony Ive",
      "text": "Jony Ive was the man to blame for every little design annoyance on the latest iPhone models, but starting with the next year version, you might have to look for someone else to criticize if something doesn’t work exactly as you expected. Ive is reportedly less involved in the iPhone design process these days, as he’s more focused on other projects at the Cupertino company, including the new spaceship campus. Apple watcher and writer Jason Snell revealed during John Gruber’s “The Talk Show” podcast that Jony Ive is no longer directly involved in product design, as the focus is now architecture. “I’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,” Snell said. “Meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with I...",

      "text": "- New 5 inch (12.7 centimetre) and 5.8 inch (14.7 centimetre) models - A new 'pure white' model Reports last week also suggest that Apple could be introducing augmented reality to its iPhone 8. Using augmented reality (AR), Apple would use the iPhone's advanced sensors to generate real-time views of the user's surroundings while superimposing digital information. Augmented reality in Apple's camera could enrich a live view of a city street with a map for directions, facts about nearby buildings, or add an animated video game character to the scene. Until now, little has been known about Apple's next iPhone, although reports by a source speaking to Nikkei Asian Review have said that it will have a curved screen. If those rumours are true, the iPhone 8 could rival the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge which came out in February this year. In January, Apple revisited a patent filed in 2013, which proposed a curved 'glass' case made from an intricate fusion of metals melted together. The design - made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together - is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber. Rumours suggest that the iPhone 8 could be made from Bulk Amorphous Alloy, which is a mix of titanium, nickel, copper and zirconium melted together. This is said to have the smooth texture of glass and the rigid sturdiness of rubber (artist's impression) Despite widespread excitement over the unique design, it still hasn't reached the general public. Other rumours suggest that the iPhone 8 could have a folding element, after Apple was granted two patents for folding technology this month. The patents have led to rumours that the Cupertino brand's upcoming iPhone 8 could be influenced by 1990s flip phones, made popular by Motorola. Other rumours suggest that the iPhone 8 could have a folding element, after Apple was granted two patents for folding technology this month The new patent illustration shows a hinge in the middle of the handset's display that would enable it to bend in half. Apple usually releases a new model, and then an 'S' version of that model the next year, so many were expecting an iPhone 7S to be released in 2017. But with the tenth anniversary looming, some believe that Apple will bypass the 7S and go straight to the iPhone 8. Apple is yet to reply to comment on any of the rumours.

      "text": "Apple \n\nApple's pre-announced Black Friday event is here, and it's offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 when you buy selected Apple products at full price for today only.\nAfter opting out of Black Friday last year, the deals are more than what people might have been expecting, but the best discounts on Apple products are still through third-party retailers.\nHere's the breakdown:\nMacBooks : Get a $150 Apple Gift Card when you buy a Mac computer, ranging from the cheapest MacBook Air model ($999) to the MacBook Pro's ($1,299-$1,999) — though notably not the new ones with the Touch Bar — or the iMacs ($1,099-$1,499). iPads: Get an $100 Apple gift card when you buy one of three iPads, the Mini 4 ($399), the Air 2 ($399), or the Pro ($599). iPhones: Get a $50 Apple gift card when you buy an iPhone SE ($399), iPhone 6s ($549), or an iPhone 6s Plus ($649). Apple Watch: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy any Apple Watch Series 1 model ($269-$299). Apple TV: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an Apple TV ($149). Apple also wants you to shop the event online — it is offering free delivery on products ordered today, as previously announced, and it has said the best way to shop the event is via the Apple Store app.\nIt looks like Apple is also offering Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, free for three months.\nNOW WATCH: These size comparisons show the true scale of enormous things \n",

      "title": "Apple’s iPhone 8 Might Not Be Designed by Jony Ive",
      "text": "Apple’s iPhone 8 Might Not Be Designed by Jony Ive GO Ive reportedly involved in other projects at Apple Nov 25, 2016 10:16 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Jony Ive was the man to blame for every little design annoyance on the latest iPhone models, but starting with the next year version, you might have to look for someone else to criticize if something doesn’t work exactly as you expected. Ive is reportedly less involved in the iPhone design process these days, as he’s more focused on other projects at the Cupertino company, including the new spaceship campus. Apple watcher and writer Jason Snell revealed during John Gruber’s “The Talk Show” podcast that Jony Ive is no longer directly involved in product design, as the focus is now architecture. “I’ve heard that he has lately been checked out or not as directly involved with product design and that he’s been largely focused on architecture,” Snell said. “Meaning the spaceship campus and the new stores. And that maybe the other top-level executive who’s been working the most with Ive is Angela Arhendts.” Anniversary iPhone without Ive’s touch? Does this mean that the iPhone 8, or whatever the next model will be called, will no longer be the creation of Jony Ive? Possibly, and Gruber said during the podcast that Ive’s involvement in the designing team is just spiritual at the time being. Surprisingly, news of Ive becoming less involved in iPhone design comes at a time when more sources point to major changes on the next-generation model. The 2017 iPhone marks the 10th anniversary of the iPhone, so it’s definitely unexpected to see the leading designer at Apple switching focus to different projects. Rumor has it that the iPhone 8 could come with an all-glass body and metal frame, with Apple also exploring ways to eliminate bezels and introduce OLED screens. Furthermore, there is speculation claiming that the display could incorporate all front-facing parts, such as the FaceTime camera and the Home button, and if this is the case, a truly flawless design is absolutely needed. Of course, this is just speculation for the time being, but as with everything Apple, do not expect a confirmation anytime soon.",

Apple is believed to be launching as many as three iPads next year, and yet another report has added more weight to this notion. Citing ‘Taiwan-based supply chain makers’, Digitimes reports that in addition to the 9.7-inch iPad Air and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, Apple will also be launching a 10.5-inch iPad. In terms of size there’s not a lot of difference between a 9.7-inch and 10.5-inch display, which makes Apple’s decision a tad surprising. But according to the report, “Apple is launching the 10.5-inch iPad mainly because 10-inch and larger tablets have been popular among enterprises and",

      "text": "Updated from Nov. 24 at 9:22 p.m. with new comments from Target\nPeople clamoring for Apple ( AAPL ) iPads, Apple Watches, hoverboards and giant stuffed bears have helped Target ( TGT ) get off to a solid start for the holiday shopping season.\nThe discounter said Friday its holiday season got off to a \"strong\" start, with its Web site having a record-breaking day on Thanksgiving. Traffic and sales beat Cyber Monday last year, according to Target.\n\"I continue to be very optimistic on our position for the holidays,\" Target Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell told TheStreet on a conference call with reporters Thursday evening. Most encouraging, said Cornell, was that people were shopping multiple departments after scooping up the typical Black Friday doorbuster deals.\nCornell cautioned, however, that it remains very early in the holiday season for Target.\nBut what looks to be a good start for the holidays for Target mirrors developments across the retail landscape for early Black Friday openings.\nThanksgiving Day has brought in $1.15 billion in online sales from midnight to 5:00 p.m., a 13.6% increase from a year ago, according to new data Thursday night from Adobe. It's forecasting that Thanksgiving Day will hit, or come close to, $2 billion in online revenue for the first time, which would represent a strong 15.6% from the prior year.\nThe results are based on aggregated and anonymous data from 21 billion visits to retail websites.\nTop-selling products tend to be expensive, noted Adobe, including Samsung 4K televisions, Apple iPads, Macbooks, electric scooters and Sony's ( SNE ) Playstation virtual-reality goggles. The early spending binge by consumers is also being fueled on bigger discounts vs. last year on tablets, toys and appliances.",

      "text": "Apple products next year are likely to support 3D photography from their dual cameras, according to media reports. The stereoscopic imaging capabilities are the result of a joint effort between Apple and LG Innotek. LG has already put a 3D photography capable smartphone in the market, called the LG Optimus 3D P920 .\nThe Korea Economic Daily cites a source who is aware of the developments as saying “Apple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera.” LG Innotek is the exclusive supplier to the dual cameras in the current iPhone 7 Plus. 3D photographs can be viewed in a variety of ways, including head mounted displays or stereoscopic googles. A photo for each eye is needed to create 3D photos.\n\nLast year, Apple acquired an Israeli camera company known as LinX Computational Imaging Limited . The company was developing technologies for dual camera modules in smartphones, that were capable of taking both 2D and 3D photos. Additional capabilities of the cameras included measuring the dimensions of objects and refocusing of photos after the image has been clicked. Refocusing of images after a shot is possible on some dual camera smartphones, such as the Huawei Honour 8 .\nThe post Apple iPhone 8 likely to support 3D photography because of tech developed with LG Innotek appeared first on Tech2 .",

Apple \nApple's pre-announced Black Friday event is here, and it's offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 when you buy selected Apple products at full price for today only. \nAfter opting out of Black Friday last year, the deals are more than what people might have been expecting, but the best discounts on Apple products are still through third-party retailers. \nHere's the breakdown: MacBooks : Get a $150 Apple Gift Card when you buy a Mac computer, ranging from the cheapest MacBook Air model ($999) to the MacBook Pro's ($1,299-$1,999) — though notably not the new ones with the Touch Bar — or the iMacs ($1,099-$1,499). iPads: Get an $100 Apple gift card when you buy one of three iPads, the Mini 4 ($399), the Air 2 ($399), or the Pro ($599). iPhones: Get a $50 Apple gift card when you buy an iPhone SE ($399), iPhone 6s ($549), or an iPhone 6s Plus ($649). Apple Watch: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy any Apple Watch Series 1 model ($269-$299). Apple TV: Get a $25 Apple gift card when you buy an Apple TV ($149). \nApple also wants you to shop the event online — it is offering free delivery on products ordered today, as previously announced, and it has said the best way to shop the event is via the Apple Store app. \nIt looks like Apple is also offering Apple Music, its subscription music-streaming service, free for three months.",

      "text": "These are Apple's Black Friday Deals on MacBook, iPhone, iPad and Watch 7 minutes ago By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 5 minutes ago with 3 comments \nEarlier in the week Apple teased its upcoming Black Friday promotions , without letting anything slip on the actual deals the company was preparing. Well now the day has arrived, so here are the discounts and bonuses that Apple is giving away . \nAfter skipping last year’s Black Friday entirely, now Apple is basing its promotions around a $150 gift card that you can get when purchasing certain devices. That’s the maximum amount of store credit you can get, though it’s proportional to the amount of money you spend, so even lower-priced devices can net you some credit. \nThese are the current Apple Black Friday deals: Get a $150 Apple Gift Card when you buy one of the older MacBooks : anything from the $999 MacBook Air model to the range-topping MacBook Pro at $1999, to regular iMacs up to $1,499. You should note though that the newest MacBooks, the ones with the Touch Bar aren’t eligible. Get a $100 Apple Gift Card when you buy a promotional iPad. These are: the $399 Mini 4, the $399 Air 2 and the $599 Pro. Get a $50 Apple Gift Card when you buy one of the older iPhones, like the $399 iPhone SE, $549 iPhone 6s or $649 iPhone 6s Plus. Get a $25 Apple Gift Card when you buy any Apple Watch Series 1, coming in between $269 and $299. Get a $25 Apple Gift Card when you buy a $149 Apple TV. \nOn top of these deals Apple is also offering a subscription to Apple Music with the first three months free, and free delivery on all the items purchased online today from its store.

      "text": "Reddit \nIf you’re planning on buying an Apple product for someone as a gift – or want to have an extended test-drive yourself before deciding whether or not to keep something – you can safely do so knowing that Apple’s extended Holiday Return Policy is now in effect. \nInstead of the usual 14-day window to return unwanted items, you can now return them for a full refund anytime up to 8th January. Items purchased at the Apple Online Store that are received between November 10, 2016 and December 25, 2016, may be returned through January 8, 2017. Please note that all other terms and conditions provided in the Apple Online Store Sales and Refunds Policy are still applicable with respect to such items purchased. All purchases made after December 25, 2016 are subject to the Standard Return Policy. \nThere are a few exceptions … \nApple lists eight categories of items that are not eligible for return: Opened memory Opened software (can be returned if you reject the licensing terms) Electronic Software Downloads Software Up-to-Date Program Products (software upgrades) Apple Gift Cards Apple Gift Packaging (origami style gift box with ribbon and greeting card) Apple Developer products (membership, technical support incidents, WWDC tickets) \nThe policy applies only to goods purchased directly from Apple (through either online or retail stores ), and you of course need to return the complete kit, including all packaging. \nYou can return products at any Apple Store, or arrange collection via your Order Status page. \nPhoto: Regent Street store, London ( CNET ) Guides",

Apple's Black Friday deals are all about the gift cards   Photo by Apple \nNo, you can't get an iPhone 7 for half price on Black Friday , but Apple is sweetening the deal a little with gift cards when you buy an iPhone , Mac, Watch or iPad . \nBuy a SIM-free 32GB iPhone 6S Plus for £599, $649 or AU$1,079 and you'll receive a £40, $50 or AU$70 Apple Store gift card in return. Maybe you can put it towards a nice case for your new phone. Buying the new iPhone 7 or 7 Plus won't snag you a gift card. \nFancy a new Mac? The super-skinny 256GB MacBook (£1,249, $1,299 or AU$1,999) will see you furnished with a £120, $150 or AU$200 gift card. \nOr for those of you after something to wear, the first-generation Apple Sport Watch (£269, $269 or AU$399) comes with a £20, $25 or AU$35 gift card. \nFor more tech gift picks, see our 2016 Holiday Gift Guide .

And thankfully, thanks to the whispers filling the corridors of the internet, a picture of the tentatively named iPhone 8 is already being building up, Digital Spy said. \nIt already appears to be pretty certain the next handset will switch to an OLED display, but well-known Apple leaker Ming-Chi Kuo has also delivered another report about the upcoming model. \nIn a fresh research note obtained by MacRumors, Kuo indicates that the Cupertino giant will drop an all-glass device in 2017 in order to enable support for wireless charging. \nThis switch will sweep aside any wireless charging issues which can arise with a metal body, and of course return the company to the familiar design of the iPhone 4, which featured a glass rear. \nAs Kuo writes in his note: \"In order to ensure a superior performance, we believe it is most appropriate for EMS suppliers to develop and make the wireless charger because then a comprehensive test can be conducted. \n\"As Hon Hai needs to deploy most resources to develop and produce [an] OLED iPhone, we expect Pegatron will be the exclusive supplier of the wireless charger.\" \nKuo also hinted that the wireless charger could come packaged alongside the iPhone 8, though even he isn't entirely confident in that. \n“Of course, despite his impressive record, there's no guarantee that Kuo's information is accurate. With such a long time to go before anything becomes official, plans are also still subject to change. \nIn other words: add a pinch of salt to any report you hear while simultaneously dreaming of a glass design and wireless charging,” Digital Spy said.

      "text": "eBay, Apple, Google, Startups, FLOR.com Nov 17 eBay ShopBot Now Ready for Holiday Gifting The science behind finding the perfect gift Less than a month ago, I introduced eBay ShopBot , and eBay’s vision for a true AI-powered personal shopping assistant. In the weeks since, we’ve gotten great feedback from our community , and have already rolled out improvements across Natural Language Understanding, Computer Vision, Speed, Search, and Personalization. eBay ShopBot is getting better and smarter every week, thanks to all the shoppers chatting with it. I’m excited to now introduce our latest update, Gifts, a new way to shop for great deals on amazing presents for your loved ones. In our research*, we’ve found that 81% of Americans agree that finding the perfect gift becomes more difficult each year. With eBay ShopBot Gifts, the bot will help you find thoughtful gifts quickly — everything for your mom or dad to the boss. With over a billion items to choose from and updated AI smarts, you’ll definitely find a unique, amazing gift that truly feels like it was made for them, always at a great price. To do this right, we trained eBay ShopBot to understand relationships, so when you ask for a gift for your mom, it understands gender and age ranges, and can help you narrow your focus further to find that perfect gift. We curated collections for the coolest and greatest items on ebay, with an emphasis on the best deals and values. We then trained our AI to know how to make the correlation between these collections and what you are searching for. You can also let it know what price ranges work for you. We are still in Beta, so eBay ShopBot might not get it right every single time, but even in its early stages — eBay ShopBot can help you find pretty amazing gifts. This is what it comes down to: when you’re ready to find a gift, just tell ShopBot who you’re looking for. “I want a gift for my mom.” Or, you can browse our catalog of gift guides, with over 50 different hand-picked collections, making sure you’ve got everyone covered. You can always get to our gift guide through Shop collections in the Messenger menu: And of course we are still very early in our beta, with still more shopping intelligence coming this year for ShopBot! Stay tuned for more updates and behind the scenes discussions at the intersection of commerce and AI. If you haven’t already, say “Hi!” to eBay ShopBot this holiday season. :) * Methodological Notes: The eBay Survey was conducted by Wakefield Research ( www.wakefieldresearch.com ) among 1,000 nationally representative U.S. adults ages 18+, between October 7th and October 13th, 2016, using an email invitation and an online survey. Quotas have been set to ensure reliable and accurate representation of the U.S. adult population ages 18+. Results of any sample are subject to sampling variation. The magnitude of the variation is measurable and is affected by the number of interviews and the level of the percentages expressing the results. For the interviews conducted in this particular study, the chances are 95 in 100 that a survey result does not vary, plus or minus, by more than 3.1 percentage points from the result that would be obtained if interviews had been conducted with all persons in the universe represented by the sample.

      "text": "Read Comments \nRumours have been circulating recently that Apple will debut three new iPad models in 2017, and now a new report claims to have confirmed the company will introduce a 10.5-inch tablet. \nAccording to DigiTimes , which cites 'Taiwan-based supply chain makers', Applewill begin production on the new iPad in December, ahead of the 2017 launch. \nThe as yet unconfirmed iPad will slot between the 9.7-inch iPad Pro and the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, and will reportedly be marketed at enterprises and the education sector. \nRelated: Best Black Friday deals UK \nApple is said to be introducing the new size as the 9.7-inch iPad is thought to be too small for these types of customers, while the 12.9-inch model is too expensive. \nAlongside this new iPad size, the company is said to be planning to launch a lower-price variant of the 9.7-inch iPad to compete with Android rivals, and an enhanced version of the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. \nIn terms of hardware, the 10.5-inch slate will apparently come packing the same A10X chip that will feature in the updated 12.9-inch iPad Pro – a faster version of the impressive chip in the iPhone 7 . \nThe DigiTimes report follows a report from KGI’s Ming-Chi Kuo earlier this year, in which the analyst said the 2017 iPad Pro updates would feature the Apple A10X. \nRelated: Best Apple Black Friday deals UK \nWhat's more, earlier this month Barclays analysts claimed Apple would be debuting three new iPad models, including the new size, in March 2017. \nOf course, there's been no word from Apple so all of this is remains unconfirmed for now. But all the iPad models will be more than a year old come March 2017, so we're certainly expecting something from Apple around that time. \nWATCH: 9.7-inch iPad Pro vs 12.9-inch iPad Pro \nLet us know what you make of the report in the comments. 0 shares",

      "title": "Fully functional ‘Apple Mirror’ will make you wish Apple built crazy stuff",
      "text": "It’s one thing to come up with concepts for Apple products that are just over the horizon, like the iPhone 8, but it’s an entirely different challenge to invent a new iDevice without a predecessor to draw from, and make it actually work. But that’s exactly what Rafael Dymek did with his “Apple Mirror.”\nThe mirror is like a computer display, but with iOS-style icons to launch various apps. A clock and realtime weather hub are situated at the top of the shiny screen, and the apps themselves can be moved around and positioned anywhere on the screen.\nMUST SEE: Verizon has an incredible Black Friday Google Pixel deal\nHowever, as you probably guessed, the apps don’t launch in full-screen glory as they would on an iOS device. Since the mirror is essentially a desktop, all programs appear in windows, which should also allows for easy multitasking.\nApps like Uber, Netflix, Facebook Messenger, Sonos and Twitter are all fully functional on the conceptual device, and the entire setup seems to work quite well, albeit with a bit of touchscreen input delay. The mirror automatically goes to sleep after 45 seconds of inactivity, and wakes back up with a tap on the screen.\nDymek notes that he choose to create an Apple-inspired smart mirror simply for his own enjoyment. “I admire Apple’s vision and approach to creating revolutionary products,” he writes. “My only goal for this project was to create something useful that I could see myself using.”\nThe Apple Mirror certainly isn’t the first smart mirror to tease the internet. An Uber-hailing digital mirror popped up earlier this year, using a similar approach and layout.\nTrending right now:\nCyber Monday plans for Kohl’s, Sears, and Kmart revealed Watch the Almond 3 smart home router system murder your Wi-Fi dead spots A single miscalculation sent ESA’s Mars lander crashing into the Red Planet See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Apple\nRestoring thousands of manufacturing jobs to the United States’ struggling Rust Belt communities was one of President-Elect Donald Trump’s biggest campaign promises, and at least one major technology company is considering following through. According to The New York Times and Nikkei Asian Review , iPhone maker Apple has begun exploring the possibility of moving smartphone production to the United States.\nMore: Apple scales back production of iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, expects lower sales in 2016\nIn an interview with The New York Times published on Wednesday, Trump recounted a phone conversation with Tim Cook during which he urged the CEO to move part of Apple’s production line to the U.S.:\n“I was honored yesterday, I got a call from Bill Gates, great call, we had a great conversation, I got a call from Tim Cook at Apple, and I said, ‘Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you’re making your product right here.’ He said, ‘I understand that.’ I said: ‘I think we’ll create the incentives for you, and I think you’re going to do it. We’re going for a very large tax cut for corporations, which you’ll be happy about.’”\nTrump is a vocal supporter of U.S. companies that build their products in the U.S., and has proposed levying steep tariffs — potentially as high as 45 percent — on competing Chinese importers.\nMore: Apple’s “touch disease” repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus is not free\nNikkei, citing a source familiar with Apple’s plans, reports that the Cupertino, California-based company has tasked Foxconn and Pegatron, the two tech firms responsible for assembling more than 200 million of Apple’s iPhones annually, with investigating the feasibility of building plants in the U.S.\n“We’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of other countries,” Trump said in a speech in January. “How does it help us when they make it in China?”\nPegatron reportedly demurred, citing logistical concerns. Foxconn agreed to compile report as soon as June, but company chairman Terry Gou warned that it would show drastically higher productions costs. The potential result? An iPhone made in the U.S. could retail for as much as anywhere between $740 and $1,300 for a 32GB iPhone 7 versus $650 today, according to Nikkei.\nApple has previously declined to move iPhones production stateside, citing costs.\nQuestion: Would you pay $80 more for your next iPhone if you knew it was Made in the USA?\n— Jeremy Kaplan (@SmashDawg) November 18, 2016\nA thorough report in the MIT Technology Review found that moving iPhone assembly to the U.S. would add $30 to $40 to the cost of an iPhone thanks to “transportation and logistics expenses [that] would arise from shipping parts.”\nMore: Superior silicon: How Apple is beating chipmakers at their own game\nManufacturing the smartphone’s hundreds of components domestically is an even pricier — and vastly more complex — proposition. Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook told CBS’ 60 Minutes in December 2015 that the U.S. labor pool lacked the skills necessary to carry out iPhone production, and Apple executives have estimated that it would take as long as nine months to recruit the roughly 8,700 industrial engineers that oversee Chinese assembly lines. And that’s before efficiency is taken into account: A 2012 CNN Money report noted that Chinese factories house workers in employee dormitories and “can send hundreds of thousands to the assembly lines at a moment’s notice.”\nThen there’s the U.S.’s lack of natural resources to consider. MIT Technology Review points out that few of the 75 elements required to manufacture the iPhone are available commercially in the U.S. Aluminum, for instance, requires bauxite, and there are no bauxite mines in the U.S. China, on the other hand, produces 85 percent of the world’s rare earth metals.\nMore: Spendy but indispensable: Breaking down the full $650 cost of the iPhone 5\nFurther complicating matters is Apple’s sprawling supply chain of more than 750 firms in over 20 countries. Taiwan Semiconductor produces crucial iPhone chips; South Korea’s SK Hynix and Japan’s Toshiba produce the handset’s memory modules; and Japan’s Japan Display and Sharp provide the iPhone’s display. “To make iPhones, there will need to be a cluster of suppliers in the same place, which the U.S. does not have at the moment,” an industry executive familiar with iPhone production told economics blog NorthCrane .\nBut Apple’s plan isn’t without precedent. In 2013, Motorola Mobility employed more than 3,800 employees to assemble the Moto X, a flagship Android phone, at a factory in Fort Worth, Texas. Just a year later, though, it was forced to shutter production as a result of “exceptionally tough” market conditions, according to Motorola president Rick Osterloh. The company subsequently moved production to China.\napple iphone manufacturing More Apple\nOthers have been more successful. Foxconn established a stateside iMac computer assembly line in 2012. A year later, Singapore-based Flextronics, manufacturer of Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computer, built a production line in Austin, Texas.\nMore: When will the iPhone use an OLED screen? Here are all the rumors\nIn October 2015, Sharp president Tai Jeng-wu suggested that if Apple were to begin producing smartphones in the United States, it would likely follow suit. “We are now building a new [advanced organic light-emitting diode] facility in Japan. We can make [OLED panels] in the U.S. too,” he said. “If our key customer demands us to manufacture in the U.S., is it possible for us not to do so?”\nBut China’s reaction could be severe. In an opinion piece published in a state-backed newspaper, the Chinese government warned of retaliatory measures if such trade restrictions were to go into effect. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,” a Global Times article read.\nView photos\nTim-Cook (1) More A move of production by Apple could also threaten the company’s relationship with Chinese leadership. Earlier this year, in what was widely seen as a protectionist move by regulators, Apple’s iBooks and iMovies were temporarily blocked within the country. And in June, China’s Beijing-based intellectual Property Office found that Apple’s iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus infringed on a design patent held by Chinese company Shenzhen Baili.\nApple has extended olive branches in recent months. The company invested $1 billion in China-based ridesharing app Didi Chuxing. It’ll open its first research and development facility in the country — a $45 million office within Beijing’s Zhongguancun Science Park — by the end of this year. And in October, it pledged to build a second facility in China’s Shenzhen province.\nMore: Apple planning a second research and development center in China\nEven if Apple were to move iPhone production to the U.S., it likely wouldn’t be enough to stem the country’s losses. Foxconn employed roughly 690,000 workers in China as of the end of April, down slightly from a peak of 1.3 million in 2012. The Economic Policy Institute, a U.S. think tank, estimated that the U.S. had lost five million manufacturing jobs between 2000 and 2014.\nBut politics may trump economics in the end. U.S. automaker Ford may prove the precursor of developments to come: On Friday, the company shelved plans to move production of its Lincoln crossover SUV from Kentucky to Mexico. “The Apple supply chain must treat Trump’s campaign pledge seriously and not write it off,” an industry executive told NorthCrane.\nArticle originally published in November 2016.

This is good on the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 6s Plus only. Get an Apple Gift Card worth up to $100 when you buy an iPad Pro, iPad Air 2, or iPad mini 4.

      "text": ":49 Apple is selling a pretentious coffee table book for $300 One of the latest Apple products, a $300 book, might be one of their strangest. It contains just pictures of Apple products, so this is probably only to appeal to diehard fans of the company. :59 You won't be able to recognize these everyday objects in extreme closeup Using a macro lens, photographers can zoom in and get incredibly detailed shots of everyday objects. From these points of view, routine items are basically unrecognizable. :42 Even Tom Brady's diet would break you You might think you'd love to live Tom Brady's life, but just based on the Patriots star's diet, it doesn't sound like that much fun. He doesn't just avoid obvious things like sweets, there are even some types of vegetables that don't make the cut. 2:20 Celebrate Thanksgiving with these dancing grannies At the 2014 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, a dance team of elderly ladies absolutely stole the show. Meet the Red Hot Mamas, an eccentric and badass group of women from Coeur d'Alene, Idaho, whose goal is \"the enhancement of the ridiculous.\" 1:19 Extreme scenes of violence keep emerging from Standing Rock Protesters at the Standing Rock Reservation have had to deal with extreme measures being used against them. One woman, who was handing out water bottles, was allegedly hit in the arm with a concussion grenade and may now face amputation. :33 Deep-frying your turkey might create a giant fireball Deep-frying a turkey is a great way to cook a moist and delicious dinner, but it's actually much harder than it looks. If it isn't prepared correctly, things can actually get dangerous. :36 Is there a deer in the driver's seat of that ATV?! A hunter in Michigan decided to display one of his kills in an unusual way. He propped the deer up in an ATV, attached the ATV to his truck, then drove around with a setup that made it look like the deer was out for a joyride. :45 This burger bun is full of hot liquid cheese that will explode when you bite it Typically, filling food with cheese is a good thing, but this particular burger goes too far. This new burger bun from New York is full of hot, liquid cheese that might explode out of the bun when you take the first bite. :43 This little kid wants some \"f−−−ing pudding\" In the second verse of \"We Wish You A Merry Christmas,\" there's a line that refers to \"figgy pudding.\" Unfortunately, this little kid misheard the lyrics and sings a much more offensive version of this song. 1:12 Donald Trump's bizarre acting resume includes him hitting on Rudy Giuliani in drag Before being elected the leader of the free world, Donald Trump was the go-to guy for movies and TV shows that needed a generic rich guy to make a cameo. Trump's acting credits are mostly those types of roles, but there was also the time he starred in a sketch where he hit on Rudy Giuliani while New York's mayor dressed in drag. ",

      "title": "Leading developer Lightricks launches Facetune 2.0 to leverage Apple’s app subscription model",
      "text": "Lightricks has released a new version of its popular Facetune app that may get as much attention for its new business model as the suite of new features.\nWith Facetune 2.0, the Israel-based developer is beginning a shift away from the paid download model that has propelled its indie success and toward the subscription model that Apple made available earlier this year to all developers in the App Store. With Facetune , the self-portrait editing app, and Enlight , a broader image-editing app , Lightricks has consistently ranked high on the lists of best-selling paid apps for the Apple App Store in recent years.\nWith the shift from a one-time payment model toward a recurring revenue stream and a new relationship with users, Lightricks is betting that it can leverage Apple’s new rules to grow at a dramatically faster clip.\n“The mobile software landscape needs to shift away from free or small one-time payment models in order for developers to support sustainable R&D at a scale that continually delivers the newest and highest-grade experience to users,” said Zeev Farbman, cofounder and CEO of Lightricks, in a statement. “We are hoping that Apple’s new subscription model is going to do just that — enable tool makers to thrive on iOS, fostering the same kind of category defining software companies built during the desktop era.”\nWith Facetune 2.0, Lightricks is rolling out a wide set of new features. These include:\nFace : This feature is driven by an artificial intelligence engine to let users reshape their faces while adjusting the proportions to make sure the changes fit naturally.\nLive Preview: The app’s built-in camera includes this augmented reality features that lets users see what editing effects such as teeth whitening and skin smoothing will look like before they actually snap the photo.\nRelight: The app’s AI engine lets users extend their control of the lighting environment with simple finger swipes.\nBut just as critical, users will be able to download the app for free, try new features, and buy them individually. Or users can subscribe to the app to access all the features, as well as all new features added in the future.\nThe new version will be available worldwide on November 25, but prices for features and subscriptions will vary from country to country. However, in the U.S., subscriptions prices are expected to be $3.99 per month, $14.99 for six months, $19.99 annually at the beginning.\nJust prior to its Worldwide Developer Conference this summer, Apple announced that it will now allow all developers to use a subscription model, something that had existed previously for only a few select publishers and developers. In addition, Apple offered a new incentive: If a developer maintains a paying subscriber for at least a year, Apple will reduce its split from 30 percent to 15 percent.\nOver time, that offers a chance for more stable revenue and a deeper relationship with customers for companies like Lightricks. But it’s not without risk.\nAfter all, Lightricks was able to earn enough from its paid download model to bootstrap itself for two years before raising a round of $10 million of venture capital in 2015, its first outside funding.\nBut if the Lightricks and others can make this leap to subscriptions, the new revenue model may allow them to grow in ways that lets them match the size and strength of companies that built their businesses on desktop computing software. For Apple, the hope is that the new model continues to attract the best developers with greater incentives to create better experiences for iOS users rather than Android.\nhttp://venturebeat.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Portrait_V1.mp4 ",

Apple iPhone 7 - £79.99 upfront \nDiscounts on the new iPhone 7 can be hard to come by, but Carphone Warehouse has slashed the upfront cost of the device by £150. The deal includes a 32GB phone, 1,000 minutes and unlimited texts, as well as 2GB of data. The contract runs on the EE network with 24 monthly payments of £33.49. \nForbes were particularly impressed with the improved camera on the new flagship iPhone, saying the feature helps it \"step into the limelight\" and that \"the gap has closed\" on the best on the market. Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge - £59.99 upfront \nCarphone Warehouse have taken £200 off the upfront cost of a new Samsung Galaxy S6 Edge . The offer comes with 500MB of data, 500 minutes and unlimited texts on a contract Vodafone, with 24 monthly payments of £19.00. \nThe handset is \"stunning\" and \"a thing of beauty,\" says TechRadar , and will appeal to those who \"want a really unique-looking device\". Google Pixel and VR Headset - £9.99 upfront \nEE has dropped the upfront payment on the new Google Pixel from £79.99 to £9.99. A 24-month contract at £45.99 per month gets you a 32GB device with unlimited texts and calls and 5GB of data - plus Google's £69 Daydream VR headset. \nThe Pixel is Google's answer to the premium mobile market, battling the likes of Apple's iPhone and the Samsung Galaxy series . However, it is \"noticeably faster than a Galaxy S7\", says The Verge , and it and its big brother the Pixel XL are \"the best Android phones you can buy\". \nSign up for our daily newsletter Newsletter",

      "text": "  \nI don't get to write a lot of obituaries. \nActually, part of my first newspaper job was taking obits over the phone in the days before the internet. \nToday, I'm writing an obit for Apple's AirPort wireless routers. \nApple has disbanded the AirPort router team, according to multiple media reports. \nYou can still buy AirPort products -- from a $99 AirPort Express to the $399 AirPort Time Capsule with a 3TB backup drive. \nApple hasn't updated its AirPort line since 2013, but they were good products. \nNow comes news there won't be any more. If you want one, you better act soon. \nI was at the Apple announcement when Steve Jobs introduced the original iBook that showed off a new technology called AirPort. \nBack in those days, Wi-Fi was not built-in; you had to install an optional wireless card in your computer. \nApple called its Wi-Fi products AirPort, and it released an AirPort wireless base station, which was my very first Wi-Fi router. \nThe AirPort base station looked like a flying saucer, and it worked well. \nI used Apple AirPort products for the next 15 years or so because they just worked well with all of Apple's Wi-Fi-enabled products. \nHeck, Apple doesn't make very many products that don't include Wi-Fi. \nBut now you'll have to get your Wi-Fi router elsewhere. \nThat's not a bad thing, though. I moved on from AirPort routers a few years back. \nThere are better routers available from companies like Netgear, D-Link, Eero, Ubiquiti, Google and a ton more. \nThese routers have more power, offer easy network expansion, and are cheaper. \nIt seems like Apple realized there were better choices, and it might as well concentrate itsresources on other projects. \nApple recently made the same decision about its external monitors as well. \nI can't say I blame Apple for eliminating AirPort routers and monitors. Not too many people will even miss them, but it still makes me a little sad. View Comments",

      "text": "Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window) \nTech giant Apple’s 2016 holiday commercial starring Frankenstein’s monster captures the essence of the holiday spirit. \nAs a shunned outcast, it seems the monster has found sanctuary in outlying cabin in the mountains. After a brief glimpse of what appears to be a tip of the hat to his Victorian creator (a photo of what appears to be an image of author Mary Shelley), “Frankie” has just recorded a short holiday music box tune on his iPhone and heads into the village. Of course the villagers appear repulsed by the towering creature as he approaches an outdoor Christmas tree. Attaching one red and one green bulb to the bolts on his neck, an apprehensive and very lonely looking monster pushes play on his phone. Timidly managing to utter the first phrase of 1954 Christmas classic “(No Place Like) Home for the Holidays”, the monster pauses, one of the holiday lights have also gone out. . . \nWhat happens next sells this touching message of acceptance and tolerance in last few seconds of this compelling commercial. Not only is it a perfect turnaround from the original story’s premise that the real monster is man (and not the creation), but a perfect note for the end of this turbulent 2016. \nWatch for yourself and let us know what you think:",

      "text": "Apple's Black Friday sales aren't exactly anything to get excited about; iPhones are still full price, but Apple will toss in a $50 gift card if you buy the year-old models.

      "text": "Reddit \nAs Black Friday approaches, the 9to5Toys team has been working diligently to find the best deals leading up to the biggest deal day of the year. While the Toys team covers all of the big deals and new gear from the retailers you trust, we’re paying particular attention to Apple Deals here. \nFirst, you’ll want to be sure that you’re following 9to5Toys on Twitter , RSS and Facebook for all of the latest deals as they pop up. This is important because retailers have gotten tricky with their Black Friday deals and the best deals often only last minutes at a time. Second, you don’t want to leave your computer on Black Friday. The best deals are online. Waiting in lines and wrestling HDTVs from Black Friday Deal shoppers is for suckers. \nAs you likely know, Apple rarely does Black Friday deals (although that may be changing! ). However, third-party retailers like Amazon , Best Buy , B&H , eBay , Walmart, Target and others are offering aggressive discounts. Head below for a look at our top picks for the season so far… iPad \nApple opted to not refresh its iPad lineup this fall, so much of its offerings are available at a discount this holiday season. iPad Pro and iPad mini 4 are bound to be the most sought after of the lot. Discounts vary by retailers, but you’re likely to find some savings this week.",

      "text": "Comment There have been a number of reports about the new iPad Apple is set to release next year. Now, sources told DigiTimes that Apple will be launching a 10.5-inch iPad in 2017, with the production set to begin next month. A Taiwan-based supply chain maker also shared that lower-priced version of 9.7-inch iPads will also be released to compete against Android tablets. Anita Ritenour via Flickr \nThere have been a number of reports regarding Apple's iPad line-up next year. The recent one comes from a Taiwan-based supply chain makers. According to these sources, the tech giant will be launching a 10.5-inch iPad in 2017. In fact, the production for this iPad is set to begin next month. \nDigiTimes first broke this news on their website. Their sources revealed that choice of the size was the result of the popularity and demand for 10-inch and larger tablets. Apparently, these tablets are a hit among enterprises and the education sector in the US. Such preference might be caused by the fact that some customers find the 9.7-inch iPad too small. Normally, they would want a bigger one like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. However, that would mean they need to pay more since it's more expensive. \nThe sources also disclosed that the 10.5-inch iPad will be powered by A10X, the same one as in the 12.9-inch iPad Pro. It is expected that the sales for new iPad will \"reach two million units\" in the first quarter of 2017 and \"5 to 6 million units\" for the whole year. The other news is Apple's plan of releasing a lower priced 9.7-inch iPad. This is the company's strategy in competing against Android-based tablets. It will be powered by the A9X chipset like with the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, according to GSM Arena . \nRumors about a 10-inch iPad have been going around for some time already. The release date of 2017 was mentioned back in August. According to Mac Rumors , Japanese website Mac Otakara said in October that it will be a new 10.1-inch iPad Pro. The site added that it will be unveiled in early 2017. The last report about it prior to this one was earlier this month. Mac Rumors reported that Barclays analysts have claimed that Apple will release a \"10.9-inch\" iPad that is bezel-free. Furthermore, there might also be a refreshed 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch iPads. \nNow, it seemed that this recent report is more plausible. Mac Rumors mentioned that KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo already suggested back in August about a 10.5-inch tablet that is powered by A10X. In addition, Kuo added that Apple will launch lower-price versions of the 9.7-inch iPad to compete with Android models. All of these corroborate with what have been said by DigiTimes' Taiwan-based supply chain maker sources. \nThe only detail missing in the latest news is what Kuo mentioned with regards to a more \"revolutionary\" change to iPads or Apple devices that include iPhones. It's the decision to finally use OLED displays instead of the usual LCD. This new display technology integrated into iPads may be expected in 2018, according to Kuo.",

Those issues can be improved with the right combination of good-for-you ingredients. \nRelated: Easy breakfast! 4 healthy smoothie bowl recipes to start your morning right \nHere are some drinks I’ve designed to help you feel your absolute rockstar best as the new year kicks into high gear. Not everyone has a juicer, so these smoothies are designed to be whipped up in your blender. Plus, that means that all of the filling fiber from the fruits and veggies is retained (more details on all that good stuff in the recipes below), which will help if your skinny jeans are feeling tighter than they did before all this holiday business started.",

      "text": "Shutterstock November 25, 2016 | 09:27AM PT \nApple ’s long love-have relationship with Black Friday continues with a bunch of deals that involve — surprise — full-priced items: Instead of reducing the sticker price, Apple decided to give consumers gift cards as rebates. \nThat’s a bit disappointing, especially considering that you’d still have to pay taxes on the full price. Then again, it’s better than last year, when Apple decided to skip Black Friday altogether. \nIn any case, here are some of the deals Apple listed on the Black Friday section of its website : Rebates on iPhones: The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6S Plus ($549 / $649 and up unlocked) come with a $50 gift card. The iPhone SE ($399 and up unlocked) gets you a $25 gift card. Rebates on iPads: iPad Pro models ($599 and up) come with a $100 gift card. iPad Air and iPad mini purchases ($399 and up) will get you a $50 gift card. Apple TV rebate: Consumers who buy an Apple TV ($149 and up) get a $25 gift card. Apple Watch rebate : Apple is giving buyers of the Apple Watch 1 a $25 gift card. \nApple’s site also lists rebate deals for select Macbooks and desktop computers. However, it’s worth pointing out that the company isn’t having any deals for its new flagship phone, the iPhone 7. \nIt’s also worth noting that you may be able to get better deals on some of those products elsewhere. Target, for example, is selling select Apple Watch 1 models for $199 on Black Friday. For a more complete list of deals, also check out our Black Friday deals guide.",

      "text": "Details \nThe 13.3\" MacBook Air Notebook Computer from Apple is an ultraportable notebook computer with a thin and lightweight design. Apple’s engineers have leveraged the lessons they learned in designing the miniaturized iPad and applied them to the design of this 2.96-pound computer. The system is loaded with 128GB of flash storage rather than an old-fashioned hard drive. Flash storage doesn’t just give you a lighter, thinner computer. It also allows for impressive battery life — up to 12 hours of web browsing and 30 days of standby time. \nThe MacBook Air is housed in an aluminum unibody enclosure, which is as strong as it is light. Because it is cut from a solid block of aluminum, the housing is stronger than those found on laptops built via traditional means. \nAt 13.3\" in size, the 16:9 display features a native resolution of 1440 × 900. It features a glossy finish and LED backlight technology for enhanced image quality and energy efficiency. \nFeatures & Specifications: Processor: 1.4GHz Intel Core i5 Dual-Core Memory: 4GB of Onboard 1600MHz LPDDR3 RAM Solid State Drive: 128GB PCIe-Based Flash Storage Operating System: Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan 13.3\" LED -Backlit Glossy Display",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nYou'll find better iPad, Apple Watch and MacBook deals at partner distributors than on Apple.com\nApple Inc. devices are proving popular this Black Friday weekend, but iPads and Watches are actually cheaper at Apple's big-box retail partners than they are when bought directly from the manufacturer, which is hosting its own one-day online shopping event.\nEarlier this week, Apple (AAPL) announced that it would be hosting a one-time shopping event the Friday after Thanksgiving after skipping the event in 2015. Details on the company's ad for the event were scarce, but Apple teased it with a photo of the Apple Watch, spurring rumors that it might discount hardware, a break from the past practice of offering deals on gift cards. The company also teased free two-day shipping, mirroring Amazon Prime (AMZN) and certain partner distributors.\nOpinion: Why Black Friday sales aren't for the truly frugal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-black-friday-sales-are-not-for-the-truly-frugal-2016-11-20)\nThis year, however, proved to be more of the same, with Apple offering Apple gift cards on select products bought at full price. In other words, a shopper spends just as much money now as they would have yesterday on certain devices to get a store discount for a later purchase. But even after subtracting the Apple gift card from the regular retail price, certain devices are actually cheaper at Best Buy Co. (BBY) and Target Corp. (TGT) today than they are shopping directly at Apple.com.\nAlso Read:Apple products and TVs the big drivers for Target's Thanksgiving sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-products-and-tvs-are-the-big-drivers-for-targets-thanksgiving-sales-2016-11-25)\nWhen taking advantage of Apple's deals, a full-price iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus yields a $50 gift card; a full-price iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4 comes with a $100 gift card; a full-priced Apple Watch Series 1 includes a $25 gift card; and a full-priced MacBook, MacBook Pro 13-inch, MacBook Pro 15-inch; MacBook Air and iMac yields a $150 gift card.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/fHOgRV4WCcl)\nBreaking this down further, the iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi 32-gigabyte costs $274.99 at Best Buy and $274 at Target, compared with $399 at Apple, or $349 when including the $50 gift card.\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 rose gold model with a sport band is $219 at Best Buy and $198 at Target, compared with $269 at Apple, or $244 when including the $25 gift card.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB of memory is $1,099.99 at Best Buy and $1,149 at New York-based consumer tech retailer B&H, compared with $1,299 at Apple, or $1,149 when including the gift card. The MacBook isn't sold at Target.\nAlso See:Dow, S&P 500 hit new record in quiet postholiday trading (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-poised-for-fresh-record-highs-black-friday-boost-in-view-2016-11-25)\nThe only time going straight to Apple is better is if you're buying an older-model iPhone. The iPhone 6s Plus 32GB rose gold, for example, is $649 at Apple.com, or $599 including the gift card. That's compared with a retail price of $699.99 at Best Buy.\nFor the iPhone 7, however, the deal is better at Best Buy, with Apple selling its newest iPhone at full price and Best Buy offering discounts and e-gift cards on certain models. The iPhone 7 black 128GB, for example, is $36.58 a month for 24 months with the iPhone upgrade program, or $749 retail when purchased at Apple.com, whereas Best Buy is offering it for $31.25 a month for 24 months along with a $100 Best Buy e-gift card.\nAlso Read:U.S. online sales tally more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-online-sales-tally-more-than-1-billion-on-thanksgiving-day-2016-11-25)\nApple has been trying to boost device sales after suffering recent declines in hardware, which are its largest source of revenue. The company reported its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales last month. This has prompted the company in recent months to shift the conversation on its earnings conference calls to services, which now make more money than the Mac family, while analysts have started to question the company's ability to innovate on pace with its biggest rivals (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-faces-decade-of-uncertainty-after-next-years-iphone-2016-11-21)in certain areas such as augmented reality and television. The company's much-hyped BlueTooth AirPods (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-will-lose-your-159-apple-airpods-says-everyone-on-the-internet-2016-09-07), meanwhile, still aren't available.\nShares of Apple rose 0.3% to $111.52 in late-morning trade Friday, while those of Best Buy fell 0.3% to $46.83 and Target's rose 0.4% to $78.79 -- all on unusually light volume given the holiday.\nApple's shares have risen 3.7% in the past three months, but remain down 5.5% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , meanwhile, is up 3.7% in the past three months and up 7.4% in the past year. The S&P 500 has gained 8% on the year.\n-Jennifer Booton;\n 1203ET\n ",

(Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) \nApple jumped into the Black Friday deal frenzy Friday, teasing customers with gift cards on some items. \nIf you're looking for deals on a new iPhone, Apple Watch, MacBook or iPad, however, you may score better bargains by skipping Apple's own stores. At Apple stores: gift cards \nSimilar to past years, Apple is throwing in Apple Store gift cards as its Black Friday promotion in what the company is referring to as its \"one-day shopping event.\" \nThose buying the Apple Watch Series 1 or Apple TV will get $25 gift cards. IPhone 6S, 6 and SE buyers will get $50 gift cards, and those purchasing an iPad Pro, Air 2 or Mini 4 tablet will receive $100 gift cards. There are no discounts on pricing and no deals for the company's latest products, the Apple Watch Series 2 and iPhone 7. \nApple is similarly not incentivizing purchases of its latest MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, instead only offering $150 gift cards for the older MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro. Three gifts to avoid buying this holiday \nThe Apple Store is, however, embracing some other Black Friday offers, matching other retailers in offering the Sonos Play 1 speaker for $149.95, a $50 savings. It is also throwing in three months of Apple Music (a $30 value) with the purchase of a Sonos Play 1 or Play 5 system. Target, Best Buy have Apple deals \nFor those looking for the latest in Apple gear, your best bet is to look elsewhere. Target has the iPad Air 2 32GB for as low as $274.99, $125 cheaper than Apple's price. Target also is offering the Apple Watch Series 1 for as low as $198 for the 38mm version, $80 cheaper than at Apple. Skip the lines—these are the BEST online Black Friday deals \nFor the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a variety of carriers and retailers are offering promotions if you're willing to buy a monthly payment plan. Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are all throwing in $250 gift cards when purchased at their stores, while many carriers have deals in place to get an iPhone 7 for free.

      "title": "Apple nabs obscene share of smartphone profit thanks to Samsung’s Note 7 debacle - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Apple Inc. took a record majority of world-wide smartphone profit share in the third quarter as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. plunged in the wake of the disastrous Note 7 recall.\nIn the quarter, which included Samsung’s first and second recalls and the discontinuation of the exploding Note 7’s production , Samsung’s 005930, +0.00% global profit share fell from nearly a third, 31.2% in the prior quarter, to absolutely nothing. That sent the profit share of its largest competitor, Apple AAPL, +0.50% , to a record 91%, compared with 62.2% in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Rounding out the top four in terms of profitability were three Chinese companies: Huawei, Vivo and OPPO, though their shares were all under 2.5%.\nRead also: Here’s how much Apple may profit from Samsung’s exploding phone disaster\nSamsung’s share of total industry profits is expected to rebound in 2017 as it continues to move past the recall and associated costs, according to Linda Sui, director of wireless smartphone strategies at Strategy Analytics, a consumer electronics trends tracker.\nApple typically holds a larger share of profits because of its ability to charge industry-leading premium prices on devices. Samsung is the bigger revenue generator in the smartphone market overall, though, because of its larger world-wide user base.\nBoth Apple and Samsung suffered year-over-year smartphone sales declines last quarter, while Samsung held on to its industry-leading share of world-wide revenues, according to IDC. Many analysts suspected that iOS would benefit from a flurry of Android switchers in the wake of the exploding phone saga, but many users seem to have stuck with Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL, +0.16% GOOG, +0.09% Android operating system, fleeing to either Samsung’s other Galaxy phones or Android devices offered by rival manufacturers like HTC Corp. 2498, -0.96% and LG Electronics Inc. 066570, -0.43%\nSee also: Why everything from Samsung phones to hoverboards is literally exploding\nSamsung shipped 72.5 million phones in the third quarter, for 20% revenue share, while Apple sold 45.5 million phones, giving it 12.5% share, according to IDC. By revenue, Samsung is the largest smartphone manufacturer, followed by Apple, Huawei, OPPO then Vivo.\nThe Note 7 debacle is the primary reason for the huge decline in Samsung’s smartphone profitability last quarter, but that is viewed by analysts largely as a temporary hiccup that the South Korean company will overcome in the coming quarters.\nPhone Fiasco Slashes Samsung Profit (1:38) Samsung’s botched launch and recall of its Galaxy Note 7 smartphone contributed to a 16.8% drop in third-quarter net profit, with more earnings effects ahead. Photo: AP\n“Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost” has given iPhone the ability to “generate monster profits,” Sui said. “The Note 7 recall significantly cracked Samsung smartphone profit margin this quarter. [But] we expect Samsung will come back in 2017.”\nIn a late-October survey taken by IDC, analysts said Samsung faces some short-term challenges but “nothing that will darken its long-term prospects.”\n“Although the recall may have an adverse impact on the brand in the short term, the truth is that Samsung remains the clear market leader world-wide,” said Anthony Scarsella, research manager in IDC’s mobile phones unit.\nRead also: Apple faces decade of uncertainty after next year’s iPhone\nIn late October, Samsung reported a nearly 17% decline in net profit to 4.54 trillion Korean won ($4 billion), with the vast majority of the declines coming from its mobile unit, which recorded a 96% plunge in operating profit . The company said it anticipated another 3.5 trillion won in expenses from the recall in the last three months of 2016 and the first three months of 2017. But costs are expected to subside by the middle of next year.\nMeanwhile, Samsung benefits from many other products outside of its mobile unit that insulated the company from an even bigger decline in profits. The company’s display panels earned 1.02 trillion won last quarter, a 10% year-over-year increase, while semiconductors and display panels accounted for 84% of Samsung’s overall operating profit, the highest level in several years.\nMore from MarketWatch No Official White House Roles for Trump's Children Oil prices fall but salvage weekly gain in run-up to OPEC meeting My stepmother inherited my father’s estate when he died — I want my fair share",

      "title": "Bragi's 'Headphone' takes on Apple's AirPods",
      "text": "Almost three years ago, Bragi left an indelible mark on the headphone universe. The then-unknown company launched a pair of \"truly\" wireless headphones on Kickstarter that not only cut every wire, but boasted a slew of fitness-tracking features, all wrapped in a superslick design.\nBragi delivered on its promise , releasing the Dash this summer , but with a few compromises. The fitness features weren't comprehensive enough to be valuable, the microphone wasn't great, and even basic connectivity with phones wasn't very stable. You can't have bleeding edge without a few cuts, though, right?\nEnter \" the Headphone .\" These $149 buds look a lot like the Dash, but are a much simpler proposition. The Headphone drops nearly all the smart features, and the result is arguably the product Bragi should have launched originally: a solid pair of truly wireless headphones. The Dash was definitely an impressive opening act, though, and perhaps necessary to earn the company the gravitas to be taken seriously.\nThe very first thing I noticed about the Headphone is that the build feels cheap compared to the Dash. The Headphone comes in a light plastic case -- not a cold, weighty metal one this time. There's no battery in that case either; it just serves as a charging cradle (and case, obviously). The Dash's smooth, touch-sensitive controls have been replaced by physical buttons on the right bud. There's also no app connectivity with the Headphone, and no onboard storage for music. So why bother? Well, there's at least three very good reasons: connectivity, battery life and price.\nBragi defined the truly wireless headphones category, and many competitors soon emerged. Remarkably, all of them -- almost without exception -- suffered some form of connectivity hiccup. This could be between the buds themselves, or between the headphones and your phone when outside (an issue with the Dash). Some cheaper products presented both problems.\nWith the Headphone, connectivity issues have vanished -- even outside walking with your phone deep in your pocket. The Dash is very sensitive, and if you have your phone in the wrong pocket, music would suffer dropouts. With the Headphone, I've had the odd minor glitch while turning my head to look for traffic crossing a road, with the phone in the opposite pocket.\nThe audio connectivity isn't just better than the Dash; it's better than any \"truly\" wireless buds I've tried (Erato's Apollo 7 and Earin , to name a few). Importantly, the Headphone's buds never lost connection with each other either -- a common problem with these products. Best of all, unlike similar headsets, Bragi didn't use a design with something hanging out of your ears (looking at you, AirPods ) to help ensure good connectivity. Like the Dash, the Headphone sits flush in your ear, making them much more inconspicuous.\nOne downside to the physical buttons is that they require quite a push to register a click, so you're basically mashing the earbud into your ear each time, which can feel uncomfortable. This mashing effect happens with all three buttons on the right bud. It's a relatively minor annoyance, as you can always use your phone to control the volume, but it's something to get used to.\nThe lack of fitness features on the Headphone isn't a problem, as there are many other ways to track activity. But I did love the ability to load music onto the Dash and leave my phone at home when going for a run. Not many truly wireless buds offer this -- Samsung's Iconx is one of the others -- but it's a feature that elevates the usefulness of wireless earbuds, especially when music streaming might not be convenient.\nA feature the Headphone does have is the \"transparency\" mode that Bragi helped pioneer. Transparency uses the microphone to blend ambient noise around you (traffic, people talking, etc.) with your music. Handy when you don't want to stop your music, say when buying a coffee. But also a potential lifesaver for cyclists who gotta have their tunes on the ride to work.\nIt's definitely a welcome addition to the Headphone's relatively basic feature set, but for some reason, the ambient noise doesn't seem to be quite as audible as it is on the Dash in the same conditions. My doorbell pierces through much less on the Headphone while listening at moderate volume, and sometimes I had to remove a bud to engage in conversation, which is less common with the Dash. Perhaps Bragi reconfigured it the second time around.\nMore important, music sounds pretty good on the Headphone, but a caveat: Bragi's press materials told me this might not be the audio profile that will be on retail units. The profile on the model I'm wearing right now is fairly neutral. That's to say, it's sounds like there's less emphasis on the bass and the high midrange frequencies (vocals, melodies, etc.), which are commonly ramped up in consumer headphones.\nAgain, if we're comparing to the Dash, I actually prefer the Dash's audio profile. It feels a little thicker, and has more impact (and a fair bit louder). The Headphone is still a very good listen, and probably more suitable to those who listen to live/acoustic music. My noisy brand of angry dance music just doesn't feel quite as thumping this time around, though.\nThe microphone, on the other hand, is less impressive. I rang a number of friends and family and didn't tell them I was using a hands-free, and nearly everyone asked me where I was calling from in that \"you-sound-different\" kinda way. I recorded a few tests on my MacBook using the mic on the Headphone, and they ranged from poor to inaudible. You'll be able to use these to make calls, but it's not a strong suit.\nIt might seem like there's a lot of things lacking in the Headphone, and to a large degree that's true ... if you compare it to the Dash. Pit the Headphone against most of the competition, and suddenly things look rosier. The general connectivity situation is a great step forward for the category. The audio quality is solid (even if the mic is lacking), and the six or so hours of battery life is pretty decent (though a shame there's no battery in the case).\nAt $149, the price undercuts Earin's lightweight buds by some $50, and is (no doubt deliberate) $10 less than Apple's AirPods, which is perhaps the competition Bragi's really setting its sights on. With a better battery life, decent audio and enough change to buy yourself lunch, the Headphone should appeal to those iPhone 7 owners shopping around for a wireless set. Especially if Bragi can deliver on it's \"November\" ship date and beat Apple to market.",

      "text": "Apple’s Black Friday 2016 deals are live right now, but they’re not very good at all Chris Smith Pin it Share Apple has Black Friday deals for you this year, and they’re finally available in America and other markets — we first got wind of the sale from Apple’s Australia and New Zealand stores . Before you whip out your credit card though, you should know that Apple’s sales won’t get you the best savings on Apple gear this Black Friday. DEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now! You should also know that Apple’s best products aren’t included in Apple’s sale promo. So if you’re looking for a cheaper iPhone 7, 2016 MacBook Pro laptop, or second-generation Apple Watch, Apple.com isn’t the right place to shop. So, what is Apple offering you on Black Friday?

      "text": "\nShould you get the small 38mm or large 42mm Apple Watch? Here's how to choose!\nApple has provided two sizing options for the Apple Watch : 38mm and 42mm. Whether you're getting aluminum, steel, or ceramic, Series 1 or Series 2, Nike+ or Hermès, they all come in those two sizes. Some might consider their personal choice obvious, whether that's based on wrist size, gender, or some other factor. If you're not finding it quite so obvious, however, here are some things to consider when picking the perfect Apple Watch size for you!\nHeight vs. width \nUnlike traditional watches, which measure case size horizontally, Apple is measuring the Apple Watch vertically. The smaller of the two has a height of 38mm (specifically, 38.6mm); the larger, 42mm. When it comes to width, the smaller Apple Watch is 33.3mm wide; the larger, 35.9mm.\nThese differences might not sound like very much — 3-4mm here or there — but 4mm out of 40mm is one tenth of the watch dimensions.\nThe rounded rectangular shape of the Apple Watch makes it hard to compare directly with round watches, but in the traditional watch world, neither of the Apple Watches would be considered overly wide or high. Big watches are typically closer to 48mm.\nSo, even if you think you want to go small, you can still consider both sizes — neither is enormous.\nDisplay size \nThe different case sizes also come with different display sizes. Both are Retina quality displays, which means the pixels are invisible to the naked eye at normal viewing distance. The bigger Apple Watch simply has more of those pixels.\nThe 38mm Apple Watch has a display size of 340x272 pixels. The 42mm Apple Watch has a display size of 390x312 pixels. The interface will fill whatever size display you have, and for many people, it won't make any difference. If you really want more pixels, however, it's something to consider.\nDepth perception \nUnlike the Watch's two height options and two display densities, there's no difference when it comes to the thickness (or thinness) of the two sizes.\nThat's because, unlike traditional mechanical or digital watches, the Apple Watch case has to hold a Retina display, the system-in-a-package (chipset), battery, and sensors. If you're trying to figure out which Apple Watch will best fit under the tight cuffs of your shirt, they're both about the same.\nHers and his \nBecause there are two sizes, and because some of the bands Apple has shown off so far are unique to one size or another, some have tried to simplify the size discussion down to \"hers\" and \"his.\" People come in all shapes and sizes, however, and so do tastes. Some women will want the bigger Apple Watch, and some men, the smaller. Some people with small wrists will want the bigger watch, and vice versa. All this to say — get the size you want.\nBand bias \nSince Apple is, so far, only listing some bands at some sizes, if you have your heart set on a certain band, you may have to be willing to go with the size that matches it. The Apple Watch Sport shows sport bands for both cases; the Apple Watch and Apple Watch Edition, however, currently list size-specific bands.\n38mm-specific bands:\nModern Buckle Hermès Double Buckle Cuff Hermés Double Tour 42mm-specific bands\nLeather Loop Hermès Single Tour Deployment Buckle Price points The 38mm Apple Watch is slightly less expensive than the 42mm Apple Watch. So, if you want to save some money, you can do it if you go for the smaller size.\n38mm:\nApple Watch Series 1: Starts at $269 Apple Watch Series 2: Starts at $369 42mm:\nApple Watch Series 1: Starts at $299 Apple Watch Series 2: Starts at $399 Battery life \nThe 42mm Apple Watch has a slightly bigger battery than the 38mm watch, and the Series 2 has a slightly bigger battery than the Series 1. So, if battery life is important to you — for example, you want to get in multiple workouts a day or you want to go a couple days without charging — you'll not only want to go with Series 2, but with the 42mm.\nWho should get the 38mm Apple Watch? If you have a small wrist and want the Apple Watch to look comfortable on it, if you have a large wrist and want the Apple Watch to look small, or if you just like smaller watches in general, you should get the 38mm Apple Watch.\nWho should get the 42mm Apple Watch? If you have a small wrist and want the Apple Watch to look big, if you have a large wrist and you want the Apple Watch to look as big as possible, if you have vision requirements that benefit from bigger graphics, you want a longer-lasting battery, or if you like bigger watches in general, you should get the 42mm Apple Watch.\nApple Watch \nwatchOS 3 review Apple Watch Series 2 review Apple Watch buyers guide Apple Watch users guide Apple Watch news Apple Watch discussion Buy at Apple ",

      "text": "how rugged is your phone pexels photo More picjumbo.com/Pexels\nThe iPhone 7 may be Apple’s first water-resistant phone, but don’t go dunking it in your pool’s deep end anytime soon — after all, the company cautions that it can only withstand up to a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That got us wondering, just what do manufacturers like Apple mean when they use terms like “water-proof” and “water-resistant”? What constitutes a “rugged” device? And at the end of the day, how many times can you drop your phone in the toilet before it stops functioning?\nMore: The best waterproof smartphone you can buy\nAs it turns out, there are often standards behind terms such as “rugged” and “water-resistant,” and they’re quite strict. So before you buy your next “durable” phone, you may want to understand how to interpret the ratings behind them.\nThe ratings behind a “rugged” product “Rugged” is just a word, a marketing term as meaningless as “summer-proof,” “whatever-proof,” “water resistant,” and “dust proof” — all make for nice bullet points on a gadget’s spec sheet, but aren’t all that descriptive. “Rugged” and “water-resistant” devices can short when they fall into water, shatter when they hit the concrete, and shut down if they lay in the hot sun for too long. But when a phone’s been certified , by contrast, that means a third-party organization has conducted tests to ensure it can survive conditions like hard falls, dusty environments, extreme heat and cold, certain forms of radiation, and deep pools of water.\nPhone, tablet, and PC manufacturers designate the ruggedness of a device with two flavors of standards: the Ingress Protection (IP) Rating, published by a standards body called the International Electrotechnical Commission, and the Military Specification or Military Standard (MIL-STD), which are developed by various arms of the U.S. Military and Department of Defense. When Apple advertises that the iPhone 7 as “water resistant,” what it really means is that it’s achieved some level of certification.\nIngress Protection Rating The Ingress Protection Rating of a device is determined by how well it performs in tests that expose it to dirt, dust, and water. Ratings range from 1 to 6 for dust and dirt, and 1 to 8 for water, where the first and second digit in the rating indicate how well it withstands exposure to foreign particles and liquid, respectively. The maximum rating for solid objects, IP 6, means a device is completely resistant to dust and dirt. A water resistance rating of 8, meanwhile, means it can be submerged in liquid for an indefinite amount of time up to a depth specified by the manufacturer.\nIn order for a smartphone to achieve a rating, it must pass every test leading up to the highest rating achieved. For a smartphone to gain IP68 certification, for example, it must pass dust protection tests through 6 and water protection tests through level 8. Below is a breakdown of the ratings for solid foreign objects.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected No protection against solid objects 1 >50 millimeter Protection against large surfaces like the back of the hand 2 >12.5 millimeter Protection against finger-sized objects 3 >2.5 millimeter Protection against thick wires and like objects 4 >1 millimeter Protection against wires, screws, etc. 5 Dust protected Some protection against dust and complete protection against contact 6 Dust tight Complete protection against dust and contact And here’s a chart for water resistance ratings.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected 1 Dripping water Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water 2 Dripping water when tilted up to 15 degrees Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water when tilted 15 degrees from normal position 3 Spraying water Protection against 5 minutes of spraying water at any angle up to 60 degrees from the vertical 4 Splashing water Protection against 5 minutes of splashing water 5 Water jets Protected against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a 6.3-millimeter nozzel from any direction 6 Powerful water jets Protection against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a powerful nozzle (12.5-millimeter) from any direction 7 Immersion up to 1 meter Protection against 30 minutes of water up to 1 meter of submersion 8 Immersion beyond 1 meter Protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer For an idea of how an IP test is conducted, take a look at this video of a test being conducted on behalf of electronics company Siemens. The resulting rating looks something like this: IP67. That’s the certification the iPhone 7 has received, and it means that the phone’s both completely protected against solid objects and can withstand up to a meter of water for 30 minutes.\nIt isn’t always that simple, though. Some phones have two ratings, such as Sony’s IP55- and IP57-certified Xperia Z, which usually indicates that the device failed water or dust protection at a certain level. In the Xperia Z’s case, water protection level 6.\nMilitary Specifications and Standards Military Specifications and Standards number in the hundreds and certify a product’s ability to handle specific scenarios. For example, there are MIL-STD-810Gs that certify products to handle nuclear radiation exposure, drops onto concrete, rapid temperature changes, and a wide number of other environmental challenges.\nHere’s a partial list:\nTest Method 500.5 Low Pressure (Altitude) Test Method 501.5 High Temperature Test Method 502.5 Low Temperature Test Method 503.5 Temperature Shock Test Method 504.1 Contamination by Fluids Test Method 505.5 Solar Radiation (Sunshine) Test Method 506.5 Rain Test Method 507.5 Humidity Test Method 508.6 Fungus Test Method 509.5 Salt Fog Test Method 510.5 Sand and Dust Test Method 511.5 Explosive Atmosphere Test Method 512.5 Immersion Test Method 513.6 Acceleration Test Method 514.6 Vibration Test Method 515.6 Acoustic Noise Test Method 516.6 Shock Test Method 517.1 Pyroshock Test Method 518.1 Acidic Atmosphere Test Method 519.6 Gunfire Shock Test Method 520.3 Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, and Altitude Test Method 521.3 Icing/Freezing Rain Test Method 522.1 Ballistic Shock Test Method 523.3 Vibro-Acoustic/Temperature Test Method 524 Freeze / Thaw Test Method 525 Time Waveform Replication Test Method 526 Rail Impact. Test Method 526 Rail Impact Test Method 527 Multi-Exciter Test Method 528 Mechanical Vibrations of Shipboard Equipment (Type I – Environmental and Type II – Internally Excited) Perhaps the most common standard for rugged devices is MIL-STD-810G, which is an umbrella designation with a number of durability subcategories — namely protection against drops and falls.\nMore: What do military drop test certifications really mean? We asked the experts\nRead More Military Standards ratings comprise an exhaustive number of certifications. Sadly, though, they aren’t exactly standardized. Manufacturers can conduct an array of different tests and arrive at the same certification. Take the 810G’s “temperature shock” certification, for instance, or a device’s ability to withstand fluctuating temperatures. The temperature range isn’t defined, and neither is the amount of time, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a smartphone maker to claim that its handset is 810G-certified without having to explain what, exactly, that really means.\nHow a real “Active” product should be built Panasonic, known for its durable line of ToughBook and ToughPad products, sees rugged products in an entirely different way than manufacturers like Casio and Apple. As opposed to focusing on an idea like “water resistance” or “dust proofing,” Panasonic’s Director of Product Management Kyp Walls says that shock protection is what makes its products more rugged than the rest.\n“What we say about all of our devices is that they will handle a drop,” Walls told Digital Trends.\nMore: If you’re a clutz who works at a construction site, the Cat S40 might be worth a look\nMany of the popular ToughBook and ToughPad products meet the MIL-STD-810G standard, which certifies the device against a lot of scenarios — including many that you’d likely find yourself in on a regular basis. “MIL-SPEC drop procedures say you will drop [the device] on every edge, corner, side, and face – equaling 26 drops on plywood, concrete and steel” said Walls.\nBut Panasonic isn’t just making rugged products for the sake of being rugged, Walls said. It’s releasing laptops aimed at specific audiences and scenarios. “We are trying to build devices for people who are in scenarios 95 percent of the time … Are there people who need a device who will take a 12 foot drop to concrete? Probably, but we’re building our devices for people who need a 4 to 6 foot drop. In order to design something to be submersible, you have to build it differently.”\nView photos\nthumbnailimage-scale-large More Digital Trends also spoke with Xplore, a manufacturer that focuses exclusively on designing and building rugged devices. It recently launched the RangerX , a rugged Android tablet. Like Panasonic, Xplore also tests its tablets, ensuring that they can survive the 26-point drop test on plywood, steel, and concrete.\nMore: Ten rugged cases to shield your pricey iPhone from dirt, dings, and drops\nXplore’s VP of Marketing Jim Plas gave us some details about why a rugged design matters, noting how “unlike the [Samsung’s] S4 Active, where they took an existing product and added features for water and dust resistance, we start from the core of the device with the mid-frame. Around that, you build the case and screen.” The mid-frame is important as it grounds all the components of the tablet or smartphone, and is what helps not only disperse shock from drops, but also helps resist water from the ground up. “The DNA of the device is rugged to begin with,” he added.\nPlas told us that, in his experience, “making a waterproof device with a user-replaceable battery is possible, but it sure isn’t easy.” He added that not only the battery has to be water-sealed, but also there couldn’t be any ingresses or ports from which water can easily enter.\nMore than IP67 For devices like the iPhone 7, certification goes as far as dust, dirt, and 1 meter of water. If you drop an iPhone 7 onto concrete from four feet up, you may very well kiss your gadget goodbye. Meanwhile, if you drop the RangerX, you’ll be fine, but it won’t fare too well in 1 meter of water. Rugged means a lot of things in the world of electronics, which is why it boils down the standards and ratings.\nPerhaps more importantly, just because a phone is has achieved a certain certification doesn’t mean it’ll hold up to abuse. Manufacturers conduct tests under lab conditions far different than the real-life scenarios you’re likely to find yourself in. In one particularly egregious example, Sony sent out marketing materials that showed the company’s IP68-certified Xperia phones being used underwater … accompanied by a warning not to use them in as depicted. “Remember not to use the device underwater,” the company said. “The IP rating of your device was achieved in laboratory conditions in standby mode, so you should not use the device underwater, such as taking pictures.”\nIt’s vital to find out exactly what ratings your device has before you buy it. Rare is the smartphone that truly does it all — if you see an ad claiming that a device is “rugged” and “water-proof,” you should find out the certifications behind those claims. No device is rugged in every way, so choose your protection based on the biggest dangers in your life.\nThe best waterproof smartphone you can buy How do you decide on a rugged case?

He called the company's marketing \"out of touch.\" \n\"They have manufacturing issues, they have issues in China, they got a stronger dollar that's going to hurt foreign sales,\" Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an independent investment advisor, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\"\"We're very disappointed with management. It's just so disappointing to have nothing, absolutely nothing new.\" \nGerber said Google and Microsoft , who have led the way on smart home devices and virtual reality, are \"taking [Apple]'s lunch.\" But Munster said that Wall Street's view of the stock misses the forest for the trees. This month, Microsoft shares have risen 1 percent, while Google parent Alphabet has fallen 3.7 percent. \n\"At the end of the day, maybe the features weren't as exciting as they have been in the past,\" Munster said. \"The iPhone is a product that people want.\" \nDisclosure: Piper Jaffray makes a market in shares of Apple.

      "text": " Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were slightly higher in early-afternoon trading today, as the tech giant offers gift cards for certain products, including the iPhone, iPads, Apple Watch Series 1, Macs or Apple TV, rather than discounts for Black Friday.\nApple last offered these gift cards back in 2014. It may have brought them back this year because there was some sticker shock when it announced the prices on its new Macbook Pro line, which start at $1,499 for the most basic model, Recode senior retail editor Lauren Goode said on CNBC's \"Squawk Alley\" on Friday morning.\nThese gift cards can help Apple move products off the shelves, particularly as it helps ease consumer concern about having to purchase extra adaptors with the new Macbook Pro.\nThe gift cards will also help encourage customers to come into the stores as they consider buying a product or products that they were previously hesitant about purchasing due to price, Goode said. Then once they buy one product, many think they are more inclined to purchase another Apple product while they're in the store.\nWhile Apple is trying to push products off the shelves, it has still not released its bluetooth headphones called Air Pods that were due out at the end of October. They are to be paired with the iPhone 7, which is the first model missing a headphone jack, Goode noted. The company is \"missing out\" because bluetooth headphones have been on the upward trend even before the new iPhones came out and is a \"hot gadget\" this season.",
