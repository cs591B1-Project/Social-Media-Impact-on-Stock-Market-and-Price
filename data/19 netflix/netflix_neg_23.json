      "text": "Jack Busch   News \nEarlier today, Netflix dropped a blog post announcing that you can now download Netflix content—including movies and TV episodes—and watch it offline. Immediately, an update to the Netflix iOS and Android apps was pushed out that adds the offline playing and download feature. Watching movies offline has been available for Amazon Video for over a year so for those of us who prefer Netflix, this is exciting news today! How does it work? Let’s take a deep dive into the announcement and demo how to get it going. \nHere’s what the Netflix blog said: \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. \nI’m actually traveling today and was about to write up a post on United Airlines in-flight app. But to heck with that—I can watch Netflix in airplane mode now. \nCheck it out on my iPhone. The iOS update is version 9.0.0 released today, Nov. 30, 2016. It’s a 41.1 MB download. \nI had to log back in with this 9.0.0 Netflix update. After that, there was a welcome screen that explained the offline playback feature. It looks like only select titles are available to download, but it seems to include all the Netflix Originals which, honestly, should keep you busy for quite a while. Lady Dynamite, Black Mirror, Narcos , a ton of standup specials from John Mulaney, Louis CK, Kathleen Madigan—it’s all there! \nThere’s an entire Available for Download section you can browse. \nWhen you select a title, a little download icon will show up next to the episodes you can save for offline viewing. \nNote that your settings won’t let you download over cellular data networks by default. You can change this in your Netflix App settings. There’s a whole new Downloads section where you can toggle “Wi-Fi Only” off or on. You can also choose your video quality. I imagine it’ll really add up in the storage space if you download an entire season of Clifford: Puppy Days. The bar at the bottom tells you how much space Netflix is taking up. I have unlimited data with AT&T, so I was happy to start chewing through some bandwidth with some big downloads. \nGo to My Downloads (open the menu from the upper-right) to see your downloaded content. \nTo delete episodes after watching, tap Edit in the top-right. \nSo far, I’m happy to report that Netflix offline viewing works great. I used it on my iPhone without issue. I downloaded everything over a cellular network, and my episodes were ready by the time I got to my gate. More Reading: About Jack Busch",

      "text": "Pin it Share Netflix has finally rolled out a feature subscribers have been requesting for years: The company will now let members worldwide download select TV shows and movies for viewing on Apple and Android devices while disconnected from the internet. The latest versions of the company’s mobile apps include a “download” button on the details page for a film or TV series — although not all titles on the streaming service are currently available to watch offline. The app also includes a new menu item showing what’s available to download. Netflix said it will add more series and movies to download in the future. Original series including “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos,” “House of Cards,” “Stranger Things,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “Master of None” and “The Crown” are available for download starting Wednesday. Other titles available for offline viewing include TV shows “Supernatural,” “The Office,” “The Flash” and “The 100,” and animated movies “Minions” and “Home.” “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post announcing the feature. Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members on iOS and Android apps for more than a year, while YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. Netflix’s new download feature is included in all plans and available for Android and iOS phones and tablets. To download titles, users will need iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later as well as the latest update of Netflix’s app. Netflix execs had previously raised the prospect of allowing downloads for offline viewing, but they had suggested the company would first launch the feature in countries with constrained bandwidth infrastructure.

      "text": "This is not a drill! Netflix has officially launched an update that allows users to download movies and shows from their popular streaming service to watch while offline. No more worrying about your WiFi signal, no more paying for movies on airplanes, and, most importantly, no more buffering!\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” read the statement on the Netflix website .\nWhile this news has likely rocked you to your core, don’t get too excited. While you will be able to download every Netflix original series along with a huge selection of other popular shows and movies, not everything on the popular streaming site will be available to download. Notable absences include Friends, New Girl, and anything created by Disney. However, Netflix is working to lock down the rights to these shows, so keep your fingers crossed.\n“Netflix is working with lots of partners globally to get downloading rights for the bulk of the content on our service,” said Marlee Tart, a Netflix spokeswoman, in an email to WIRED . “This is an ongoing effort as we know consumers want this capability and we are working to provide it.”\nIn true Netflix fashion, they have made downloading your favorite shows and movies as simple as you can imagine. Whether you’re on your smartphone, your tablet, or your computer, just click the tiny download button you’ve become all too familiar with and you’ll be on your way to offline viewing in no time.\n\nThe move comes at the perfect time for the streaming company and customers alike. Not only with this huge move bolster their fourth quarter numbers, it will attract the few straggler that have held out. And with a month until the holiday season peaks, customers will have plenty of time to make room of their devices to lock down full seasons of their favorite shows.\nPhoto: Flickr / Shardayyy \n",

Advertisement \nEddy Wu, the company's director of product innovation, announced Wednesday that the latest versions of iOS and Android applications for phones and tablets will come with a download feature for select titles.

You can now download episodes and movies to watch while offline. \nAnd you thought Netflix and chill was dead. Wrong. It’s just been reignited. Think about the endless possibilities: \nN&C on a park bench? Sure. N&C in the back of a car? 100 percent. You can even take it to the mile-high club now. What a time to be alive. Shutterstock So how does it work? \nVery easily. All you have to do is find the download button next to an episode of your choice and, you know, download… Netflix \nThe awesome news was dropped by the streaming company in a blog post . Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, said, \nNetflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost. \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. \nJust click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. Giphy \nI can’t seem to find the download icon on my Netflix account for now (probably need to update it), but the company said many shows are available to view offline as of today. \nThese include “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos” and “The Crown.” \nThe new feature will be rolled out to all plans and is available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. \nWOOP. Happy early Christmas present to me, from Netflix. You’re too good to us, guys, really. \nBetween this and Spotify, you can revel in the fact you probably won’t ever have to speak to people again. \n ",

Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 \n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \nNetflix now allows subscribers to download films and episodes of their favorite shows for later viewing. Because the streaming rabbit hole wasn’t addictive enough.\nThe service announced on its company blog today that, in addition to its usual streaming options, you can already (right now!) download “many of your favorite streaming series and movies” with “more on the way.” This should make things a lot easier for people who, say, wanna continue their show binges while traveling. If you’re in a subway, on a plane, or a passenger in a car traveling through areas with a questionable network, as long as you’ve planned and remember to download your faves ahead of time, you’ll be good to go!\n\nAll you have to do is make sure you have the most updated version of the Netflix app on your various portable devices. Then, look for the icon in the photo above and get to downloading!\nThis is available on the app for both iOS and Android, and it’s available across plans (so this isn’t something you’ll have to end up paying more money for). And if you’re worried about storage space, there are options. As reported by The Verge , “there are two options for quality: Standard and Higher. “Standard quality is a slightly lower video resolution that requires less storage space and takes less time to download. Higher quality is a higher video resolution that requires more storage space and takes more time to download.” Netflix doesn’t actually spell out what that higher resolution is.”\nIt’s a happy day for Netflix users, who’ve been waiting for this option for a while (and who’ve been watching as other services, like Amazon, have already been doing this). Now, all your favorite Netflix originals like Stranger Things, Orange Is the New Black , and all the Marvel shows will be available whenever you want them!\n(images via Netflix)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "You can now download Netflix shows for Offline viewing   5:29 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nNetflix users have been requesting an offline viewing feature for quite some time now and after plenty of consideration, the streaming service has finally made it happen. Starting from today, Netflix will be getting an offline viewing mode, allowing subscribers to download certain shows and movies to watch later when there is no access to the internet. \nThe new offline mode is only available for Android and iOS devices through the Netflix app and while subscribers do need to pay extra for things like Ultra-HD playback, offline viewing will be a free addition to all subscription tiers. \nOffline playback isn’t available for all titles but this is to be expected as most companies are notoriously strict when it comes to the rights it gives each service provider for specific movies and TV shows. That said, if you are a fan of Netflix’s original content, all of that will be available for offline viewing. \nNetflix has committed to adding additional shows and movies to its offline viewing lineup over time but it all depends on whether or not the company can secure the rights or not. \nKitGuru Says: While you won’t be able to watch the entire Netflix library in offline mode, you do get access to some pretty good shows and movies. As someone who spends quite a bit of time sat on the train going from A to B, I can see myself making good use of this feature, though I must admit I am quite surprised Netflix eventually gave in to the idea of offline viewing after years of shutting it down.",

Now that edge has been dulled, as Netflix has just added that functionality to its iOS and Android app. \nUsers will find a new download button on the details page for a film or TV series, that will download the video to your smartphone or tablet. \nMORE: How to watch 4K video online and on TV \nThis doesn't extend to all Netflix content, however. It appears to focus on (but is not exclusive to) Netflix Original Series programes such as Stranger Things or The Crown. \nTo get this option on your device, you'll need to be running iOS 8.0 or later for Apple products, Android 4.4.2 or later for Android ones. \nThere are two options of video quality - 'Standard' and 'High' - although Netflix hasn't specified the resolution difference between the two.

      "text": "Netflix and Streaming Video Are Replacing Hotel Pay-Per-View Entertainment \nDeanna Ting, Skift - Nov 30, 2016 7:30 am \nMarriott is piloting a new casting technology called Connect My Device that will allow guests to \"cast\" their favorite streaming content directly onto their in-room TVs. Marriott International Photo: Marriott International Share Tweet Post Send Skift Take \nIf the advent of artificial-intelligence-driven smart speakers like Google Home and Amazon Echo is any indication, the Internet of Things is that much closer to becoming a reality, even when we check into our hotel rooms. — Deanna Ting \nIt might be crazy to think of this — especially at a time when some of us still agonize over the super-slow speed with which it takes to download a simple PDF in some hotel rooms — but we’re calling it: In just a few years’ time, it’s highly likely that the Internet of Things (IoT) will be coming to a hotel room near you. \nWhat does that mean, exactly? It means that the only “smart” product in your hotel room won’t be limited to your phone anymore. It means that your TV, the temperature, the lighting, the curtains, will all be connected via the Internet, and controlled by the guest. \nRobert Cole, the founder of RockCheetah , a hotel marketing strategy and travel technology consulting firm, envisions a future where guests won’t even have to log in to access Wi-Fi. \n“You can walk into a hotel and be on your mobile device, and whether you have a reservation or not, you can automatically log into the high-speed guest network,” he said. “If you have a reservation, the hotel recognizes you’re there and accessing the Wi-Fi or using Bluetooth smart beacons. You should be able to go up to your room and use your phone to get in and as soon as you enter, your Netflix will show up. Everything should happen seamlessly. Your apps and services will help you with your journey.” \nWe’re not there just yet, and there are still some obvious challenges for the IoT to work itself out, especially when it comes to cybersecurity . But there could be a day in the not-so-distant future when voice-activated rooms, like the ones being piloted by Aloft, will become the norm. \nAnd even more likely? That we’ll all be able to watch the latest season of Netflix’s House of Cards or Amazon’s Transparent from our hotel rooms. \nHere’s where we currently stand when it comes to in-room technology and entertainment. Casting Call \nMore hotels are enabling guests to be able to watch streaming channels like Netflix and Hulu from their hotel room TVs, and exploring casting technology solutions to be able to do so. \nIn June 2015, Marriott became the first hotel chain to allow its guests to watch Netflix from their hotel room televisions . Working with hospitality technology provider Enseo (which has a partnership with Netflix), Marriott was able to allow guests to sign into their own Netflix accounts on their in-room TVs and watch their favorite shows, in addition to accessing other services such as Hulu and Pandora. Marriott expects to have 1,000 contracts for this signed by the end of 2017. \nScott Hansen, Marriott International director of guest technology, said that Marriott realized “the video-on-demand model wasn’t sustainable anymore. People just weren’t buying at the pace they were. You can’t upgrade the infrastructure with ties to a video-on-demand operator. We had to go in a new direction. Guest habits have changed. They want more over- the-top content and less linear programming.” \nThe solution, Hansen said, was to provide guests with access to everything “we take for granted in our own living rooms” and, since then, it’s been a “tremendous success.” \nEnseo, the tech provider which Marriott worked with to bring Netflix and other streaming channels to hotel guest rooms, said that Netflix is consistently among the top three most watched channels among properties that use its technology. It accounted for 11 percent of total viewership time and was the No. 1 watched channel in July 2016. In July 2015, it was the No. 2 most watched channel and accounted for 7 percent of total viewership time. \nMarriott’s system for accessing channels like Netflix is simple enough: Guests simply log into their respective accounts on the TV screen. Typing in every email address and password on the TV, however, isn’t always the most seamless. \n“In a hotel room obviously typing in your credentials with a remote control is tedious,” Hansen said. “Doing it from your mobile phone is easier.” This is why other hotels, Marriott included, are exploring more options that enable guests to simply cast their entertainment preferences directly onto their TV screens. \nHansen said Marriott is currently in the process of debuting Connect My Device, which is based on Google Chromecast protocol and hardware. “We’ve patented a solution that allows for very simple pairing of a guest’s device to the in-room TV,” he said. “It’s proprietary software we’ve developed that works with Chromecast products in guest rooms. Guests enter a simple code and it pairs their mobile device to the TV and isolates it to that room. It pairs it down to just the in-room one.” \nWhen Skift spoke with Hansen in October, he said Marriott was testing this new technology in 6 hotels and that several continents have already made this a brand standard for future Marriott properties. \nPrior to its acquisition by Marriott, Starwood’s Aloft Hotels were also piloting a somewhat similar system as well, called RoomCast . Sarah Downing, vice president of global guest initiatives and innovation for Aloft Hotels, told Skift that the RoomCast pilot at the Aloft hotel in New Orleans was a continuing process and that by November, the entire property will have the technology in every guest room. \nWyndham’s Wingate by Wyndham brand is also piloting a casting service, working with Sonicast, which is powered by Google Chromecast. Lisa Checchio, VP of brand marketing and insights for Wyndham Hotel Group , told Skift that a pilot was launched in September at a property located outside of Chicago that is password-protected and secure. \n“You can fully cast content from thousands of different apps without having to enter your personal credentials, without having to enter it into the personal TV, and it’s automatically disconnected when you leave,” she explained. \nShe added that this new technology is easy for hotel owners to implement as well because it “leverages existing infrastructure — wired or wireless,” and that nearly 50 percent of the portfolio of Wingate owners wants to install the technology into their properties. The Hotel TV Channel Evolves \nWhile we, like most people, dread turning on the TV and having that default hotel channel pop up, many hotel companies are trying to update the content on those channels into something guests will actually want to watch. \nWyndham, for example, launched Wyndham Rewards TV earlier this summer with a series called, “Have Points, Will Travel.” It follows a couple who was given a million Wyndham Rewards points to travel from Northern to Southern California on points alone. \n“It’s sort of like Modern Family meets the Amazing Race,” Checchio explained. “There is so much you can do with in-room content that isn’t just about the properties themselves. Guests want to be entertained.” \nFor Wyndham’s Hawthorn Suites brand, Checchio said Wyndham is thinking of, perhaps, showcasing “mini cooking demos” through the hotel TV channel, in conjunction with the brand’s new Homemade at Hawthorn initiative. For this program, Wyndham partnered with two regional chefs who created an e-cookbook for guests staying at Hawthorn Suites. \nIn January, Marriott’s Autograph Collection will debut an independent film channel. Working with FilmBuff, the channel will broadcast more than 1,500 different titles — films, documentaries, shorts, TV shows, and webisodes — that focus on art, design, food and music. \nEarlier this year, Marriott Hotels also announced that it would include exclusive TED content in its in-room entertainment for guests. And Marriott International’s own content studio continues to produce short films like the Two Bellmen series . Infrastructure Is Getting Better \nAll of these innovations, such as casting, are indeed a step forward in terms of being able to better personalize the in-room guest experience. But they’re often not possible for hotels to implement unless they have the tech infrastructure necessary to deliver these services. \nThat’s why a number of hotel brands and individual properties are making major investments in technology infrastructure first, before they start testing out casting or voice-activated rooms, for example. \nInterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) is doing so on a massive scale. The IHG Connect Internet initiative, which began last year, will impact 1,500 hotels in the Americas by the end of 2016 and, eventually, all of IHG’s more than 5,000 hotels worldwide, bringing faster, more reliable, and more seamless Internet access to guests. \n“This is a foundational platform for the future of IHG,” Jeff Eckard, VP of technology for the Americas at IHG told Skift. The reason IHG is investing so heavily in this is because the number of devices in use worldwide is expected to increase to 33 billion by 2020, and each person is estimated to have approximately 4.3 connected device by 2020 as well. \nIHG Connect involves the placement of multiple wireless access points throughout each hotel that increase bandwidth by at least four times, creating “dedicated pipes that can grab as much connectivity that’s needed so hotel owners don’t have to worry about how much bandwidth they’ve signed up for, and hotel guests won’t become frustrated,” Eckard explained. Those wireless points also contain built-in beacons and all are connected to a cloud-based tech platform that allows IHG to monitor each access point and implement changes that much more easily. Guests will log in once, and then have access their entire stay. \nIn a similar fashion, Samsung is working with hotels to deliver a similar type of technology and Internet speed for hotel guests with its Samsung Hospitality Wall Plate access point. Earlier this year, the company partnered with New York’s Le Parker Meridien hotel to test the service in the hotel, and the results, said John Yu, director of management systems for Le Parker Meridien, were a success. \n“At any given time, we have 800 to 1,400 devices running on our network,” Yu said. “But during our peak evening hours, we typically have over 2,000 devices connected to the network simultaneously.” By placing these access points throughout the hotel, however, Yu said, “We used to have difficulty providing a quality network experience when we hosted gaming or movie companies because of their VPN, static IP, speed and coverage needs. But our new access points are robust enough to take care of these issues.” \nHaving all of these access points in place, IHG’s Eckard said, will help IHG further strengthen its loyalty program (all loyalty members get access to free Wi-Fi) and that because the system auto-recognizes guests, it will automatically be able to connect them to Wi-Fi more easily. With the beacons, he said, “We can turn on location-based services, and start to recognize and connect and personalize the experience for our guests.” \nBeacon-based technology is something being piloted by Hilton and Marriott, enabling both companies to know exactly where their guests are on property and sending them targeted marketing messages or offering them customized information. \nEckard added, “This is just the beginning. This is the beginning of our journey. IHG connect is laying down the foundation to help us personalize the guest experience and deliver faster performance. Those latest devices are all engineered to go faster and faster, and we’re enabling those devices to go as fast as they can.” Smart Hotel Rooms \nHaving that kind of an infrastructure in terms of connectivity lays the groundwork for what’s to come: smart hotel rooms, or even voice-activated guest rooms. \n“Voice-activated rooms have been a home run for us,” said Aloft Hotels’ Downing. “We’ve gotten a ton of feedback from our guests and operators as well. They’re asking us: ‘How do we add in-room delivery on the app so guests can order meals that come to their room? How can we add electronic drapes there when the sun is rising, or come up when sun is setting? It’s all about putting control in the guest’s hands.” \nSome critics have said the Aloft pilot with Siri, while novel and tech-forward, can be a bit cumbersome because of the instructions involved and that some guests would rather just use the provided in-room iPad to adjust things in the room instead of using their voice. \nTo that point, Downing said, “That’s why piloting in the space is so important. You’re listening to the guest to tell you what’s too much versus what they want more of. A person not comfortable about the temp can just tell Siri without getting out of bed. We’re also looking at the voice-activation and making it acceptable for those who aren’t as comfortable with being future forward. If you don’t want to speak to Siri you just pick up the iPad and you can use it just as you would with your own personal devices.” \nWhile many agree that voice-activated mechanisms like search by voice will be crucial going forward, including the founders of Expedia and Priceline , not everyone is so convinced it’s worth the return on investment when it comes to hotels. \n“The future of the guest room will be voice activation,” said Marriott’s Hansen. “Amazon Echo and Apple’s Siri are consumer versions of this technology. I have all that in my own home. That is the future. Whether we use that existing tech or some other voice-activated mechanism has yet to be determined. The real brick in the road is trying to get the Internet of Things upgraded to the net-connected appropriate part of the network. It’s very expensive to retrofit everything in a hotel.”  ",

      "text": " Google+\nRyan Anson/AFP/Getty Images\nUsers can now download Netflix programming and watch it later, while offline.\nBy Lucas Shaw Bloomberg November 30, 2016\nNetflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers.\nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world’s largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as “The Crown” and “Orange is the New Black” at first, according to a statement Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com Inc. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa.\nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, in a web post.",

      "text": "MORE >> \nAmid negative reviews from critics and fans alike about Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival, Lauren Graham and the rest of her co-stars are defending the show and addressing why some of the characters came off as “awful” and “selfish” in the new ending. \nDuring a panel discussion hosted by SAG-AFTRA in New York City on Tuesday night (Nov. 29, 2016), Graham was joined by Alexis Bledel , Kelly Bishop and Scott Patterson to discuss the much talked-about series. When moderator Gazelle Emami mentions Paul ( Jack Carpenter ), the boyfriend that Rory (Bledel) keeps forgetting to break up with over the course of a year, Graham rolled her eyes and explained that it was all in jest. \n“I know what you mean, but the show has a sense of humor, and that’s its sense of humor. And I think maybe [the revival] feels a little different,” she said. “Rory’s not in high school anymore, so yes, as grown women, constantly forgetting [about Paul], I just thought it was a funny runner.” \n“To me it was more of a metaphor for, ‘This isn’t the right guy,’ and this is how they communicate about it,” she continued. “And does it go 10 steps too far? I don’t know, but it was 90 minutes. We had a lot of time to fill!” 16 Photos » \nPatterson, who plays Lorelai’s live-in boyfriend Luke, noted, “Paul was a sacrificial lamb, and he knew it! The audience knew it.” \nThough Rory’s questionable choices in the romance department — particularly sleeping with an engaged man and having a one night stand with stranger dressed as a Wookiee — raised a lot of eyebrows, Bledel believed it was a refreshing change of pace to see her ambition-driven character struggle with the adult world as a single 30-something. \n“I really wanted her to have some great rewards, or enjoyed quite an interesting life from all her hard work. I wanted her to be on top of the world,” Bledel said. “So to learn that we were picking up with her sort of scrambling a bit and trying to find her footing, I don’t know. I think I wanted to imagine that she got there after having some success and a lot of personal triumphs. I just had to imagine that for her.” 10 Photos » \n“I think I’m always trying to understand where Rory’s coming from in the choices she makes in her romantic life, because she’s so together and so successful in everything she does, really, until these episodes start,” she shared. “But she’s just so hardworking, and I think it’s an interesting part of her character, but one that I’ve always struggled to understand — she always kind of picks people who are very different from one another and who challenge her, fortunately, but who don’t necessarily bring out the best in her.” \nIn regards to that major news Rory drops in finale, Bledel added, “I think Amy [ Sherman-Palladino ] just didn’t want her life to be wrapped up with a bow by the end of these stories, at least, because she’s so young.” \nWatch the full discussion — below.",

      "text": "share Netflix Netflix announced today that select shows and movies on the streaming service are now available to download through the service’s mobile apps for offline viewing. The new feature is included on all of Netflix’s streaming plans, though iOS and Android phones and tablets, right now. The service released this video to introduce downloads: Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” a subsequent Netflix press release explained. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” Only the most up-to-date version of the Netflix app would have the feature, Netflix cautioned. Users who cannot see the download button are advised to update their app . Netflix’s help page for downloading has more useful tidbits, such as the assurance that downloading and streaming consume similar amounts of data — and that users can chose one of two different levels of video quality to download. “Standard” quality is slightly lower resolution than “Higher” quality, but takes less time to download and requires less storage space on the mobile device. At the moment, it appears that all Netflix Originals content — including Stranger Things , and Orange is the New Black — are available for offline viewing, as well as a somewhat eclectic smattering of other shows and films. Things you can download offline on Netflix: Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. Star Trek TV seasons. Alfred Hitchcock Presents. — Scott Stein (@jetscott) November 30, 2016 Notably absent are Netflix’s collaborations with Marvel Studios; Daredevil , Jessica Jones and Luke Cage . Star Wars: The Clone Wars and Star Wars: Rebels are also unavailable for download, indicating that this might be a Disney-wide refusal of the feature. But even given that restriction, this is undoubtably good news for a lot of travelers this holiday season. More From Polygon",

      "text": "By James Walker 48 mins ago in Technology Netflix now allows you to download your favourite shows for offline viewing when the internet isn't available. The feature has long been requested by users who want to watch Netflix while on the go. A large portion of Netflix's library is available. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8 — Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 The company announced the launch of offline playback in a tweet today. It's available in the latest version of the Netflix app on Android and iOS. When you're looking at a show that's available offline, a new download icon will appear to let you save it to your device. The first time it's displayed, a small message will introduce you to offline playback. Two quality options are available, Standard and Higher. Selecting Higher will download the best possible quality video, at the expense of storage space and download time. Standard uses a slightly lower resolution that has a smaller file size. It's ideal if you've got limited storage available or want to save a lot of content. Netflix said it's enabling offline playback for \"your favorite stories.\" At launch, a range of Netflix's own shows, including Stranger Things , The Crown and Orange is the New Black is available. There's also a selection of other content from a range of genres. The Verge reports that Breaking Bad , Mad Men , Boyhood and Hot Fuzz are available, alongside movies like Paddington and Minions. \"Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,\" said Netflix . The addition of offline playback marks a change in Netflix's approach to streaming options on its service. It had previously said it was unlikely to offer downloads, partly due to licensing reasons on some content. Enabling playback without an internet connection makes the company's library more accessible though allows people to watch Netflix wherever they are. The company has decided that expanding its reach should be favoured over promoting streaming. The launch will have a significant impact in regions which have slow or unreliable internet connections. When bandwidth is limited or drop-outs common, streaming video can be arduous and very low quality. Offline playback avoids these issues, allowing you to download content ahead of time and then watch it in high resolution without any hitches. Now it's arrived, Netflix has made the feature as widely available on mobile as possible. Downloads are offered on all of its subscription plans, even to low-paying customers. It could have reserved the feature for the premium tiers, promoting it as a perk for subscribers willing to spend more. Offline playback is available in Netflix's mobile app on Android and iOS from today. There's currently no word on when or if the feature will come to desktop devices. Smartphones are more likely to experience unreliable networks than PCs and laptops but downloads could still be useful in regions with slow connections.",

      "text": "Netflix finally, finally lets you download movies and TV shows for offline viewing.\nIt's really catch-up for Netflix, to be honest. Amazon Instant Video has had downloading and offline viewing for over a year now. Still, better late than never.\nSEE ALSO: Netflix finally gives us the feature we've been waiting for\nThe only thing you'll need to do to start downloading videos for offline watching is update the Netflix app for iOS 8 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later.\nI took the new feature for a spin on an iPhone 7 and Google Pixel XL to see if it's any good.\nTo start, downloading content is really easy. There's a new \"Available for Download\" section in the navigation menu. Click it and you'll be brought to a page of content.\nNetflix's blog post says there's \"plenty of content\" available for download, including Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown .\"\nMy own check confirms there's a good amount of original Netflix series available, but not a whole lot of movies. And yes, Master of None and Stranger Things are available for download.\nImage: SCREENSHOT: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE\nImage: SCREENSHOT: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE\nThe \"Available for Download\" section makes it easy to find content at a glance, but the search feature is almost entirely useless. You'd think tapping the search icon while in \"Available for Download\" would only bring up results for videos that are downloadable, but no, it searches all of Netflix, which makes it more difficult to see what is and isn't available for offline. And, of course, not everything that is downloadable is presented in thumbnail form on the \"Available for Download\" screen.\nDownloadable videos have a \"↓\" next to them. Tap it and the video will save to the Netflix app, pending your iOS or Android device's available storage.\nThere doesn't appear to be any limit to how many videos you can download. Well, any reasonable amount of videos, at least. I had no problem downloading the entire seasons of Master of None, The Crown, Stranger Things, Orange is The New Black (season 2) and the movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi to my 256GB iPhone 7; a total of 41 episodes and one movie. And I could easily add more.\nDownloading EVERYTHING.\nImage: SCREENSHOT: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE\nDownloaded videos have a little phone icon with a check inside next to them.\nImage: SCREENSHOT: RAYMOND WONG/MASHABLE\nVideos appear to be reasonably compressed and optimized for storage. Of course, file sizes will vary, but these are some I was able to collect, to give you an idea:\n30-minute episode of Master of None : 97.7MB-159MB .\n1-hour episode of The Crown : 202.7MB-280.4MB .\n1 hour 22 min movie Jiro Dreams of Sushi : 672.4MB\n2 hour 9 min movie The Sting: 585.1MB\nThese file sizes are on par with what you'd get if you ripped a movie or TV show to DVD (480p) quality. Which is the type of video quality you can expect from the default \"Standard\" quality the app downloads at. There's a \"Higher\" quality setting in the settings, but I couldn't get videos to download in this setting; they just stayed queued up, even though I was on a fast Wi-Fi connection at work. For what it's worth, the \"Higher\" quality setting will definitely use more storage, according to the app.\nNo more waiting for videos to buffer!\nVideos look good. Not crispy-sharp or anything, but they look good enough on a phone screen. And offline viewing is pretty cool. I can't wait to download Netflix shows and watch them on my train commute where the LTE connection always cuts in and out. No more waiting for videos to buffer!\nOne thing to note is that you'll only be able to download videos to one device per account. When I tried to download the videos to my Pixel XL, the app threw up this message:\nImage: screenshot: raymond wong/mashable\nI've got the two-screen + HD ($9.99/month) plan, which is good for streaming to two screens simultaneously, but not for downloading to two screens, apparently. The only way to enable downloads for another device on your account is to delete them off another; in my case, deleting all videos from my iPhone 7 granted access for downloading videos to my Pixel XL.\nOn the plus side, Netflix wisely included an easy way to bulk-delete all downloaded videos by tapping the \"Edit\" button within the \"My Downloads\" page, like so:\nImage: screenshot: raymond wong/mashable\nNetflix downloads works as advertised. I'd like to see more movies and a search just for downloadable videos, but even so, for a launch, pretty darn solid.\nBinging is now even better.\nBONUS: This is what happens when you binge-watch Black Mirror",

(Photo: AP) \nLet's face it, if you could, you'd watch Netflix all the time. But you don't want to eat up all your data -- or worse yet, be stranded someplace like an airplane, with no internet access at all. The horror. \nNetflix has heard your plaintive cries and offers a solution . The company announced today that you are now able to download select shows and watch offline anytime. \nAt the gym? Netflix. \nWhile camping? Netflix. \nThe possibilities are endless. \nThe download option is currently available on both iOS and Android tablet and phones. Not all titles are available yet, and Netflix is of course prioritizing its original content (think \"The Crown,\" \"Orange is the New Black,\" etc.) over other shows. But they promise more titles for download are on the way. \nUpdate your app, look for this little downward pointing arrow next to shows and go nuts. \nSee that arrow? That's your key to Netflix anywhere. (Photo: Via Netflix) \nAllison Carter is Facebook editor at IndyStar and will definitely use this to finally watch \"The Crown.\" Follow her on Twitter @AllisonLCarter . 53 CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://indy.st/2gJPUQq More Stories",

      "text": "NASHVILLE, Tenn. ( WFLA ) —Netflix subscribers can now download movies and TV shows to watch anytime and anywhere – with no Internet connection.\nNetflix said in a blog post Tuesday night, “Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, ‘Orange is The New Black,’ ‘Narcos’ and ‘The Crown’ are available for download today.”\nNetflix isn’t the first streaming tycoon to introduce a downloading feature, though.\nAmazon released a similar program to the Prime video streaming over a year ago.\nNetflix hasn’t discussed the quantity of files you can download yet, but their help page does say there are two different quality standards for downloads.\nThe company also warns the higher quality video will take longer to download and use up more space on your device.\n ",

      "text": "NEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button.\nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go.\nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content.\nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title.\nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.”",

The world’s largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as “The Crown” and “Orange is the New Black” at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com Inc. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. Related Articles November 18, 2016 The “Gilmore Girls” revival is far from perfect, but — luckily for Netflix — fans won’t care \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, in a web post.

When online, you can hit a new download button next to, for example, an episode of a show you’re watching so you can watch it later without an internet connection.\nYou don’t need an extra plan to use it. Offline downloads will be available to all plans and on Android and iOS devices. Customers can update their app now and as long as they’re on iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later, they can begin downloading.\nEddy Wu, Director of Product Innovation, wrote in a company blog post that a few titles are already available for download, including Netflix originals Orange is the New Black , Narcos , and The Crown , and popular series like Supernatural and The Flash , and more will be on the way soon. The app update includes a new menu that shows what’s available for download.\nBasically, Netflix has made it super easy to continue binge watching whatever the latest trending show is even when you’re, for example, on a plane for six hours and don’t want to pay for pricey WiFi.\n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Wong wrote.\nWatch the official announcement video below.\nAirplane mode.

      "text": "Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button.\nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go.\nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content.\nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title.\nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.”\n37.090240 -95.712891 ",

That said, Netflix &apos;s announcement Wednesday that they would finally be offering downloads is just enough to get me (briefly) stoked on life:\nAirplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8\n— Netflix US (@netflix) November 30, 2016 \"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we&apos;ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, Netflix&apos;s director of product innovation, said in a press release. \"Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.\"\nRelated All the Netflix New Releases for December Netflix Projected to Become Officially Bigger Than Cable by Year's End Netflix Announces Not One, Not Two, But THREE Dave Chappelle Comedy Specials But what&apos;s the catch? There&apos;s gotta be a catch, right? Well, there is. Kinda . The download option isn&apos;t available for all movies and TV shows just yet, though Netflix confirmed Wednesday that original series like Orange Is the New Black and Narcos were made immediately available for phone and tablet users. Additional titles are thankfully \"on the way,\" so don&apos;t sweat it.\nRumors about Netflix finally taking the download plunge hit their peak over the summer, with Light Reading reporting in June that the move was an \"open secret\" among industry experts and was expected by the end of the year. Good call, Light Reading . Good call.\nHow&apos;s the future looking, cable providers?\nTags: News , Videos , Apps , Movies , Netflix , TV , TV Shows , Netflix Streaming , binge-watching",

      "text": "  Netflix Begins to Allow Offline Binge-Watching Published on November 30, 2016 . To promote its new 'Gilmore Girls' revival, Netflix made a 'binge candle' with a different scent for each episode. Credit: Netflix via Netflix US & Canada via YouTube Most Popular \nNetflix is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers. \nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world's largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as \"The Crown\" and \"Orange is the New Black\" at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,\" said Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, in a web post. \n-- Bloomberg News",

      "text": "In this 2014 file photo, a person displays Netflix on a tablet in North Andover, Mass. (Elise Amendola / Associated Press)   9:55 A.M. Netflix unveils download feature for offline binge-watching By Lucas Shaw Bloomberg Twitter \nNetflix Inc. is making some TV shows and movies available for download to watch offline, providing its users a feature that has become a must-have for binge-watchers. \nMany fans have requested to watch Netflix content without an internet connection, especially those in emerging markets with limited internet access. The world’s largest online TV network will roll out the feature on phones and tablets for all subscribers, but only for select shows such as “The Crown” and “Orange is the New Black” at first, according to a statement Wednesday. \nNetflix has been signaling it would add a downloading option in recent months, as a way to continue increasing its subscriber base and match video-streaming Amazon.com. Offline viewing will make Netflix shows more accessible to customers around the world, particularly in developing markets in Asia and Africa. \nNetflix has 86.7 million customers worldwide, 47.5 million of whom live in the U.S. The company now relies on international markets for most of its growth, and earlier this year expanded its footprint to the entire world, save for China, Syria, North Korea and Crimea. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their ‘Stranger Things’ binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” said Eddy Wu, Netflix’s director of product innovation, in a web post.   9:55 a.m.",

Photo: PA \nNetflix is allowing users to download TV shows and films to watch offline for the first time. \nThe new feature, which was released on Wednesday, lets people playback videos on their devices without needing any internet connection. \nThose with a Netflix app will now be able to click on a \"download and watch later\" icon which will temporarily store their favourite shows on their phones or tablets. \nEddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation, said \"while many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited.\" Netflix Credit: PA \nOther video streaming services, such as Amazon and Sky, already run subscription-based downloads. However, Netflix's new feature comes with no extra cost as they aim to stay ahead of their rivals. Facts and figures Netflix has an estimated 80 million subscribers. Every subscriber pays £5.99 per month to access the content. In 2015, more than 40 billion hours of video were streamed. Netflix began 15 years ago as a DVD subscription service.

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch during a flight, when traveling by car, or for any other time when there is limited or no access to the internet. \nThe download option was announced Wednesday and a number of shows and movies were made instantly available, including “Breaking Bad,””Narcos” and “Spotlight.” \nNetflix Inc., based in Los Gatos, California, says more downloadable content is coming at no additional charge for users. \nThere has been a push by subscribers to get access to Netflix shows offline. \nAmazon.com Inc., which runs a rival video streaming service, has allowed users to download select shows and movies for about a year.",

Traveling with a kid during the holidays, handing them your device of choice praying it will distract the little ticking time bomb long enough to make it through the flight, and realizing none of the content he likes is accessible offline. \nSh* . \nYou’re surely in for a couple hours of complaining, right? Not anymore! Netflix just introduced offline streaming. You can now download movies, save them to your device, and watch them even when you have no wi-fi signal at all. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” says the announcement released today . “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nDownload now to watch offline later? Thanks, don’t mind if we do. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. To use it, all you need to do is update your Netflix app to the most recent version and get your download on. \nHallelujah. It’s a Christmas miracle.",

      "text": "  \nNetflix announced on Wednesday that its customers with Android and iOS smartphones can now download movies and TV shows for offline viewing. There’s a strange selection of content that’s supported right now, including some original Netflix TV shows and movies in addition to other content. Storing the shows and movies that are available for offline viewing is easy, though. \nHere’s how: Update to the latest version of Netflix in the iTunes or Google Play app store. It needs to be a version that was launched on or after November 30, 2016. Open Netflix on the device you wish to store content on. Tap the menu button on the top-left side of the Netflix application. Tap “Available for Download” in the list on the left side of the screen. If it’s a movie or TV show, look for the download button. It’s a small arrow facing down to a flat line. Tap that. \nOnce you have movies and TV shows downloaded, you’ll be able to access and stream them even when you don’t have a connection. That’s pretty easy to do as well. Here’s how: Open Netflix Tap the menu button Tap “My Downloads.” It’s the second option down under “Notifications” on the left side of the display/ Tap play \nIf you want to delete movies and TV shows that are stored offline, that’s easy to do as well. Here’s how: Open Netflix Tap “My Downloads.” Tap “edit” on the top-right of the screen. Tap the red X next to the shows and movies you want to remove from your device. If you want to delete everything at once, you can go to menu, app settings “delete all downloads.” \nFinally, if you want to store high quality movie and TV downloads, you can do so in settings. Here’s how: Open Netflix Tap “App settings” at the very bottom of the list Select “Video quality” Change from “Standard” to “Higher.” Note that this uses more of your phone’s storage. \nThat’s it! You now know how to find downloadable Netflix content, delete specific content, delete all offline Netflix content and even change the quality of the downloads from standard to high. We hope this helps! \nTopics # Netflix # Netflix Todd Haselton \nTodd Haselton has been writing professionally since 2006 during his undergraduate days at Lehigh University.

By Nov. 30, 2016 11:14 a.m. ET Text Size Medium Large Netflix’s iOS and Android apps can now store downloaded content for offline viewing. Photo: Bloomberg News \nSparking excitement is a vital part of Netflix ’s business model. And the company’s announcement on Wednesday that it will now allow people to download shows on their mobile devices is a good start. Wall Street clearly likes the news, and the shares were up 2% early Wednesday to $120. \nNetflix announced the new option in a Tweet and short blog post but the company didn’t release many details. The new feature works on iOS and Android devices but not all content will be downloadable – so far it looks like the shows you can watch offline include Netflix’s original content and a few other programs. \nThe download option isn’t unique to Netflix. In fact, Amazon’s Prime Video streaming app has long allowed offline viewing. \nBut even if it isn’t novel, it’s a good move for Netflix in a week when other companies have been stealing the spotlight. The competition to package and distribute content got even tougher this week as AT&T launched a new service called DirectTV Now that allows people a relatively inexpensive cable TV option, via the Internet. \nIn the longer term, Netflix will have to find some new hits to make its service stand out as other companies continue to innovate. For now, offline content gives users one more reason to keep their subscriptions alive, and it might entice some new subscribers too. \nBig Picture: Netflix will now allow subscribers to download shows, a long-overdue option that could help it keep and grow subscribers. \nMore from Barron’s Next:",

      "text": "Official: Netflix Adding Offline Playback to Android App November 30, 2016 - Written By Tom Dawson \nNetflix has been around for a good long time now, and has been the driving force behind the idea of “cord cutting” since its streaming service gained legs. In the past couple of years, the service has made as impossible as they can do to make it impossible to get rid of the service thanks to original shows like House of Cards and more recently, The Crown. For a lot of people, their primary way of watching Netflix is probably tuning in from a phone or from a tablet, especially if these users are watching their favorite shows on the move. Now, after speculation surrounding the feature Netflix is finally adding offline playback to their mobile apps via downloading. \nAs a press release from Netflix themselves states, this new feature will be available on both Android as well as iOS, and will be available to all plans, too. For a lot of people, being able to download videos to watch on the move is something they’ve been asking Netflix for for a long time, not only does it save on data , but it also speeds things up and ensures the best quality. If you’re watching something on the train or on the bus to work, it’s likely that your signal will yo-yo from being great to not being there at all in some cases. As such, it’s good to hear that Netflix is finally making changes for the better, and that people will be able to make the most of fast WiFi at home, as well as the ample storage on their phone. Whether or not Netflix have taken into account microSD card storage here is unclear, but given that the below screenshot from the press release appears to be of the Google Pixel, which doesn’t have a microSD card slot, this might not be part of Netflix’s plan for the moment. \nAs of writing, it’s unclear which version of the Netflix app has this new feature rolled into it, and the press release only advises users to “update your Netflix app to the most recent version” so it’s likely the update is currently making its way to the Play Store to go live any moment.

      "text": "Continue reading the main story Photo Netflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline. Credit Elise Amendola/Associated Press Netflix announced on Wednesday that users worldwide can download some videos to their mobile devices instead of streaming them over cellular data, a feature that could keep eyeballs on the app when internet signals are spotty or unavailable. Users boarding an airplane, leaving on a road trip or ducking into the subway, for example, could use Wi-Fi to download their favorite movies and TV shows beforehand, then view them when the cellular signal dips out. Netflix said that initially, only some of the content in its library will be available offline via the feature, available in the latest version of its app on phones and tablets using iOS or Android. The company did not specify how many programs would become available for download later, saying only that there would be “more on the way.” Even in areas with strong cellular coverage, watching content offline would allow users to avoid depleting their monthly data limits, addressing a major frustration of mobile video, which eats up data ravenously. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story Customers who watch only a limited amount of video before incurring overage fees with their cellular carriers are more likely to stop watching videos — an unpalatable option for media companies like Netflix that want to keep eyes glued to their products. AT&T also appears to have come to a similar conclusion. In announcing DirecTV Now , a television service that can be streamed on mobile devices, the company said on Monday that its cellular customers would be able to watch shows without that usage counting toward their monthly data limits. “The last thing you want to do when you’re binging or enjoying entertainment is trying to calculate how many gigs I’m using or where I am in my data plan,” Brad Bentley, AT&T’s chief marketing officer, said on Monday, referring to gigabytes of data. For Netflix users, the company offers a choice between downloading videos in “standard” quality or “higher” quality, which has a higher resolution but takes up more storage space. \nFollow Daniel Victor on Twitter @bydanielvictor .",

      "text": "Netflix Now Allows Users to Download Content to Watch on the Go By Joe Allen | November 30, 2016 | 11:06am Share Tweet Text \nIt’s about time. Netflix announced Wednesday that it will allow users to download content to watch without internet, and the addition comes at no extra cost to users. The new feature will be available globally on smartphones and tablets with Android or iOS, though downloading rights for certain titles may vary by country. \n“Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode,” Netflix wrote on Twitter . “Your favorite stories are now available for download any time.” \nNetflix has lagged behind some other streaming services, like Amazon, in this regard, but the service seems to understand that allowing shows to be downloaded will actually give it an extra edge. Now, go update your app and download that Gilmore Girls revival everyone seems to be talking about. Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time. pic.twitter.com/g7QZA3TyE8",

      "text": "Netflix Announces Offline Viewing Feature Netflix Announces Offline Viewing Feature Netflix \nAcquiescing to popular demand, Netflix announced a download feature to allow offline binge-watching for subscribers. \nNetflix has given binge-viewing fans what they’ve been clamouring for by announcing the introduction of an offline viewing. \nWith the new feature being rolled out immediately, certain programming will offer a download option as an alternative to streaming content using an internet connection, and it will come at no extra cost. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where internet is expensive or limited,” the company announced via its official blog on Wednesday morning (November 30th). \n“Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nMore: Sean Astin and others join the cast of ‘Stranger Things’ season 2 \nAt first, only a select range of licensed and original content will actually be able to be downloaded – Netflix says that ‘Orange Is The New Black’, ‘Narcos’ and ‘The Crown’ are among those series that subscribers can download – but that it will be extended to more films and TV shows in the near future. \nThe feature is to be included in all new updates for phones and tablets on both iOS and Android. \nIt comes more than a year after Netflix’s rival Amazon Prime introduced its own offline viewing feature in September 2015. The move is long overdue for subscribers in some countries into which Netflix has recently expanded where bandwidth is often lower, making streaming more difficult. \n“Amazon is definitely encroaching on Netflix’s turf,” said tech analyst Paul Verna at EMarketer in response to the news via the L.A. Times. “It doesn’t seem like something that requires a tremendous investment on their part to enable, so I guess at a certain point they decided, ‘Why not.’”",

      "text": "Netflix Finally Made It Possible to Watch Your Favorite TV Shows and Movies Offline By Email Netflix \nWe've all been there: You've just gotten settled in to your (probably germ-infested) airplane seat for a long flight across the country. You've got your comfy pants, your comfy socks and your don't-even-try-to-talk-to-me-seatmate headphones. You pull out your iPad, giddy with the anticipation over being able to finish the Gilmore Girls revival while you travel home from Thanksgiving, when the worst thing happens. The plane doesn't have WiFi . \nOr it has Internet, but it costs way more money than you're willing to spend (here's looking at you, United!). Or it has reasonably-priced Internet, but it's so slow that you'd have to have the patience of Mother Theresa to get through even the opening credits of your favorite show. \nWell, since airplanes aren't going to up their game anytime soon, Netflix is going to instead. Photos \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life Fashion Secrets Revealed \nAs of this very moment in time, users will be able to download programming right off of Netflix to watch anytime, Internet connection or data plan be damned. The company teased the change earlier this month, but today Netflix announced that it was coming to all users today. \nAs always, there are a few things you'll need to know. First, this only works on the app (for Android or iOS), so you won't be able to stream offline on your laptop—but iPad and iPhone users, rejoice! Second, the feature isn't available for every single title just yet. It presumably takes a bit of time to build this out, so while it will eventually be a company-wide option, for now there's an ever-growing list of shows you can download. Fortunately it includes heavy-hitters like Orange Is the New Black and The Crown , so we won't be deprived while we wait for the full rollout. \nAnd now, we celebrate the fact that we'll never have to (gasp!) talk to our travel companions again.

      "text": "One of the only downsides of the life-improver that is Netflix is the fact that you can only really use it if you have WiFi to live stream shows and movies. That’s excellent for houses, apartments, and gyms, but leaves you high and dry (or paying pricey fees) on many planes, trains, long car rides, and other random situations that might strongly benefit from some on-screen entertainment.\nBut this morning, Netflix announced that’s changing: Now, users can download shows and movies and watch them later, at their leisure, sans internet, by clicking the download button on the details page of a program. The only caveat: It doesn’t work on laptops—only tablets and phones (for iOS and Android users).\nGetty Images\nMORE: Netflix and Chill is Good for Your Relationship Still, pretty exciting stuff, especially during the travel-packed holiday season. (OK, so Netflix missed Thanksgiving, but there’s still plenty of other occasions coming up that might demand you sit in a car or plane for hours!) In case you were wondering, there’s tons of holiday movies on Netflix right now, including the all-time classic, “Love, Actually.” Score!\nNow, if only Hulu, HBO Go, and Amazon Video would follow Netflix’s lead…\nMORE: A Definitive Guide to the 10 Best Fall Books of 2016 ",

      "text": "By Michelle Lulic an hour ago \nThanks to Netflix's Thanksgiving weekend premiere of the four-part Gilmore Girls revival series , Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life , audiences were reunited with Lorelai, Rory, and Emily just in time for the holidays. The small Connecticut town of Stars Hollow has already proven itself to be a holiday tourist attraction. Over the course of the show's seven seasons, the Gilmores have brought us along for the town's annual winter festivities and for their family's holiday tradition in a few Gilmore Girls Christmas episodes . As with any Gilmore get together, Christmas always came with a healthy portion of family drama. \nLorelai's love of the snow was present numerous times, but actual Christmas family gatherings were rare and few. In fact, when looking at all seven season, there seems to be only three episodes were the actual holiday of Christmas is acknowledged. That seems a little strange to me, even as a huge fan, but who am I to argue with the almighty power of the Gilmores? After all, it's not like Stars Hollow couldn't turn every regular day into an event. \nSo, get ready to marathon even more Gilmore Girls episodes than you already have. Here are the Gilmore Girls Christmas episodes every fan should revisit before December 25. \"Forgiveness And Stuff\" (Season 1, Episode 10) \nOur first Christmas with the Gilmores was surprisingly un-merry. However, \"Forgiveness And Stuff\" was exactly what one would expect from a holiday with the Gilmores. When the episode first begins, Lorelai is at odds with Rory, and Emily is at odds with Lorelai. Lorelai is uninvited from Emily and Richard's annual Christmas party, but it's only afterward that the real drama ensues. \nThe Gilmores' night takes a turn for the worst when Richard Gilmore has an unexpected heart attack, and Lorelai must rush to the hospital to meet Emily and Rory. Thankfully, once everyone knows he's going to be OK, the family somehow finds their way back together. Meanwhile, back in Stars Hollow, Miss Patty is putting together the town's perfectly imperfect nativity scene, and Lorelai gives Luke a gift he just can't refuse. \"Merry Fisticuffs\" (Season 7, Episode 10) \nIn this episode, it's not Christmas yet, but Christmas is definitely creeping up on the town of Stars Hollow. Lorelai and Christopher are preparing for their next chapter together, Kirk is selling holiday wrapping paper, and Emily is planning another one of her parties. Christmas music acts as the soundtrack for Christopher and Luke's fight over Lorelai, and even Emily knows that Lorelai and Christopher's marriage is falling apart. \"Santa's Secret Stuff\" (Season 7, Episode 11) \nThe Season 7, Episode 11 episode, \"Santa's Secret Stuff,\" is where the seemingly cursed holiday of Christmas finally starts to feel a little bit merrier. Christmas Day has passed them by, but the Gilmore girls are determined to celebrate the holiday together — even if Rory cheated during her stay in London. They do everything from decorating the tree to going on a much needed shopping spree, but it just isn't a Gilmore Christmas without the drama. \nThose may be the only specific Gilmore Girls Christmas episodes, but the snow appears in multiple Gilmore Girls episodes — with cameos in Season 2, Episode 10, \"The Bracebridge Dinner,\" and in Season 3, Episode 10, \"That'll Do, Pig.\" And, in Season 5, Episode 11, \"Women Of Questionable Morals,\" Lorelai tries to deny her love for the snow until Luke gifts her the greatest gift of all: her very own ice rink. The holiday season certainly isn't lost on the town of Stars Hollow. \nBut if there's one thing to say about few Christmas episodes we have had with the Gilmores, it's that their family reunions certainly imitate reality. Continue to deck the halls for the holiday season... and just be happy that Emily Gilmore won't be sitting at your dinner table. \nImages: Warner Bros. Television; Giphy ; Netflix (2) Must Reads ",

However, there is a catch: not every movie or show is in the catalog, notes CNET.\nPhoto by Matt Perreault Why Netflix added this feature “Netflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost,” the streaming firm said in a blog post .\nDespite regular demand for such a feature from subscribers, Netflix has long resisted it, saying that mobile networks would eventually come up with a technology that will keep users from getting disconnected. But according to CNET, two things forced the streaming giant to come up with the offline viewing option. First, rivals like Amazon Prime have come up with offline viewing. Second, Netflix’s global expansion into countries like India, where mobile networks are not so strong, makes such a feature much desirable.\nTo download shows or movies, subscribers must update their Netflix app and then look for an arrow symbol near the title. Also subscribers can select programs available for download from the new “Available for Download” menu.\nTo access the shows and movies that you have already downloaded, go to the “My Downloads” option in the app. Here, subscribers will be able to choose individual TV episodes and also delete the titles which are no longer wanted. The new feature is available on both iOS and Android.\nNot all titles available for download Many of Netflix’s own series and films will be available for download, such as House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, The Crown and Stranger Things. However, some licensed shows and movies won’t be available for download, like the BBC’s Sherlock series and Disney’s animated hit Zootopia. Even some of Netflix’s originals like the film The Little Prince won’t be available for download . H owever, Netflix says it will make more titles available for download in the future.\nThis new feature is surely a good addition, but some are surprised by it.\nTom Harrington from the consultancy Enders Analysis said, “It’s surprising because just weeks ago they said it wasn’t going to happen. You can understand why they wouldn’t want to do it because it opens up a whole pot of rights issues. Offering a download service will cost Netflix more.”\nHowever, Netflix didn’t want to be left behind “or compared unfavourably to rivals” as others are already offering such option like Amazon and Sky, the expert added.\nThe post Netflix Finally Adds Download Option To Watch Shows Offline appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Netflix allows subscribers to binge-watch shows offline By Reuters Media Today at 1:03 p.m. The Netflix logo is shown in this illustration photograph. (Reuters/Mike Blake) \nVideo streaming pioneer Netflix Inc has added an option that allows subscribers to download shows at no additional cost on their mobile device to watch without an internet connection. Recommended for you Rooms are pricey during tall ships festival \nNetflix signaled in recent months it would add an offline viewing option to better compete as the streaming video market becomes more and more crowded. Amazon.com Inc’s rival streaming video service, Prime Video, has had this option for about a year. \nWhile the new option announced on Wednesday is available for all of Netflix’s subscribers, it could have greater appeal in international markets such as Africa and Asia, where internet service is less ubiquitous than it is in the United States. \nThe international market is becoming the main driver of growth for Netflix. Of their 86.7 million subscribers, 47.5 million of them come from the United States. \nGrowth among U.S. subscribers has slowed in 2016. Netflix added just 370,000 subscribers during the third quarter and only 4.3 million since the third quarter of last year, suggesting they are reaching a saturation point. \nIn that same time frame, Netflix has added 13.2 million international subscribers, including 3.2 million in the third quarter. Much of that has to do with Netflix’s expansion by more than 130 countries earlier this year to over 190 nations currently. China is a notable holdout. \nNot everything in Netflix’s vast library is available to download just yet, including the recently released “Gilmore Girls” revival. Currently available shows include Netflix-owned “Stranger Things,” “The Crown” and “Narcos” along with licensed shows and movies like “Parks and Recreation” and “Spotlight.” \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their 'Stranger Things' binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, wrote in a blog post. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Alphabet Inc's Android and Apple Inc's iOS platforms, the company said. \nNetflix shares rose as much as 2.4 percent before it eased, up 0.1 percent to $117.62 on Wednesday on the Nasdaq.

      "text": "It just got even easier to binge on Netflix.\nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway.\nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix (NFLX, Tech30) memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button.\nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go.\nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now.\nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability.\nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago.\nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete” downloaded titles before attempting to download new content.\nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title.\nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.”",

Now the company has finally added that feature for any phone or tablet running Android 4.4.2 or later. [ Also InfoWorld: Find out which is the best browser for Android smartphones . | Get a digest of the day's top tech stories in the InfoWorld Daily newsletter . ] \nTodd Spangler reports for Variety: \nThe latest versions of the company’s mobile apps include a “download” button on the details page for a film or TV series — although not all titles on the streaming service are currently available to watch offline. The app also includes a new menu item showing what’s available to download. \nNetflix said it will add more series and movies to download in the future. Original series including “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos,” “House of Cards,” “Stranger Things,” “Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “Master of None” and “The Crown” are available for download starting Wednesday. Other titles available for offline viewing include TV shows “Supernatural,” “The Office,” “The Flash” and “The 100,” and animated movies “Minions” and “Home.” \nNetflix’s new download feature is included in all plans and available for Android and iOS phones and tablets. To download titles, users will need iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later as well as the latest update of Netflix’s app. \nMore at Variety \nNetflix announced the new feature in a press release , and the company also has an offline viewing page up in its official Help Center for those who might run into problems downloading videos. \nNews about Netflix letting Android users download TV shows and movies for offline viewing hit the Android subreddit and the folks there shared their thoughts about it: \nJayveesac : “This is a game-changer for long-haul air travel and in-flight entertainment.” \nC8-H10-N4-O2 : “Just got the app update and the download button is available! \nLooks like you can queue multiple items at once though it will only download one item at a time. You can download multiple episodes too - not sure if there's an upper limit.” \nReggie14 : “You select them individually, but there isn't an obvious limit to the number of episodes you can select for download. \nFor the targeted community, storage space is likely to significantly limit the number you can download. But, the sizes are smaller than I expected. Downloads default to low quality, but you can change that to high quality in the app settings. For comparison, Narcos episodes are roughly ~250MB at low quality, and ~500MB at high quality. That's pretty efficient. I watched part of the high-quality download, and I think it looks quite good. \nSome sort of automated-download system involving subscriptions would have been nice, where it automatically keeps the next X many next unwatched episodes. Maybe we'll see that in a future update. But, at least in the US, I think downloading is supposed to be the exceptional case, so I'd be a little surprised to see that. If you typically watch shows streaming off a Roku, but occasionally watch something on your phone, you'd end up with a lot of unnecessary downloads.” \nMhelmen : “Can’t transfer to SD Card though...Huge bummer for my part :\\” \nMGuDiM : “Not everything is downloadable unfortunately, even Netflix owned shows such as Daredevil and Jessica Jones are not available for download.” \nScarlet_Isotopes : “Limited shows and no SD support. Basically useless for all the people with 8-16GB phones.” \nIkeelu : “I hope they bring this to the web version so I can download to my Chromebook. Maybe I've been blind and just haven't noticed it yet. I usually download a movie or two on it from Google play.” \njoacopotter7 : “Awesome news. I wonder what stops them from making every movie/series available for download though. ” \nA_Wonder_Named_Stevi : “Quality of the downloaded videos will be standard, you can chance this in the settings to High. Of course this will take more space.” \nMononon : “Interestingly, Young Justice isn't available to download. Wonder if that implies anything about Season 3's chances of being on Netflix.” \nMore at Reddit A first look at Fedora 25 \nFedora 25 was released recently, and some writers have been putting it through its paces. One journalist at PCWorld had some positive thoughts about Fedora 25 in a recent article. \nAlex Campbell reports for PCWorld: \nI really enjoyed my afternoon playing with the new Fedora on my Dell Inspiron testing laptop—mostly because it took so little time to install. Since I prefer GNOME to Ubuntu’s Unity, it was a bonus that the easy installation resulted in Ubuntu 16.04 being supplanted by Fedora 25 on my laptop. Fedora 25 is built for an amazing GNOME experience, but like any Linux distribution, you can choose a flavor that comes with your preferred desktop, or install whatever desktop you want. \nOne place fedora is a slight disadvantage is in the software download department. While most applications you’ll use will come from Fedora’s repositories, there are some applications (like Chrome) that require you to go fetch a package online or use a third-party repository. \nIn instances where proprietary software is offered online, I still feel that Ubuntu .deb packages are more common than .rpm packages. Again, the majority of the software you’ll use will likely come from the Fedora repo, so that’s only an issue for a small subset of software. \nOne of the principal arguments I hear about Linux's inaccessibility for average desktop users is that it’s hard to set up. Fedora 25 definitely attacks that problem head on. The experience is smooth and pleasant from download to first boot, which is why I’ll be recommending Fedora over Ubuntu for newbies and novices. \nMore at PCWorld A review of the Sony Xperia XZ phone \nSony has released some very good Android phones, but the company never seems to make as much of a splash in the media as Google or Samsung. Fortunately, a writer at the Sydney Morning Herald has a full review of Sony’s Xperia XZ Android phone. \nTim Biggs reports for The Sydney Morning Herald: \nUltimately the XZ just beats out Google's Pixel to be my personal favourite phone of the year so far (I say so far because I'm yet to give LG's V20 a proper look), but if you're looking to grab the latest and greatest Android handset your decision is hardly cut and dried. The two phones (and, indeed, most flagship Androids) are similar in many ways, and it will come down to which little enhancements you prefer. \nThe Pixel has a newer processor, more RAM and the latest version of Android, while the XZ has a bigger battery with (unproven) longevity claims, an SD card slot and is IP68 certified dust proof and water resistant. The Pixel comes in your choice of 5-inch or 5.5-inch, while the XZ is a comfortable middle ground. Both feel great in the hand and have quick fingerprint sensors, although I prefer Sony's side-mounted unit to Google's rear one. The XZ is easier on the wallet, but not by much. \nThe Pixel comes with some very Google features like the all-seeing Assistant, tight integration with Google Photos and fantastic, artist-focused wallpapers built-in. Meanwhile the XZ comes with some very Sony features like PlayStation compatibility, Hi-Res audio and a brilliant display. The XZ lacks the software wizadry that makes Pixel's camera the undisputed king of all-rounders, with unmatched low-light photography, but its autofocus is fast and its panel of sensors nails white balance and colour correctness much more often. \nGiven the above I would already be leaning towards Sony's offering, but if I needed a tie breaker it would be aesthetics. There is simply no other smartphone that looks like the XZ, from its square minimalist shell to its cut-out lock screen, and I much prefer it to the rounded edges and candy icons of virtually every other 2016 phone. \nDid you miss a roundup?

Well, as of today it is possible for subscribers to binge all their favorites off Netflix! \nThe offline feature is live so make sure you update your Netflix app. Once it is updated you will be able to hit download next to the content you want to enjoy when you have limited or no internet service. \nThis couldn’t have come at a better time as holiday travel is upon us – thank you Netflix! Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode.

      "text": "No Internet? No problem. Netflix subscribers can now download content to watch offline.\nThe latest app update includes a download button on the details page of a movie or TV series.\nVisit the \"Available for Download\" option in the left-hand menu, or just take your chances looking for available content. Then click the downward-facing arrow to save and watch the video later—on the subway, during a camping trip, or in that basement dead zone. \n\"While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we've often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,\" Eddy Wu, director of product innovation, said in an announcement.\nThe feature is included in all plans, and accessible for Android- or iOS-based phones and tablets. You'll need a device running iOS 8.0 or later or Android 4.4.2 or later, as well as plenty of device storage space.\n\"Many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you're offline,\" Wu added.\nOriginals Orange is The New Black , Narcos , Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt , and The Crown , as well as popular shows like Bates Motel , Brooklyn Nine-Nine , and Suits , are available for download now. Or save Sicario , Good Will Hunting , and Blackfish for that long drive to the in-laws' this holiday season.\nBulk download options and viewing times vary based on individual licensing agreements. For some, offline watching must be completed within 48 hours of pressing play; expiration dates can be found on the \"My Downloads\" page of the Netflix app. In some cases, the company may limit the number of titles one user can load onto their device at a time. Still in its infancy, the new feature may require some personal trial and error.\nNetflix often cites its belief in the ubiquity of high-speed Internet as the reason for its reluctance to add offline viewing. But Chief Content Officer Ted Sarandos earlier this month hinted at the new function—perhaps in an effort to keep up with streaming rival Amazon Video .\nAmazon became the first online streaming service to support offline viewing when it launched the ability to download select movies and TV episodes from Prime Video to iOS and Android devices in September last year. In contrast with Netflix—which is rolling this out globally—Amazon initially offered the option to viewers in the US, Germany, and the UK.",

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. ... more > View Comments Print By Ken Shepherd - The Washington Times   \nCatching up on your Netflix queue while flying to Grandma’s house for Christmas is a dicey proposition with spotty airplane Wi-Fi. And if Grandma is a little old school, well, forget about it when you’re staying at her place. Until now. \nJust in time for the holiday travel season, the streaming-video service on Wednesday unveiled a new “available for download” feature on its Android and iOS apps for smartphones and tablets. The feature is not available for desktop users accessing their accounts on a web browser. \n“Airplane mode. Road trip mode. Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,” the company announced in a tweet from its @Netflix account. \nWhile not every title in the service’s vast catalog is available for download, many popular selections, such as Netflix original series “Stranger Things” and “The Crown” are. Kids movies like 2015’s “Minions” and 2014’s “Paddington” are also available for download, as are some popular TV network series like CW’s “The Flash” and “Supergirl.” \nThe rollout for the feature is global, so while Netflix catalog selections vary by country or region, the ability to download favorite content will transcend national borders. \n“Netflix execs had previously raised the prospect of allowing downloads for offline viewing, but they had suggested the company would first launch the feature in countries with constrained bandwidth infrastructure,” Variety noted Wednesday . \nAirplane mode.

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don’t have an internet connection.\nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix’s 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service’s decade-long history.\nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com, has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It’s something that also has been available on YouTube’s popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its “Red” premium service.\nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren’t available on HBO’s internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature.\nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device.\nNot all of the selections in Netflix’s video library can be downloaded, although several of the service’s most popular shows, including “Orange Is The New Black,” ”House of Cards,” and “Stranger Things,” are now available to watch offline.\nDownloadable movies include “Spotlight,” this year’s Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix.\nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster.\nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable.\nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.\nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix’s expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing.\nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S.\nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix’s steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix’s DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming.\nNetflix’s DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.\n",
