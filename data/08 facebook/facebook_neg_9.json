      "text": "One average, Facebook is home to 1.18 billion daily active users  -- from CEOs, to students, to companies. And while the community is clearly there, connecting with them from a marketing standpoint isn't always easy. \nFor brands,  posting on Facebook alone isn't enough anymore -- especially for ones just starting out. Sure, you can throw money at your efforts to drive people to your Facebook Page and send them to your website, but that only works if you're smart about it.\nOne way to do just that is to create optimized Facebook Ads targeted at the right audience. Optimized ads can help you spend your PPC budget wisely and see a positive return on your investment. \nSo, what does optimized Facebook advertising actually look like? If you're looking for some great examples, you've come to the right place. In this post, we'll quickly go over the three overarching formats for Facebook Ads: right column, desktop News Feed, and mobile News Feed. Then, we'll show you eight different types of Facebook Ads, each with real-life examples -- along with some insights into why that ad is so successful.\nBut before we get to these examples, let's discuss the four components of a good Facebook Ad (or any ad, really) regardless of its type ...\n4 Components of Successful Facebook Ads 1) It's visual. Visual content is not only treated more favorably in the Facebook algorithm , but it's also  more likely to be shared and remembered than written content. The lesson for Facebook marketers? No matter what type of ad you create, your image needs to be visually appealing.\nCheck out this blog post for a detailed guide to image sizes for various ad units on Facebook along with some tips on posting visual content.\n2) It's relevant. Relevance is critical for success when using Facebook advertising. Remember, you are spending money when someone views or clicks on your ad (depending on the settings you use). If you're showing ads that aren’t relevant to your target audience, you're wasting your time and money and will likely not see success with any kind of advertising.\nBack in February 2015, Facebook  launched a feature in the Facebook advertising platform that rates your ads and gives you a relevance score, similar to Ad Rank in Google AdWords. The more relevant your ad image, ad copy, and destination page is to your audience, the higher your score is -- and the more favorably Facebook will treat your ads.\n3) It includes an enticing value proposition. A value proposition tells the reader why they should click on your ad to learn more about your product. How is your product or service different from any other? Why should the viewer click on your ad to see your website?\nYour value proposition should be believable. For example, saying you have the greatest sandwiches in the world will not make people come to your business's Page, but maybe offering 20% off will. Or, perhaps adding social proof will help -- something like, \"Sandwiches loved by over one million people every year! Come try yours today and get 20% off your order with this coupon.\"\n4) It has a clear call-to-action. A beautiful and relevant ad is great, but without a call-to-action (CTA), your viewer might not know what to do next. Add a CTA like “Buy now and save X%,” or “Offer ends soon” and add a sense of urgency to your viewer. Your CTA should encourage people to click on your ad now.\nThe 3 Primary Formats for Facebook Ads (With Examples) Format 1: The Right Column Ad \nSource: Facebook \nThis type of ad is the most traditional on Facebook, it appears on the right side of a user’s Facebook News Feed. This is the first type of advertising Facebook had, and it still exists today.\nAlthough ads in the News Feed are likely to get higher engagement metrics due to its native advertising features, right column ads shouldn’t be forgotten. We often see less expensive clicks and conversions when using these ads. In order for a right column ad to be successful, it needs to be relevant, have a value proposition, a good visual, and have a call-to-action. Let’s look at an example below from Winc (formermly known as Club W): \n\n\nHere's what makes this ad great: It's visual.  The visual is clear, simple, and appealing to all types of wine-lovers. It's relevant.  This came up in my wine-obssesed colleague's News Feed. Need I say more? Two thumbs up on relevance. It includes an enticing value prop. Three bottles for $19? What a steal. They also pull the viewer in with an additional value: a discount on their first order of wine. It has a strong call-to-action.  The word \"get\" is strong call-to-action language , and it's used twice here. A time limit on this offer would have made it even stronger. Format 2: The Desktop News Feed Ad Source: Facebook \nThis type of ad appears directly in a user's News Feed when they access Facebook on a desktop computer, and it looks more like native advertising. In our experience, these ads have a higher engagement rate than right column ads, but they can also be more expensive. These ads must follow  organic Facebook posts best practices  and be both engaging and visual.\nThis is how an ad from Amazon looks in the News Feed on a desktop:\n\nHere's what makes this ad great: It's visual. Not only is this image larger than the right column ad display, but it also uses warm colors , white space , and directional lines which drew my eye towards the featured product. It's relevant.  As a cat mom, this offer is clearly tailored to my consumer needs.  It includes an enticing value prop.  Amazon has advertised a self-cleaning litter box here, which is of tremendous value for any cat owner. Additionally, it shared the strong customer ratings below an image of the product. (Social proof, anyone?) It has a clear call-to-action.  Amazon instructs me to click on its ad today, after which point the deal for the litter box will presumably disappear. \"Now\" is strong CTA language that compels clicks. Format 3: The Mobile News Feed Ad \nSource: Facebook \nLike the desktop News Feed ad, this type of ad appears in the user's mobile News Feed and displays like an organic posts from people and Pages that they follow. \nThis is what a mobile News Feed ad for The New York Times looks like:\n\nHere's what makes this ad great: It's visual.  The quirky cartoon drew my eye as I scrolled on my mobile News Feed through lots of text and photography. The nontraditional illustration pulled me in for a closer look at the content. It's relevant.  I'm a person in my 20s, and I used to write about health care. This is an article I would definitely be interested in reading, and it helps that the ad appears like a native post promoting an article in my New Feed. It includes an enticing value prop.  The ad shows me which of my Facebook friends also like, and presumably read, The New York Times. This social proof makes me more likely to click and read the article. It has a clear call-to-action.  This ad is dedicated to increasing the page's Likes, and by asking a question in the ad, the call-to-action makes me want to click the article to learn more. Now that we've covered the three main ad formats, let's dig into a sampling of the wide variety of post types you can use.\n8 Types of Facebook Advertising & Some of the Best Facebook Ad Examples 1) The Facebook Video Ad Video ads appear fairly large in the user’s New Feed and offer more engaging content than static posts. And with  8 billion videos  being watched on Facebook every day, it serves as an interesting -- and potentially profitable -- ad type for marketers to try out.   \nNeed some inspiration? Check out this example from Key Jewlers below:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  Even though this is a video, I have a general idea of what I will be watching, thanks to the screen capture it started with. Additionally, I can understand the gist of this ad without playing with the sound on, which is important given that  85% of videos on Facebook are now viewed without sound. It's relevant.   It's relevant to me because I was recently scouring jewelry websites, specifically for necklaces like the one in the ad. It's valuable.  Kay shows potential customers the value of purchasing with the help of the happy reaction from the woman receiving the gift in the ad. Plus, who doesn't love dogs? It has a solid call-to-action.  This ad is set up to drive Page Likes, which is an easy, one-click way for me to get more relevant content served up to me. How can you create your own video ad ? First, understand Facebook video ad requirements  including length and video size. We suggest keeping your video as short as possible, even though Facebook allows you to upload a much larger video. Create a video that displays your product or service, and upload directly to the Facebook ads manager  by following these instructions .  \n\n2) The Photo Ad Another type of rich media advertising on Facebook is a post of an image. This is one of the most popular types of ads ever since Facebook began favoring visual content . The optimal size for News Feed photo ads is 1200x628 pixels, otherwise your image will get cropped. Adjust your image based on the target audience’s needs and by what will appeal to them the most.\nHere's an example of a photo ad from NatureBox:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  The image shows you exactly what you're getting, and it calls out the “free sample” CTA well. It's relevant.  Everyone likes to snack. In all seriousness, the person who saw this is a fan of several lifestyle subscription companies, which is what NatureBox is.  It's valuable.   This ad is full of value. First, the “free trial” callout is the first thing your eyes go to when looking at the image. Second, it clearly mentions the healthy aspects of the goodies in its product. It has a clear call-to-action.  Nature Box is asking you to try its free sample. It couldn’t be easier to know your next step. 3) The Multi-Product Ad Multi-product ads allow advertisers to showcase multiple products within one ad. Viewers can scroll through the images and click on individual links to each product. You can promote multiple of anything, not just products -- like different blog posts, ebooks, or webinars. These ads can be created in the Facebook Power Editor. \nHere's an example of a multi-product ad from Shutterfly, along with the additional images that are used in the ad. Each image has a different offer, to appeal to many different demographics in one ad.\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  This series of images leands on a consistent color pallette , making it feel both cohesive and on brand.  (Having a cute cat doesn’t hurt either.) It's relevant.  The person who saw this loves taking photos and creating sentimental gifts. Spot on, right? It's valuable.  There is a very clear value for the user, 40% off each of the products being advertised. The code and sale end date are also clear in the ad description.  This ad also has an added level of value, it is showing the many different ways people can use Shutterfly, in ways many may not be aware of. It has a clear call-to-action.  I know I need to use this before February 17th when this deal expires, so I would be encouraged to take action right away.   4) The Local Ad Local ads on Facebook only work if your business has a physical location that you are trying to drive real foot traffic to. If you fall into this category, then locally targeted Facebook ads may be a great fit for you, as you can hyper-target on Facebook down to the mile.\nIf your business has an offer or event going on at your store, set up a few Facebook ads that appear only to people within a short distance of your store. Have these ads appear a few days prior to the event and on mobile devices while the event is happening. You may want to reach some people the day of the event who happen to be in the area and checking their Facebook account on their smartphones.\nTake this ad for example from Mizzou Campus Dining:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  This image has college pride, a variety of salty and sweet treats, and a well-known logo to attract hungry college students.  It's relevant.  This ad is likely only being shown to students on campus who are in its target audience. It also mentions the sports game that was going on at the time, and plays to the student’s current needs: snacks and Subway sandwiches. It's valuable.  Mizzou Market is telling hungry college students that it has everything students need for the big game.  It has a clear call-to-action.  This ad  has the option to show directions, making it extremely easy for a college student on the go to follow the walking directions to this market. 5) The Offer Ad An offer ad is a newer form of Facebook advertising where a business can promote a discount on a product or service that can be redeemed on Facebook. The benefit of this? It eliminates one step in the buyer's journey, which ultimately increases sales.\nThe offer ad has many benefits. First, it drives the user directly to the offer. The user claims it directly on Facebook, removing any added friction of needing to to go to your website for the offer. You also can reach any type of audience that you want, as all the Facebook targeting options are possible.\nFinally, you can include all the information needed for the user to decide if they want it or not, including the time period it is usable, the number of people who has already claimed it, and the exact amount the offer is. This will eliminate any unqualified clicks, which cost you money.\nHere's an example of an offer ad Boston Sports Club:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  The featured photo uses bold colors and clear typography to draw my attention to the details of the offer, and the woman exercising gives me an idea of what I could gain from purchasing the offer. It's relevant.  I recently moved to Boston and have been searching for gyms in my area online, so this ad is highly relevant to my recent Facebook and search activity. It's valuable.  Paying $5 for a monthly gym membership is a great deal. Even though the price may increase in the future, the low price definitely makes me want to click. It has a clear call-to-action.  The CTA emphasizes that the discount offer is limited and should be claimed quickly using the word \"hurry\" and telling me when the offer expires. 6) The Event Ad Event ads promote a specific event. The CTA on these ads usually send users directly to the ticket purchase page, wherever that happens to be hosted.\nUsing this type of ad will help drive a targeted group of people to attend your event. These will show up in the News Feed of the specific audience you've chosen.  Events are a big part of most businesses, but getting people to attend even a small event, can be tricky. Promoting your event to a targeted specific audience on Facebook can help drive the right kind of attendees. \nA good ad in this format will clearly show the benefit of attending the event: The price, dates, and a clear CTA to purchase a ticket. The events ad below for the Tortuga Music Festival displays the date and time and the bands playing:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.   The picture alone is worth a thousand words about how much fun this concert would be. Not only is it on the beach, it was also taken on a gorgeous day and the stage looks amazing. Also, it  clearly represents what to expect during the event, and it catches the eye as someone scrolls through their News Feed. (The beautiful ocean water definitely helps.) It's relevant.  The person who saw this ad is a fan of Kenny Chesney and has been to his concerts before. They're also originally from Florida, which is where this event takes place.  It's valuable.  Since the image was taken on a beautiful day, it looks like an ideal place to be -- especially to those of us viewing it from our office desks. It also clearly tells you the cost of the ticket so you know before you click. (This is also good for the advertiser: By including the price, the ad allows users to self-select based on whether they can afford the ticket. If they can’t afford it, they won’t click through, thus saving the advertiser money on unqualified clicks.) It has a clear call-to-action.  The CTA is clear: \"Buy.\" The advertisers also add urgent wording with the title “Time is running out!”, encouraging you to purchase your ticket now before it's too late. 7) The Retargeting Ad A retargeting ad promotes an ad to a specific list of previously identified people. Have you ever seen ads follow you across the internet after visiting a certain website? Then you've seen a retargeting ad. \nFacebook has the same capability. An advertiser can advertise to a list of leads or customers by uploading a list of email addresses it already has into the Power Editor to make a custom audience. A good retargeting ad acknowledges that the brand knows you're already interested in its product. (Because, let’s face it ... retargeting can be a little creepy.)\nLast week, I started shopping around for a bridesmaid dress for an upcoming wedding. Today, this ad appeared in my News Feed:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.   The image gives me a good idea of what to expect from the designer's website, and it definitely helps that the gowns are both unique and stunning. Talk about a showstopper.  It's relevant.  The ad called out that I was already shopping for bridesmaid dresses, and what's more, I had previously looked at dresses on this exact website, so this ad is highly relevant to my search. It's valuable.  The variety of dresses in the ad's image and in the description make this website worth a visit for someone trying to find the perfect gown out of thousands of options. It has a clear call-to-action.  The CTA is \"Shop Now,\" which encourages me to click to purchase the beautiful dresses in the ad's image. 8) The Boosted Post A boosted post is an organic Facebook post that was originally on the homepage of a company’s Facebook, and that later was boosted with advertising money.\nThis is different from the above ads because it's not created in the Facebook Ads Manager. You can include more in the description, as there is no limit to word count on boosted posts like there is in ads. You can also have a link in the copy.\nThe cons? Boosted posts leave you fewer options for bidding, targeting, and pricing. You also cannot run any types of A/B tests because you're promoting a post that's already been creating, not creating one from scratch.\nHere's an example of a boosted post from Bustle, who promoted one of its articles on Facebook:\n\nWhy this works: It's visual.  Lots of people are familiar with the Amazon Prime logo, but not in neon lights in a window display. It made me do a double-take while scrolling through Facebook. It's relevant.  As we've already learned from earlier examples, I like shopping on Amazon and also read Bustle, so this article is a combination of those two behaviors. It's valuable.  \"Brilliant\" is a strong adjective to describe products, which makes me curious to learn more about purchasing them. It has a clear call-to-action.  The ad entices me with information about useful and \"brilliant\" gadgets I can get delivered to my door within two days, which I'm happy to click to learn more about. Getting Started There you have it: A list of all the different types of Facebook posts and a few examples of awesome ones from all different brands.

      "text": "Everyone Can Finally Watch Netflix Offline By Facebook At last, Netflix is giving the people what they want (but not a good season of Arrested Development ). \nEarlier today, without warning, Netflix dropped one of its coolest, most anticipated features ever: Offline Mode. In typical new-media fashion, this announcement came in the form of a smug little tweet. \nhttps://twitter.com/netflix/status/803962377997688832 \nThe official website was updated shortly thereafter to give us some more information: Starting today, users on iOS and Android phones/tablets can, on certain movies and shows, download videos to watch later without an internet connection. As long as you have an account, and the latest version of the app, that's all you need. \nThis is something Netflix users have been asking for for many years now. The company has never exactly been fast to address its fans (except that one time they tried to stop doing DVDs altogether, remember that disaster? ). In fact, just two years ago the higher-ups at Netflix said the ability to download content would never happen. \nSo far, it looks like you can only download Netflix Original shows/movies, along with some selected other stuff (there's no official list running around just yet.) But Netflix promised there are \"more on the way\" so your sick, sick dream of watching American Pie Presents: The Book Of Love on a crowded bus could still become a reality.

      "text": "Follow KRLD: Facebook | Twitter \nDALLAS (KRLD) – Jesse Puente is a heating and air conditioning technician in Dallas. He just returned from a trip to North Dakota, where protesters have clashed for months with police over Dallas-based Energy Transfer Partners’ proposed Dakota Access Pipeline. Puente says he’ll pick up supplies today and return to the protest site tomorrow. \n“I’m worried about them freezing for the winter. I’m so worried about them surviving. My main objective is to make sure that everybody that’s going in there, comes out O.K.” \nTemperatures at the protest site are below freezing. Several Native American tribes are part of the effort to block the pipeline, including a group from the nearby Standing Rock Sioux Reservation. They claim the pipeline is a danger to drinking water sources, and would go through sacred tribal burial grounds. \nNorth Dakota’s Governor has ordered mandatory evacuation of the protesters by next Monday. The Army Corps of Engineers will block all access to the area, but does not plan on forcible removal of the protesters. \n(©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Margot Gerster / Facebook screenshot If you want to become more creative, happier and a better problem solver — and do it all without spending a dime — you’re #WithHer.\nFollowing her presidential election defeat, Hillary Clinton has been spotted hiking near her Chappaqua, N.Y., home. Photographs were snapped and shared, social media went bonkers and some people are now hiking in the area for the sole purpose of snapping a selfie with HRC.\nFor Clinton, stomping around in the woods may be more than just a way to get some exercise (and her photo taken), as its benefits go beyond just the calorie burn you get from a jog on the treadmill.\nShe’s getting out her anxiety and anger\nA hike in the woods may be just what Clinton needs to boost her mood after her election upset: A June 2015 study published in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning found that people who took a 50-minute walk in nature had decreased levels of anxiety and higher levels of happiness than those who took a walk through an urban area for 50 minutes. What’s more, exposure to nature “reduces mental fatigue and the feelings of irritability that come with it,” according to a study published in Environment & Behavior, a journal that examines relationships between people’s behavior and their environments.\nCan Wall Street close this gender gap? (2:27) Women have only half the retirement savings of men, even though they control $5 trillion in investable assets. Can Wall Street get women to invest more?\nShe’s boosting her creative and problem-solving skills\nFrom how much to be involved in the recount process to figuring out what to do next, Clinton has many issues in her life that need resolving. Hiking can help: It increases performance on creative tasks and problem-solving tasks by 50%, according to a study published in the Public Library of Science in 2012 . Part of the reason is that “higher-order cognitive skills improve with sustained exposure to a natural environment,” the researchers write.\nShe’s improving her mental health\nClinton has likely played (and replayed!) the events of her campaign over and over in her mind, searching for where it went awry. Hiking may help her stop that process: A study published in July 2015, which compared the mental health of those who walked for 90 minutes in nature vs. those who walked for the same amount of time near a road, found that people who hiked in nature had lower levels of rumination, in which you engage in repetitive thoughts focused on negative things. The nature hikers also “showed reduced neural activity in an area of the brain linked to risk for mental illness,” according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .\nS he’s sharpening her memory\nThe study published in the journal Landscape and Urban Planning found that nature walkers increased their ability to remember things. Specifically, it showed that people who walk in nature have better working memory — which helps you remember things while you’re in the middle of doing something.\nMore from MarketWatch Aging is not a barrier to working longer Couples who have better sex do this 5 huge real-estate trends to watch in 2017 Related Topics Futures Commodities Markets Commodity Futures Trading Commission",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) — Kellogg says it will no longer advertise on Breitbart.com , the website formerly run by one of President-elect Donald Trump’s top aides, Steve Bannon. \nKellogg Co. spokeswoman Kris Charles says the food company regularly works with media buyers to ensure its ads “do not appear on sites that aren’t aligned with our values as a company.” She says “occasionally something is inadvertently missed,” and Kellogg decided to “discontinue” advertising on Breitbart after learning its ads were on the site. \nBreitbart is the target of a concerted effort on social media that calls on companies to cease advertising on the site, which has been condemned as racist, sexist and anti-Semitic. \nThe site called Kellogg’s decision “economic censorship” and “un-American,” saying Kellogg was denigrating “to its own detriment” the consumers who elected Trump. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "C M Handler via Wikimedia Commons // CC BY-SA 3.0 Like us on Facebook \nIf you think construction noise is a nap-destroying nuisance, you should check out the space rock that hit a sleeping woman on this day in 1954. \nAnn Hodges had settled onto the couch that afternoon with no awareness of the agent of chaos tearing through the heavens above her house. A larger-than-average meteorite was zipping toward our planet, crumbling as it fell. The fireball produced by the meteorite’s disintegration was so bright it could be seen by humans below in three different states. Most of the rock’s bulk was vaporized as it entered Earth’s atmosphere, but one bowling-ball-sized chunk survived and continued on its improbable course. \nThe scorching-hot rock crashed through the roof of Hodges’s home in Sylacauga , Alabama , then through her ceiling into her living room, bouncing off a large radio before slamming into her unconscious body. Astonishingly, 34-year-old Hodges survived the incident with minor injuries, including a heinous bruise on her waist. But the meteorite’s violent arrival was just the start. \nEveryone wanted a piece of the space-struck housewife—Hodges made appearances in newspapers, LIFE magazine, and on TV game shows—but they also wanted a piece of the rock that struck her. Air Force intelligence seized the rock to make sure it wasn’t some sort of spy equipment. Geologists at the Smithsonian wanted to keep it for further study. Ann’s husband Hewlett saw the meteorite as a gold mine and decided to sell it. \nUnfortunately, their landlord Bertie Guy had the same idea. The two took it to court, where Guy argued that any celestial object that fell on her property automatically belonged to her. The case became a battle of endurance. Eventually, the landlord lost, but not before the drawn-out legal process drove down the meteorite’s value. By the time the rock reverted to Ann and Hewlett's possession, nobody wanted to buy it. Ann began using it as a doorstop, and eventually donated it to the Alabama Museum of Natural History. \nThe trauma of the incident, legal battles, and overwhelming media attention left their scars on Hodges long after her bruise had healed. She and her husband separated, citing the strain caused by the meteorite and saying they wished it had never happened. Ann fell ill and died just eight years later at the age of 52. \nHodges’s brush with space was, oddly enough, not the beginning nor the end of her home state’s relationship with meteorites. The jazz standard “Stars Fell on Alabama” was penned 20 years earlier in praise of an especially spectacular meteor shower. Six decades later, another meteorite rained debris not too far from the couple’s old home. If this story has a moral, it’s for Alabama residents: Please keep an eye on the sky.

      "text": "Like us on Facebook \nby Becca Stanek \nPolice are searching for a man who swiped $1.6 million worth of gold flakes—and then made a very, very slow escape. The heist happened on September 29, in the middle of the day in Midtown Manhattan. Surveillance video shows a man slowly approaching a momentarily unattended armored truck and grabbing a large bucket off the back of it. The New York Times reported the man \"probably doesn't know what was in [the bucket]\" when he steals it—but as it turned out, he struck gold. The metal bucket was filled with 86 pounds of gold flakes. \nOf course, the tremendous weight of the bucket proved problematic for executing a speedy getaway. Video indicated it took the man over an hour to lug the bucket half a mile through the streets of Manhattan, and he had to stop to \"catch his breath\" at one point, setting the bucket down on the sidewalk, The New York Times reported. \nBut apparently, slow and steady really does win the race, because the man managed to get away. Police are still searching for the thief, who they described as \"a Hispanic male who is about 5-feet-6-inches tall, 150 pounds, and between 50 and 60 years old.\" The gold flakes are still missing. \nAlso from The Week :",

      "text": "Kimberly White | Getty Images Sheryl Sandberg Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg has transferred roughly $100 million in Facebook stock into a fund specifically intended for charitable donations, according to a Securities and Exchange Commission document filed Wednesday. \nThe stock, 880,000 shares, was transferred into what is known as a donor advised fund, which is controlled in this case by Fidelity, but gives Sandberg the chance to steer the money where she wants it. \nThat includes women's empowerment groups like Lean In (which Sandberg founded), anti-poverty organizations like Second Harvest Food Bank, and grief organizations like Kara , according to people familiar with Sandberg's plans. \nMore from Recode: \nMossberg: All the Walt that's fit to print \nHey Amazon, we're still getting used to voice-first devices — please don't give Echo a screen \nTrump's pick for transportation secretary could be good for companies with self-driving ambitions \nSandberg has also filed paperwork to rename her current foundation the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Foundation after her late husband and a beloved Silicon Valley entrepreneur who died unexpectedly about 18 months ago. \nThat non-profit foundation will serve as an umbrella organization for both LeanIn.org and a new organization Sandberg is starting called OptionB.org, intended to help people cope with loss and hardship. (Sandberg is also writing a book under the same name, \"Option B,\" which will come out next spring and is being published by Random House.) \nSome of the $100 million donation will be used to help fund both LeanIn and OptionB. \nThis is not Sandberg's first big philanthropic push, though it is her largest. Last year she set aside $31 million in Facebook stock for similar causes, and has signed The Giving Pledge , a commitment to give away more than half of her wealth during her lifetime. \nForbes pegs Sandberg's net worth at $1.37 billion. \n— By Kurt Wagner, Recode.net . \n\nCNBC's parent NBCUniversal is an investor in Recode's parent Vox, and the companies have a content-sharing arrangement.",

      "text": "Getty Images Like us on Facebook \nWe’ve all chewed Juicy Fruit gum at some point, enjoying the sweetness for about 20 seconds before it completely dissipates and turns into a rubbery wad devoid of all flavor. \nBut what exactly is that distinctively delicious flavor that briefly tickles our taste buds? Wrigley has kept the secret ingredient under wraps for decades; a wrapper from 1946 describes the unique taste as “ a fascinating artificial flavor .” \nOne fan allegedly emailed the company in 2002 and got this response : \n“I'm afraid we can't be very specific because, for competitive reasons, we consider our Juicy Fruit flavoring formula to be a trade secret. I can, however, tell you that the mixture of fruit flavors in Juicy Fruit is comprised of predominately lemon, orange, pineapple, and banana notes.” \nDespite the company’s response, some people think the gum tastes less like common citrus and banana, and more like an exotic fruit called jackfruit; it even has a similar aroma . However, this probably isn’t the case because, as Today I Found Out points out , there don’t seem to be any records of Wrigley ever importing the fruit or its juice. \nInstead of actual fruit or even fruit extracts, some chemists believe that the gum smells like jackfruit because they both contain a chemical called isoamyl acetate. Isoamyl acetate, sometimes referred to as banana oil or essence of pear, is a common ingredient in bubble gum, and some fruits produce it naturally as they ripen. \nWhen Juicy Fruit first appeared on store shelves back in 1893, isoamyl acetate was most commonly produced by whiskey distilleries as a byproduct—and at the time, Illinois, also home to Wrigley, produced more than 18 million gallons of the hard stuff every year. Smells Like Science speculates that Wrigley purchased isoamyl acetate from local distilleries until a synthetic process became available some years later. \nMuch like the Colonel's 11 secret herbs and spices, or Coke's \"7x\" flavoring, we may never know what, exactly, is in Juicy Fruit gum. But there is one thing we do know: it's delicious—for 20 seconds. \nHave you got a Big Question you'd like us to answer? If so, let us know by emailing us at . More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Social media and the American election Where polling failed, Facebook prevailed Nov 30th 2016, 15:48 Tweet \nNO ONE, not even the man himself, expected Donald Trump to triumph on election night. There was some disagreement about how much of an underdog he was: the forecasting models most bullish on his chances gave him slightly less than a 30% shot—the same number his campaign’s data wonks had—while the most sceptical ones estimated a mere 2%. Betting markets roughly split the difference, assigning him a 20% chance of victory. But given Hillary Clinton’s imposing leads in both national and state polls, no prediction based on public surveys could have considered Mr Trump a favourite. Some of Mrs Clinton’s campaign staffers were so certain of her victory that they began popping champagne hours before the votes were counted. \nIt is now clear that many of these polls, particularly at the state level, were gravely off the mark. The American Association for Public Opinion Research has promised an autopsy by May of next year. Until then at least, the cause—whether “shy Trumpers” ashamed to admit their allegiances, erroneous turnout projections or faulty sampling methods—will remain uncertain. \nGiven this disappointing performance, sheepish prognosticators have wondered whether any alternate source of information might have offset the off-target polling. Preliminary evidence suggests that one may have been sitting on their monitors all along: interest and enthusiasm on social media. In general, the projected vote shares in each state published by FiveThirtyEight, the most prominent electoral-forecasting site, were fairly accurate. However, their few misses—primarily concentrated in the Rust Belt—turned out to be decisive. And it was precisely in those states where Mr Trump enjoyed some of his greatest online advantages. \nIn order to help advertisers target their consumers, Facebook maintains a platform that estimates its users’ interest in a wide range of topics. Shortly before the election, Erin Pettigrew, a media consultant, obtained figures from Facebook gauging interest in both Mr Trump and Mrs Clinton in each state. The day after the election, she published an article demonstrating that these numbers broadly lined up with the two candidates’ ultimate vote totals. Although Mr Trump enjoyed the lion’s share of Facebook interest in every single state—his worst performance was in the District of Columbia, where he only carried two-thirds of the conversation—his advantages tended to be greater in states that wound up voting for him. \nIt is possible that these statistics could simply have reflected patterns that had already been observed in polls. However, it turns out that Mr Trump’s performance on Facebook provided tantalising clues as to where the public surveys were likely to misfire. For example, he scored an unexpected victory in Michigan, where he faced a four-percentage-point deficit and interest was 18th highest in the country. By contrast, Mrs Clinton enjoyed a similar polling lead in Colorado, but the state ranked 43rd in interest in her opponent. She went on to win it comfortably. \nWith the benefit of hindsight, a time-travelling statistician could have used the social-media numbers to produce deadly accurate forecasts. Combining data from polls, Facebook, and Google searches, he could have correctly predicted 49 of the 50 states, missing only Wisconsin. That would have been enough to foresee a defeat for Mrs Clinton. (For quantitatively-minded readers, polling averages and Facebook interest were both statistically significant, while Google searches were not.) Given that time travel is yet to be invented, there is no way to know whether this relationship will persist in future elections. Nonetheless, the strong association shows that forecasters would be well-advised to try to incorporate “digital enthusiasm”, however measured, into their models. \nThese data are silent on why Facebook interest seems to have provided such a valuable complement to polling. But one plausible explanation would be that superior social-media performance reflects higher enthusiasm for a candidate, which in turn correlates well with turnout. Forecasting turnout is notoriously difficult—just 60% of the electorate votes, but over 90% of poll respondents say they will definitely vote when asked. As a result, pollsters rely on estimates pegged to the previous election, making it hard to anticipate changes. As the pool of internet users expands beyond the young and cosmopolitan, the web is increasingly representative of the overall electorate. Paradoxically, pollsters may have to dive into seemingly chaotic streams of internet chatter to produce more reliable barometers in the future. ",

      "text": "Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin with a post on her public Facebook account appeared Wednesday to confirm a report that she’s under consideration by President-elect Donald Trump to become secretary of the Department of Veterans Affairs.\nThe post included a highly stylized video produced by SARAHPAC, her political action committee, about the former vice presidential candidate’s ideas on how to fix the troubled agency, and a link to the ABC news report that first broke the news of her vetting by the Trump transition team. ABC said that both a Palin aide and the Trump transition team confirmed she’s under consideration to run the VA.\n“We should be grateful we’ll soon have a commander-in-chief who will champion our vets and honor the promises our nation made; a pro-private sector individual who surely understands bigger government is NOT the answer; a President who promised to drain the swamp and clean up all government corruption … all things our vets and active duty troops deserve,” Palin wrote, followed by an American flag emoji.\nPalin, who unsuccessfully ran on a ticket with Sen. John McCain , R-Ariz., in 2008, would take the helm of an agency marked by scandal and crisis. The VA also stands at a policy crossroads, with many lawmakers in favor of allowing veterans to more widely use private doctors and hospitals, a plan vehemently opposed by many Democrats and some veterans groups. In 2014, lawmakers scrambled to expand access to VA health care when it was discovered that some veterans seeking care were waiting so long that they died before seeing a doctor.\nPalin, who is known for her brash speaking style, if tapped and confirmed would also inherit a position in which current VA Secretary Robert McDonald received considerable blowback for a public statement made about wait times. McDonald was excoriated by lawmakers and advocacy groups for comparing VA wait times to lines at a Disney theme park.\nPalin’s video lays out three major platforms for what she wants to see from federal veterans’ care: allow veterans to receive care in the private market through vouchers, allow veterans re-entering the civilian workforce to use military certifications in place of civilian ones for job skills, and maintain veterans’ retirement benefits.\nThose changes won’t come without a price. For example, lawmakers are currently grappling with how to extend a $10 billion private care program that expires in August 2017 or whenever the money allocated to it runs out. Recently, CQ reported that the program, while designed to provide a new route of access for patients facing distance issues or long wait times, was mostly serving veterans who couldn’t get the care they wanted at a VA facility. That’s triggered questions about whether the program is being administered in the way it was intended.\nThere’s also a slew of concerns from House authorizers about the way the VA is spending money on a construction project in Denver and reports of lavish art purchases at medical facilities — issues which were the subject of a federal subpoena issued by House lawmakers in September.",

Smith told reporters at a news conference near the Stop 1 Convenience Store in the Windsor Hills neighborhood that a lone gunman fired on people standing in front of the store at about 6 p.m., Fox 45 Baltimore reported. \nSON ACCUSED OF KILLING, DISMEMBERING PARENTS DURING THANKSGIVING VISIT \nSmith said that one man was pronounced dead at the scene, while a second was pronounced dead at a hospital. \nA third man was critically wounded, and a fourth man and two women had non-life-threatening injuries, officials said. \nSmith said that detectives believe the shooting was retaliation for a homicide in the area several days ago. \n\"We do believe that this incident is connected possibly to an earlier incident,\" Smith told reporters. \nThe shooter fled on foot from the scene. \nOfficers have a limited description of the suspect and are asking witnesses to come forward, according to Smith. \n\"You need to get him before these streets get him and we have to knock on your door,\" he told Fox 45. \nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.

      "text": "\nSalima Hafeez took to Facebook to ask for help in finding the suspects who brutally attacked Salima’s 15-year-old nephew, a Canadian teenager of Pakistani Muslim background. Salima’s nephew Noah Rabbani was reportedly walking home from a friend’s house on Sunday, November 27, 2016, when two white men attacked him, beat him severely with a baseball bat and then stole his backpack.\nThe family and community complained that Noah’s story had not gotten any media attention. Hafeez says that race-related attacks are on the rise in Canada and that many are going completely unreported by the Canadian media.\nHey @CBCNews since you are tax$ funded. Why not do a poll on racism in Canada. Its endemic, not reported. pic.twitter.com/5dqPmlXLCH \n— Human (@Justiceisall) December 8, 2015 \n\n“What are we as a community going to do about it,” Hafeez asks on a Facebook post that has been shared over 1,300 times as of Wednesday evening. “What are our politicians going to do about it?”\n“Our family is asking for your help. We want you to share this message so that the attackers can be caught as soon as possible (details below). We want you to share this message so that our communities start talking about racism and Islamophobia which appear to be on the rise.

Their headline called it a robbery.\n“On Sunday November 27, 2016 just shortly after 4:00pm, Hamilton Police officers responded to investigate a robbery.\n“During the early morning hours of midnight on Sunday November 27th, 2016, a 15 year old boy was walking in the area of Rymal Road East and Fletcher Road, where he was assaulted and robbed of his backpack.\n“It was reported that a car drove up alongside of him and stopped. Two males were then seen exiting the car with one of the males holding a baseball bat. The males approached the boy and struck him with the bat several times causing serious injuries. The suspects ran back to the car and left in an unknown direction.\n“The victim was transported to the hospital by paramedics, where he is recovering from serious injuries.”\nNews Release – Detectives are investigating a robbery in the area of Rymal Road East and Fletcher Road. https://t.co/rkrST2SyNj #HamOnt pic.twitter.com/73PZ5VKyVS \n— Hamilton Police (@HamiltonPolice) November 29, 2016 \n\nThe Hamilton Police say that the first suspect is described a white man who is about five foot six inches tall with a thin build.

That report says that Noah ended up in intensive care facing surgery to remove a blood clot on his brain. Noah does not have full movement on the right side of his body. The CBC report did mention the possibility that the brutal beating may have been a hate crime.\nHuma Aslam, an aunt of Noah’s, said there was nothing of real value in Noah’s backpack at the time of the robbery and assault. She says that he is a “quiet, kind boy and an exceptional student who has won several academic awards.”\nHamilton Police Const. Asuf Khokhar told a journalist that detectives are “looking at all aspects.” Noah reportedly is still unable to speak much, due to injuries to his brain and jaw. He also suffered injuries to his limbs and spine. After he was beaten, he managed to make it a few doors down to his grandmother’s house.\n[Featured Image by Salima Hafeez/ Facebook ]\nPolice Report Brutal Beating Of Canadian Muslim Teen As ‘A Robbery,’ But Family Suspects Noah Rabbani Was The Victim Of A Hate Crime is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:12 AM December 01, 2016 \nTwo mornings ago, I opened Facebook to a few posts recounting a recent incident about an actor (who shall remain nameless here) who allegedly grievously disrespected a coactor in a scene. \nThe coactor was bound and gagged, unable to move, and, as his character, is begging for his life as outlined in the script. There are three other actors present playing smaller parts, as well, plus the director and crew manning their stations. \nSo far, everything is going according to what’s written, until the immobilized actor hears his scene partner unzipping his trousers, anxious about what could happen next. And then, the unthinkable happens. ADVERTISEMENT \nNeedless to say, after the director yells, “Cut,” the now freed-from-his-binds actor, soaked from head to toe in urine, is livid. He punches a steel cargo container wall, injuring his hand (thankfully, surgery will not be required), and hurls all sorts of invectives at the offending party. He retained enough professionalism to finish the scene, struggling to remain in character through it all, but that stopped the moment the tape over his mouth was removed. \nAs an actor, hearing about incidents like this is beyond infuriating. It is an egregious violation of that thing that governs the actions of all arts practitioners and those who work alongside them: Respect. \nRehearsal rooms and film sets are supposed to be safe spaces for us to work in. In these rooms, we are at our most vulnerable, our emotions laid bare. That space is considered sacred. \nThat’s how we are able to do our best work, knowing that we all, without exception, have each other’s backs. There is support from everyone involved: actor, director, scriptwriter, cameraman, crew member, assistants and staff. And it doesn’t matter how old you are; you are expected to know this. Even if you happen to be 11 years old. \nThe offending actor has the unenviable reputation of reportedly showing up intoxicated on film sets. Rehearsals with him are unpredictable, or just plain unproductive. Producers have allegedly given him many chances to clean up his act, but it seems his luck might have run out for good after this latest untoward incident. As the director of the film has pointed out on her Facebook page, his character has been killed off, and her movie will do just fine without him. \nNo one is ever above this cardinal rule of working in the arts, show business or any other industry on earth. Respect your coworkers, and you will receive respect. Find below a few specific ways to practice this: \nWhen a very quiet scene is being rehearsed or shot, make sure there’s nothing on your person that could make noise. Put your cell phone on silent mode, or turn it off completely. If you need to have a piece of candy, unwrap it beforehand or wait until after the scene is done. The author with Simon Bowman onstage at the 25th anniversary gala of “Miss Saigon” \nAssure your costar (especially if you’re in a romantic partnership onscreen or onstage) that you are worthy of his/her trust. Here’s a story: When I was 18 years old working on “Miss Saigon,” upon finding out that I would have to be in very romantic, passionate clinches with my costar Simon Bowman, both my mother and I were petrified. Simon very sweetly spoke to us separately, saying that we could absolutely trust him, that he would never ever use the scenes to take advantage of me. He was true to his word from the very first rehearsal until the very last time we performed Kim and Chris together. \nSupport and respect your fellow actors. Each of them has a different process preparing for or performing a role. At the end of one rehearsal of “Fun Home” in Manila, director Bobby Garcia told the kids in the show that all the grownups have a different process, so they were expressly told to not make us kulit (pester us) until we gave them permission. And they did just that. \nShow up early, and prepared. This needs no further explanation. \nHave empathy for everyone you’re working with. Place yourself in their shoes. We don’t always know what’s going on in their lives. One actor got gravely ill while working on a musical, but still managed to show up for performances despite this. The disease manifested itself as acne that broke out everywhere. Another actor in the same show was being judgmental without first finding out what was wrong, thinking it might’ve been communicable. Fair enough, but wouldn’t a “Hey there, are you OK?” have been a much better way to approach this, thus eliminating subsequent misunderstanding? \nRespect the casting decision of the director, even if you disagree with it. While working in a show, one actor I know would receive the most vile text messages the moment she would exit a scene and return backstage. She suspected that the unfortunate timing meant that it was coming from someone in the show working with her who might’ve been her competition during the casting process. \nKeep the workplace as peaceful as possible. It doesn’t have to be tomb silent, but one should look forward to going there because of the wonderful camaraderie and friendships formed. I’ve worked in shows where, one or two floors above me, doors would be loudly slammed when coworkers didn’t like each other, goodbye cards ripped apart, animosity while onstage. To be clear, no one is required to like one another. In truth, that is a bonus and doesn’t always happen. But to respect one another is an absolute must. This is inviolable.",

      "title": "The 4 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of Facebook or Amazon for 2017",
      "text": "The weeks before Thanksgiving brought a cornucopia of good news to tech investor Paul Wick. Five compan ies he owned in the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund were acquired in rapid succession as an M&A wave swept the semiconductor industry--a slice of the technology sector to which Wick has dedicated nearly half of his $4.4 billion fund. Meanwhile, shares in the Silicon Valley-based portfolio manager's biggest holding, LAM Research, hit an all-time high. \"Yet there's still considerable upside,\" says Wick. \"We're more bullish about the semi-conductor industry than we are about software or the Internet sector. \"\nTechnology, though one of the most profitable and fastest-growing S&P 500 sectors, also tends to be relatively expensive. And investors are jittery about how President Trump's policies might -affect some of the largest players: After Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , Netflix nflx , and Google googl sold off in the wake of the election, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach advised investors \"to stay away from these things in a big way.\" But investors like Wick are finding exceptions to that -sentiment--particularly in less glamorous but no less important corners of the industry.\nThough it might seem imprudent to recommend a stock that's already risen 35% this year, LAM Research lrcx still trades at 13 times its 2017 estimated earnings. That means the stock trades at a 21% discount to the S&P 500 and is 18% cheaper than the technology sector. (For what it's worth, LAM's run pales beside that of the S&P 500's best-performing stock in the first 11 months of 2016, the chipmaker Nvidia nvda , whose stock has almost tripled.) \nLAM doesn't make the chips themselves, but rather equipment that companies like Samsung (one of its largest customers) use to put \"flash\" memory into semiconductors that are used in everything from iPhones to fitness trackers to Tesla tsla cars. Flash memory--so called because it processes data faster and with less heat than traditional hard disk drives--has become essential in enabling companies like Apple aapl to make its MacBooks more powerful and smaller at the same time, while allowing companies like Amazon and Spotify to retrieve music from their massive cloud libraries instantaneously.\nHistorically, LAM's stock has traded at a discount because its earnings \"tend to have a lot of wiggle,\" fluctuating depending on electronics' product cycles, says USAA's head of equities John Toohey, who is also a fan of the stock. But for the past three years LAM has grown consistently, increasing sales at a rate of 18% annually and averaging earnings growth of 56%. Wick expects that robust growth to continue in 2017, as the accelerating pace of innovation keeps semiconductor foundries buzzing: \"There is no such thing as a semiconductor cycle anymore,\" he says. Plus, LAM pays a dividend yielding nearly 2%--and with almost two-thirds of its cash offshore, it could benefit from a potential tax-repatriation holiday in the U.S. \n\nAs the number of devices connected to the Internet has expanded, so has concern over how to keep that data safe. Spending on cybersecurity equipment, including firewalls, was on pace to grow about 13% in 2016, to $10.6 billion, Gartner says, but that rate is expected to slow to 8% over the next few years. Still, Palo Alto Networks panw , which makes state-of-the-art security systems known as next-generation firewalls, is growing its sales about four times as fast. \"They're really on the cutting edge to help people protect their infrastructure,\" says Margaret Vitrano, portfolio manager of the $4 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund. Although ups and downs in businesses' cybersecurity spending can mean volatility for Palo Alto's earnings and its stock, the company expects to grow revenue 31% next fiscal year, making its 2017 estimated P/E of 49 look fairly reasonable. \nElsewhere in cybersecurity, Wick likes Check Point Software Technologies chkp , a cheaper option (a P/E of 17). Founded in Israel in the pre-dotcom-boom 1990s, Check Point has proved to be \"much more shareholder-friendly\" than some of its younger peers and social media companies, Wick says; the company has bought back stock from shareholders for 13 straight years through 2016. \nOther investors are rethinking what it means to be a tech stock--finding opportunities in other industries where companies are using technology to make over their business models. Henry Ellenbogen, who manages the $16.3 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, points to Vail Resorts mtn . Once just an elite place to ski in Colorado, Vail has adopted a subscription model for lift tickets the way Salesforce crm has done for software and startup ClassPass has done for yoga and spinning classes: Think of it as a season's pass with unlimited access to 13 different mountains in six states, Canada, and Australia. The company offers an app and harnesses its data to make chairlift lines more efficient--one reliable way to keep customers coming back. And Vail has been regularly acquiring new property and tucking it into its network, giving the company a scale that has helped Vail generate returns on capital unprecedented for its industry. The stock trades at a 2017 P/E ratio of 31, but Ellenbogen expects Vail to grow earnings organically 10% to 13% next year.\nPICKS: \nLAM Research lrcx \nPalo Alto Networks panw \nCheck Point Software Technologies chkp \nVail Resorts mtn \nThis is part of Fortune's 2017 Investor's Guide feature, \" The 21 Best Stocks to Buy Before Donald Trump Becomes President .” For the rest of the picks (including two funds) in other sectors, click on the links below: \nThe 5 Best Gold and Energy Stocks for 2017 The 3 Best Health Care Stocks for 2017 The 4 Best Brexit-Proof Stocks for 2017 The 3 Best Emerging Market Picks for 2017 The 4 Best Financial and Industrial Stocks for 2017 A version of this article appears in the December 15, 2016 issue of Fortune with the headline “Stocks to Keep a Nest Egg Growing.” ",

Credit: Facebook/Metropolitan Police \nA man wanted by police on suspicion of moped thefts has taunted them on their own Facebook appeal. \nWandsworth Police appealed for information on the whereabouts of Nathan Bick, 18, described as a \"prolific motor vehicle thief\". \n\"He is known to favour stealing mopeds and often uses them to commit other crimes,\" the appeal said. \nBut the suspect, thought to be a new father to a three-month-old girl, taunted police by commenting: \"Just keep up if you can.\" \nSorry, this content isn't available on your device. \nHe also responded to one Facebook user who informed police of the estates in the borough that he is known to frequent. \nHe wrote: \"Hopefully I see you two [sic] love.\" \nResponding to his taunts, Wandsworth Police wrote: \"Might as well hand yourself in now, Nathan.\" \nIn another comment, the police wrote: \"You can give us a call on the number on the appeal above, which has been seen by 50,000 people. \n\"And don't worry about transportation, we can arrange that.\" Last updated Thu 1 Dec 2016 ",

Joaquin Candela/Facebook \n\"We need everybody to contribute to artificial intelligence,\" Joaquin Quiñonero Candela, the head of Facebook's Applied Machine Learning (AML) research division, tells Business Insider. \nCandela is speaking about Facebook itself, sure, as the social network is racing against the other major tech titans to hire as many artificial intelligence and machine learning experts as it can all over the world , even as it makes AI crucial to the way it builds products and does business. \nBut he's also speaking broadly: As Facebook , Google , Microsoft and even Elon Musk make big bets that artificial intelligence is integral to the future of computing, there literally aren't enough experts with the right skills available to hire . \n\"You can't hire enough people who are machine learning experts in the world,\" says Candela. \nSo Facebook wants to create more AI experts. \nThe company has a new outreach campaign that explains how artificial intelligence is neither scary nor incomprehensible — it's just another tool in the programmers' toolbelt that can help them build \"new experiences,\" and a set of skills that are going to be incredibly valuable in the future. \nHere's a new Facebook video, starring Facebook AI chief Yann Lecun, that tries to explain in simple terms how scary-sounding terms like \"deep learning\" are really just math: \nFrom Candela's perspective, this is a small part of a necessary larger outreach to the next generation of programmers. \nIn the same way that people 15 to 20 years ago ended up wishing that they had studied computer science more closely in school once the PC revolution was underway, he says, it's \"quite obvious\" that 10 years from now, lots of people, programmers included, are going to wish they studied artificial intelligence. So if you want to work for Facebook, it's definitely the right field to study. \n\"There's just a gap,\" Candela says.

      "text": "Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Comments MEN are spending so much time pleasuring themselves in front of internet porn that they are failing to learn how to please a lady. \nThat’s the warning from psychologists who are worried about the dismal sexual performance of the male members of Generation Snowflake . Getty Images 3 Porn can cause men’s sexual prowess to wither like a plucked flower \nDr Andrew Smiler, a “masculinity expert”, claimed that up to one in ten young men are now suffering from erectile dysfunction caused by porn addiction. \nSmiler’s research is nothing to grin about, sketching a portrait of doomed young boys suffering the sort of penis problems normally associated with old men. \n“The guys I see, most of them are between 13 and 25,” he told The Independent. Getty Images Men are advised to take a porn holiday to ‘reboot’ their kinked out sex drive \n“The vast majority are, for the most part, the picture of physical health.” \nThese boys spend so many hours in front of porn that they find it difficult to perform in real life. \n“In porn, sex always happens very easily, everybody has a great time and nobody ever refuses or says ‘i don’t want to do that’,” he added. \n“But in reality, people aren’t always in the mood. \n“Guys go in expecting it to all be easy and they don’t know what to do,” \nHe said there was nothing wrong with a little solitary bump and grind from time to time, but self-pleasuring becomes a problem when it takes place several times a day. \nDr Angela Gregory, a sex therapist at Nottingham University Hospital, added: “Men are becoming both physically and psychologically desensitised to normal sexual stimulation and arousal with a sexual partner.” Getty Images Real romance can sometimes fail to satisfy the porn-primed appetites of smut addicts Related Stories Could the military save civilians from hurricanes by blasting the storm with a NUCLEAR BOMB?

Porn star couple watch and comment on each other having sex at work fo \nOur sex and relationship columnist Dr Pam Spurr said researchers have noticed a \"huge increase in younger men who use porn regularly and can’t get an erection when with a partner\". \nShe wrote: \"They’ve become so used to masturbating to porn they find it hard to relate to a partner. Or because they’re used to the excitement of porn films they don’t get aroused by ‘ordinary’ sex. \n\"The fantasy sex in porn is what they expect now. They need all that fakery – the physically enhanced bodies, the fantasy scenarios, the XXX-rated kinky things some porn stars do. \n\"Traditionally erectile dysfunction (ED) has pretty much struck younger men due to excess alcohol – classic ‘brewer’s droop’ – or occasionally through nerves.

      "text": "December 1 at 2:00 PM Follow @AlyssaRosenberg\nThe Facebook logo is displayed on an iPad in Philadelphia. (Matt Rourke/Associated Press) One of the hottest questions in the aftermath of the 2016 election has been how to fight the plague of fake news. Facebook has alternately evaded and grappled with its role in the crisis. Fake-news writers have explained their motivations . And my colleague David Ignatius has looked at the international implications of a wave of falsehoods .\nAs much as it’s important to push back on what’s not true, it’s also important to focus on what is trustworthy and to explain why outlets and reporters who continually do a good job amidst this onslaught are worth trusting. After this disorienting election, I reached out to a wide range of friends from all points on the political spectrum to ask what outlets and which writers they had confidence in and to explain the reasons for that confidence.\nMany of the people who responded suggested that they trusted individual writers — or the judgment of individual people passing along stories — more than the trusted specific institutions.\n“This will be unsatisfying, but I (increasingly) don’t trust organizations or outlets; I trust individual journalists and opinion leaders. This is partly because I think it’s harder [nowadays] for outlets to impose quality control, editing, fact checking, etc., and partly because Twitter is a primary means of consuming information,” wrote the Daily Caller’s Matt Lewis. “This is not to say that some outlets aren’t dramatically more trustworthy than others, but the brand name that I tend to trust is the one on the byline, not the masthead.”\n“I’ve found myself gravitating to specific, individual trusted voices, not just as sources but as curators of other sources — e.g., trusted filters: [The Washington Post]’s own Dave Fahrenthold, Greg Sargent and Dave Weigel come to mind, as do MSNBC’s Joy Reid, CBS (and now [the New York Times’]) Sopan Deb, Slate’s Jamelle Bouie and Time’s James Poniewozik,” agreed Jeff Yang, vice president of cultural strategy for the research and branding firm Sparks and Honey, and a prominent advocate for inclusion and diversity in the entertainment industry. “Note that each of the publications these individuals work for also have sources I considered to be unreliable and in fact, truly problematic, as far as promoting trivia or spreading falsehood.”\n“Does ‘My own personal Twitter feed’ count?” as a trusted source of news, Washington Free Beacon executive editor and Act Four contributor Sonny Bunch wrote. “I mean, honestly, I trust people more than I trust institutions. And I’ve curated a feed that delivers quality news from discerning people.”\nOther correspondents passed along more specific outlets or rules of thumb.\nDara Lind, a staff writer for Vox who covers immigration and criminal-justice issues and co-writes the Vox Sentences newsletter, wrote that she has been finding the Wall Street Journal useful because the way its coverage is framed can help her see big stories from a new perspective.\n“Because its coverage of the business world and its foreign desks, for example, aren’t usually refracted through the lens of US politics, I feel that the information I get from reading the [Wall Street Journal] is more useful in helping me understand a news story on its own terms — it might not help me win an argument, but it keeps me informed,” she explained.\n“I tend to trust the outlets that run headlines at odds with their editorial point of view,” offered Ben Shapiro, who left Breitbart this year and now serves as editor in chief of the conservative site Daily Wire. “So, for example, National Review will run headlines that praise Trump even though the publication opposed Trump. [The Washington Post] will run anti-Hillary headlines. Breitbart will rarely run an anti-Trump headline.”\nNick Baumann, senior enterprise editor at the Huffington Post, wrote back with a lengthy list of basic tests for readers, among them checking how long the outlet has been around and what its leanings are, trying to figure out what else the author has written and seeing whether any other outlet has confirmed the story’s findings.\n“Does the writer show her work by saying how and where she got her information? Or does she simply assert things?” he wrote. “Do the names in this story sound made up? Are experts cited? If you Google their names, are they real? … Does this story being true require there having been a secret conspiracy to hide it? How many people would have to be involved in that conspiracy? The more people who would have had to be involved, the less likely the story is to be true. The main question is the classic one: Is this too good to be true?”\nTo Baumann’s suggestions, I’d add a few more quick checks. If there are numbers in the story, where do they come from? A recognized think tank or data-gathering government agency? If the writer Quote: s people, do they provide some indication of whether their sources’ statements are true? To Lewis’s point, does the publication employ editors, fact-checkers and copy editors, and do all of them look at every piece that’s published?\nThese ideas are only helpful, of course, if people want to verify that what they’re reading is real. For the rest of us, the fake-news epidemic demands of us that we do more than share good stories. We have to explain why we’re passing along the news, what we trust about it and why.",

      "text": "filed under: Food , fun Like us on Facebook \nIf you don’t already have a cheese advent calendar on display in your home, might we suggest another dairy-centric way to celebrate the season: Building a savory gingerbread house with a hot glue gun filled with cheese. \nThis BuzzFeed-licensed cheese extruder, dubbed the “ Fondoodler ,” is simple to use. Start by loading it up with your favorite cheese (meltable products like American, Jack, and cheddar are all great options), then give it time to heat up. Pull the trigger to begin sketching the cheesy goo on the canvas of your choice. Fondoodler provides some appealing suggestions like nachos and fancy crackers. It can even be used to write messages, build tortilla bowls , and construct edible abodes. When you're done, push the brush through the canister to ensure the tool is clean and ready to use at your next cheese party. \nThe first two batches of the product sold out quickly, but Fondoodler promises to have new orders shipped out by the first week in January at the latest. You can purchase a cheese gun of your own today for $25. \nAll images courtesy of Fondoodler . More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Like Us On Facebook \nAlisyn Camerota could not help herself. \nThe CNN anchor literally put the palm of her hand to her forehead as she tried to understand what her interviewee was saying. \nShe was speaking to Trump supporters about their opinions on the president-elect when the conversation turned to voter fraud . \nIn trying to understand the point being made, she couldn’t help but stumble over her words, \nThey do not allow illegal — you mean ille — you mean voter fraud, California allows!? \nTo see a professional journalist so floored was fascinating, to say the least, but no more fascinating than the actual conversation that led to the moment. \nThe full face-palm clip, which was uploaded onto YouTube by CNN, is about a minute and a half long and begins with a highly debatable claim from a Trump supporter named Paula. \nPaula said, \nVoting is a privilege in this country. And you need to be legal, not like California, where 3 million illegals voted. \nThe claim set Camerota off. The anchor immediately began challenging Paula’s assertion with questions like: \nSo where are you getting your information? Which media? CNN said that 3 million illegal people voted in California? Do you think 3 dozen or 3 million? Did you hear President Obama say that illegal people could vote? Tell me, where? YouTube/CNN \nIt’s pretty obvious why Camerota pressed the woman on these claims, too. Illegal immigrants cannot vote. There is no credible evidence or report of “millions” of people committing voter fraud — not from any news organizations or law enforcement agencies. \nSo where exactly did Paula get the idea that illegal immigrants were voting? Well, after a long back-and-forth, she and another woman being interviewed doubled down on the claim. YouTube/CNN \nIt was President Obama, in fact, who told illegal immigrants they could vote, the two Trump supporters claimed. The two Trump supporters even challenged Camerota to Google it. \nAnd here’s where things get interesting. Camerota puts on her glasses and actually searches for an instance in which Obama told illegal immigrants they could vote. YouTube/CNN \nCamerota’s search brought her to a Mediate article titled, “Fox Deceptively Edits Obama Interview To Falsely Claim He Told Illegal Immigrants To Vote.” \nSure enough, Fox Business Network did air a segment focusing on the president’s interview with Millennial Latino outlet, Mitú. \nDuring the segment, host Stuart Verney says Obama “appears to encourage illegals to vote and he promises no repercussions if they do.” \nOf course, the actual entirety of the president’s interview with Mitú paints a completely different picture, as Obama makes it clear only citizens can vote. \nBut it’s 2016, and we have to be real. Whether it’s what the President of the United States actually said about illegal immigrants or whether millions of illegal immigrants actually voted, facts really don’t matter as much they should. \n*Face palm.* How Fake News Stories Shaped The Election To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "share Facebook turns to AI to identify offensive Live streams The social network is working on a way to automatically detect nudity, violence and other content during live broadcasts. Share Save \nFacebook is doing its best to explain artificial intelligence through a new video series, but the social network wants to put AI to use for policing livestreams as well. The company's director of applied machine learning Joaquin Candela told Reuters that Facebook is working on a tool that automatically flags video streams for nudity, violence and any other content that violates the site's policies. Right now, the feature is being tested on Facebook Live . \nRather than relying on users to report offensive content that's then checked by Facebook employees, the system would detect any offensive material on its own. According to a Reuters report in June , the company is also working on way to flag extremist content, like violent photos or videos, but adding livestreams to the mix would require a lot more effort. \nA debate over the nature of the streaming tool was sparked by a Facebook Live broadcast that showed Antonio Perkins as he was shot and killed by Chicago Police. The company left the video up on its site with a graphic content warning attached to it because the footage served as an example of the real consequences of violence. Facebook said that it would continue to remove any clips that sensationalized violent acts. \nAs Candela explained, there are two major challenges to policing live video. \"Your computer vision algorithm has to be fast, and I think we can push there,\" Candela said. \"The other one is you need to prioritize things in the right way so that a human looks at it, an expert who understands our policies, and takes it down.\" \nFacebook is one of a number of companies dealing with the rise of fake news stories . Last month, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that in addition to easier methods for users to report a hoax, the company is working on better detection of those links before they even make it into your New Feed.",

      "text": "Sheryl Sandberg SHARES \nA good night's sleep can be the difference between a productive, efficient day and an exhausted, sloppy one. But is your rest your boss's responsibility? \nFor media mogul Arianna Huffington's new online venture, Thrive, Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg argues that maybe it is . \n\"We have to acknowledge that not everyone can get the sleep they need,\" Sandberg writes. \"So many people out there, so many single mothers and others, work multiple jobs, and we don't have the safety net we need for people to make sure that they can take care of their own health, and that we help take care of them.\" \nShe adds, \"It's incumbent upon all of us who run companies, and all of us, to make sure that people can make ends meet and have the ability to get a good night's sleep.\" \"It's incumbent upon all of us who run companies, and all of us, to make sure that people can make ends meet and have the ability to get a good night's sleep.\" -Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook COO \nSandberg is not the only top executive taking her employees' sleep needs seriously. Earlier this year, Aetna Chairman and CEO Mark Bertolini described starting an incentive program for his workers , telling CNBC, \"If they can prove they get 20 nights of sleep for seven hours or more in a row, we will give them $25 a night, up $500 a year.\" \nChronic lack of sleep is indeed a \"public health problem,\" according to the CDC, and also a productivity one that costs the U.S. economy an estimated $411 billion a year . \nHigh-functioning executives swear by the restorative power of rest . Alphabet's Eric Schmidt, Microsoft's Satya Nadella , and Amazon's Jeff Bezos are among those who aim to get around eight hours each night. \nPerhaps that's why so many wellness programs at top companies, including Facebook, feature futuristic in-office \" napping pods. \" \nStill, if the point is to allow employees to maximize sleep at night, when it does the most good, the most useful fix might be French-style rules about the \"right to disconnect,\" under which workers aren't expected to answer emails after dinner and on weekends. show chapters",

      "text": "\nDecember 01, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nHave you ever wanted to try out Facebook ad options like Carousels and Canvas but thought they look a little bit too complicated and are probably beyond your technical capacity? Or maybe you’ve considered experimenting with new ad formats but weren’t sure of how, exactly, you might be able to do it, in terms of creative execution. \nLucky for you, Facebook has a solution. Back in June, as part of the Cannes Lions Festival, Facebook announced the launch of their new Creative Hub initiative for agencies. \nAs described by Facebook : \n“[Creative Hub is] a sandbox where agencies can play with different ad formats for online and mobile and experiment with what works best. Most ad creation happens on desktop but is experienced on mobile. The Creative Hub gives ad creators an easy way to preview their work in a dynamic mobile feed. They can also share these mock-ups with stakeholders through a preview URL. The Creative Hub will also provide inspiration with an easy-to-navigate repository of case studies and great content.” \nSounds pretty cool, right? But it was only for agencies, everyday advertisers had no access. \nUntil now. \nThis week, Facebook has announced that Creative Hub is now open “to the entire global advertising and marketing community”. And as outlined above, it is a pretty handy and helpful tool. \nHere’s how it works. \nWhen you first visit Creative Hub , you’re greeted with this home page. \nAs you can see, in the top right of screen there are three main segments – “Get Inspired”, “View Formats” and “Create Mock-Up”. The sections are pretty self-explanatory – first off, “Get Inspired” is essentially an inspiration gallery, highlighting some of the best examples of the various Facebook ad formats. \nUsing the options on the left of screen, you can view all the examples available, or you can narrow them down to specific ad types – for example, click on “Canvas” and you’ll get a listing of some of the ways brands have used Canvas ads to great effect. You can also click on any of the examples for more info. \nWhat’s more, as you can see in the options below the description, you can go directly from these examples to creating your own mock-up – a great innovation in itself (more below) – or you can send it to your mobile to see what it looks like in the live environment. \nWhen you choose this option, Facebook immediately sends the example to your phone via the Facebook app – when you open the app, you’ll get a notification which enables you to view and interact with the ad as you would if it were live. \nIt’s a great way to get a better idea of the actual layout and format – you can also send a direct link to the example from Creative Hub so you can share it with others. \nIn “View Formats”, you can look through the various Facebook ad types, which all come with little tips to help you maximize each (including Instagram ads). \nBut it’s the mock-up system that’s probably the most interesting element. After you’ve browsed through the various examples and you’re feeling inspired, you can click on the “Create Mockup” option to try them out with your own content to see how your potential ads might look. \nThe process is fairly simple – once you’ve found an ad type you want to try out, you click on “Create Mockup” and you’re taken through a similar process as you would for actually creating an ad in your chosen format. \nOnce you’ve created your sample ad, you can check that it meets Facebook’s guidelines, send a link to enable others to check out your sample, send it to your mobile to see how it’ll look in the live environment (only visible by you) or save it for later. \nSample on mobile: \nYou can also see how your ads will look on News Feed or in Instagram. \nI’ve only used a simple Carousel here to demonstrate, but you can try out any ad format. This could be particularly helpful for those who’ve been considering newer options like Canvas but have felt like it’s a bit beyond their capacity. With the ability to test out the format and experiment with what’s possible, you might just be able to come up with a new way to market your brand using the latest ad options. \nThe sharing options within Creative Hub is also make it easy to share ideas with stakeholders and collaborate with colleagues, which could also help boost the performance of your Facebook ads by getting expanded feedback during the process. Of course, getting everyone’s feedback could also make it more complex, but it’s an option either way - the tools are there for you to test and try out different ideas and see what people think before you considering putting money behind them. \nIt’s an interesting initiative – it’s not ground-breaking, you’ve always been able to put an ad together in Ads Manager to try out your options before committing. But the added sampling and sharing tools, along with the noted examples, definitely add something more to the process, and could help get your creative juices flowing as you go about your Facebook ad process. \nCreative Hub is available to all users now - you can head to creativehub.fb.com to start. Facebook’s also added a new Blueprint Course on Creative Hub to help users get the most out of the option. Author Information ",

      "text": "Jennifer Aniston Says Social Media Has Ruined All Hope for a Friends Reunion \nWould you watch six people check their Instagram feeds? (Yes). By Peggy Truong Dec 01, 2016 Advertisement - Continue Reading Below In a new interview with ITV’s Lorraine show, Jennifer Aniston offers yet another explanation of why making a Friends reunion is a bad idea. “I don’t know what we would do,” she tells host Lorraine Kelly. “I think that period of time was sort of nostalgic … There was something about a time where our faces weren’t shoved into cellphones. We weren’t checking Facebooks and Instagrams. We were in a room together, or in a coffee shop together, and we were talking, having conversations. We’ve lost that.” First, Jennifer Aniston calling it “Facebooks” and “Instagrams” is everything. Second, doesn’t she know that diehard Friends fans would watch the six of them do practically anything at this point, as long the word “reunion” is involved? And having them hang out at Central Perk while checking their respective Insta feeds isn’t so bad. We’ve already done some of the work for the writers and actors (see Rachel , Ross , and Joey ’s Instagram feeds here). NBC | KATJA CHO Elsewhere in the interview, Jennifer talks about her decision to publish a candid letter earlier this year on the Huffington Post about why it’s wrong to categorize women and why it’s problematic to focus on her personal life when there are other, more important things going on in the world. “We’re seeing women through a very narrow lens,” she says on Lorraine . “We’re reduced down to something, if we don’t have a baby or white picket fence or husband, then we’re useless, and we aren’t living up to our purposes?” She adds that she’s often disturbed by the fact that women are the one usually writing about the age-old topic of whether or not the actress is pregnant. “It’s shocking to me that we are not changing the conversation and support. We’ve come so far.” Follow Peggy on Twitter . ",

      "title": "Woman jailed after setting up fake Facebook account to frame ex-love - CNET",
      "text": "Some people go to considerable lengths to hurt their exes. Photo by © Jochen Eckel/dpa/Corbis \nIt all sounds so very easy. \nStephani Renae Lawson wanted to get her ex-boyfriend into trouble. \nSo in 2015 the Las Vegas resident set up a fake Facebook account, used it to suggest that he had stalked her, kidnapped her and beaten her, and then went to the police with her accusations. \nAs the Orange County Register reports , the fake Facebook account was part of her evidence. Charges were brought against her ex, Tyler Parkervest of Irvine, California. \nParkervest first appeared in court this time last year. After all, she'd filed a total of eight police reports against him. The Facebook account in the name of \"Tyler Parker\" was, Lawson claimed, used to threaten her from testifying, among other things. \nBut it was screenshots of that Facebook account that led the district attorney's office to wonder whether this was all as it seemed. \nProsecutors asked Facebook and T-Mobile to disclose Lawson's phone and IP records. \"We had to go around and around with them all summer until we got the documents we needed,\" Deputy District Attorney Mark Geller told the Register. \n25-year-old Lawson pleaded guilty to two felonies -- one count each of false imprisonment and perjury. On Wednesday, she was sent to jail for a year. \nWhile some might ponder what would drive an ex-lover to take such extreme measures, others might consider that it appears to have been easy for Lawson to open a fake Facebook account. \nThe site has been keen to claim that it's strict about only real people being users. Its policy clearly states: \"The name on your profile should be the name that your friends call you in everyday life. This name should also appear on an ID or document from our ID List.\" More Technically Incorrect",

      "text": "Travel Salem via Flickr // CC BY-ND 2.0 Like us on Facebook \nAlfred Carlton Gilbert was told he had 15 minutes to convince the United States government not to cancel Christmas. \nFor hours, he paced the outer hall, awaiting his turn before the Council of National Defense. With him were the tools of his trade: toy submarines, air rifles, and colorful picture books. As government personnel walked by, Gilbert, bashful about his cache of kid things, tried hiding them behind a leather satchel. \nFinally, his name was called. It was 1918, the U.S. was embroiled in World War I, and the Council had made an open issue about their deliberation over whether to halt all production of toys indefinitely, turning factories into ammunition centers and even discouraging giving or receiving gifts that holiday season. Instead of toys, they argued, citizens should be spending money on war bonds . Playthings had become inconsequential. \nFrantic toymakers persuaded Gilbert, founder of the A.C. Gilbert Company and creator of the popular Erector construction sets, to speak on their behalf. Toys in hand, he faced his own personal firing squad of military generals, policy advisors, and the Secretary of War. \nGilbert held up an air rifle and began to talk. What he’d say next would determine the fate of the entire toy industry. \nEven if he had never had to testify on behalf of Christmas toys, A.C. Gilbert would still be remembered for living a remarkable life. Born in Oregon in 1884, Gilbert excelled at athletics, once holding the world record for consecutive chin-ups (39) and earning an Olympic gold medal in the pole vault during the 1908 Games. In 1909, he graduated from Yale School of Medicine with designs on remaining in sports as a health advisor. \nBut medicine wasn’t where Gilbert found his passion. A lifelong performer of magic, he set his sights on opening a business selling illusionist kits. The Mysto Manufacturing Company didn’t last long, but it proved to Gilbert that he had what it took to own and operate a small shingle. In 1916, three years after introducing the Erector sets, he renamed Mysto the A.C. Gilbert Company. \nErector was a big hit in the burgeoning American toy market, which had typically been fueled by imported toys from Germany. Kids could take the steel beams and make scaffolding, bridges, and other small-development projects. With the toy flying off shelves, Gilbert’s factory in New Haven, Connecticut grew so prosperous that he could afford to offer his employees benefits that were uncommon at the time, like maternity leave and partial medical insurance. \nGilbert’s reputation for being fair and level-headed led the growing toy industry to elect him their president for the newly created Toy Manufacturers of America, an assignment he readily accepted. But almost immediately, his position became something other than ceremonial: his peers began to grow concerned about the country’s involvement in the war and the growing belief that toys were a dispensable effort. \nPresident Woodrow Wilson had appointed a Council of National Defense to debate these kinds of matters. The men were so preoccupied with the consequences of the U.S. marching into a European conflict that something as trivial as a pull-string toy or chemistry set seemed almost insulting to contemplate. Several toy companies agreed to convert to munitions factories, as did Gilbert. But when the Council began discussing a blanket prohibition on toymaking and even gift-giving, Gilbert was given an opportunity to defend his industry. \nBefore Gilbert was allowed into the Council’s chambers, a Naval guard inspected each toy for any sign of sabotage. Satisfied, he allowed Gilbert in. Among the officials sitting opposite him were Secretary of War Newton Baker and Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels. \n“The greatest influences in the life of a boy are his toys,” Gilbert said . “Yet through the toys American manufacturers are turning out, he gets both fun and an education. The American boy is a genuine boy and wants genuine toys.\" \nHe drew an air rifle, showing the committee members how a child wielding less-than-lethal weapons could make for a better marksman when he was old enough to become a soldier. He insisted construction toys—like the A.C. Gilbert Erector Set—fostered creative thinking . He told the men that toys provided a valuable escape from the horror stories coming out of combat. \nArmed with play objects, a boy’s life could be directed toward “construction, not destruction,” Gilbert said. \nGilbert then laid out his toys for the board to examine. Secretary Daniels grew absorbed with a toy submarine, marveling at the detail and asking Gilbert if it could be bought anywhere in the country. Other officials examined children’s books; one began pushing a train around the table. \nThe word didn’t come immediately, but the expressions on the faces of the officials told the story: Gilbert had won them over. There would be no toy or gift embargo that year. \nNaturally, Gilbert still devoted his work floors to the production efforts for both the first and second world wars. By the 1950s, the A.C. Gilbert Company was dominating the toy business with products that demanded kids be engaged and attentive. Notoriously, he issued a U-238 Atomic Energy Lab, which came complete with four types of uranium ore. “Completely safe and harmless!” the box promised. A Geiger counter was included. At $50 each, Gilbert lost money on it, though his decision to produce it would earn him a certain infamy in toy circles. \n“It was not suitable for the same age groups as our simpler chemistry and microscope sets, for instance,” he once said, “and you could not manufacture such a thing as a beginner’s atomic energy lab.” \nGilbert’s company reached an astounding $20 million in sales in 1953. By the mid-1960s, just a few years after Gilbert's death in 1961, it was gone, driven out of business by the apathy of new investors. No one, it seemed, had quite the same passion for play as Gilbert, who had spent over half a century providing fun and educational fare that kids were ecstatic to see under their trees. \nWhen news of the Council’s 1918 decision reached the media, The Boston Globe’s front page copy summed up Gilbert’s contribution perfectly: “The Man Who Saved Christmas.”  ",

(Photo: Regina H. Boone, Detroit Free Press file photo) Buy Photo \nLANSING — Just two days after the bills were introduced, controversial and stricter voter identification laws moved quickly out of a House of Representatives committee Thursday afternoon. \nState Rep. Lisa Lyons, R-Alto, a term-limited state representative who won election Nov. 8 as the next Kent County Clerk, said she believes the integrity of elections needs to be strengthened, even though there have been only a handful of voter fraud cases brought in Michigan in the last several decades, according to the Secretary of State. \nHer bills would require that legally registered voters who forget their photo identification on election day to vote a provisional ballot. That ballot would be set aside and not counted until the person provided their identification within 10 days after an election at their local clerk's office. Currently, a legally registered voter who forgets their ID signs an affidavit swearing that they are who they say they are and their vote is counted on election day. More than 18,000 people who forgot their ID signed affidavits and voted on Nov. 8. \n► Stephen Henderson: The disturbing link between voter ID and Jim Crow \n\"Do I think voting irregularities happen whether they're nefarious or not, Yes I do,\" she said. \"But we don't know to what extent.\" \nDemocrats voted against the legislation, saying it will end up putting additional barriers to voting, especially to vulnerable populations, such as poor people who may have limited access to transportation, the disabled and homeless people. They tried to add amendments to the legislation that would provide better accommodations for disabled people, residents of rural areas where clerks' offices are only open a few hours a week, people whose identification has been lost, stolen or mutilated near the time of an election. They also wanted to expand the types of identification that could be used to vote, including a concealed weapons permit or a library card that has a photo on it. But all the amendments failed. \nThe one amendment that did pass was a $10 million appropriation that was tacked on to the bill to provide for education for clerks' offices, but it also makes the bill immune from a voter referendum or repeal. \nTwo other bills would waive the fees for birth certificates that are needed to get identification and for the actual pieces of identification for poor people. The bills are modeled after similar legislation in Indiana, but stricter voter ID laws, such as in North Carolina, have been struck down by the U.S. Supreme Court. \nThe bills - HB 6066-6068 - now move to the full House of Representatives for consideration. \nContact Kathleen Gray: 313-223-4430, kgray99@freepress.com or on Twitter @michpoligal CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/2grUMNu More Stories",

(I know we joke a lot, we have fun, but I’m serious. Vanilla goo.) \nAnd they hate artificial Christmas trees… with a passion, apparently. \nThe Beaver hated Christmas — the whole Christmas season. Now, please don’t ask why; no one quite knows the reason… I think that the most likely reason of all… may have been that his heart was two sizes too small. \nWait, that’s the Grinch. This beaver probably just was confused. \nA beaver in Charlotte Hall, Maryland has declared a holy war when it entered a store and beelined to the artificial Christmas tree aisle. St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office \nThis beaver just hates imposters. How is it to build a proper dam with a fake tree?! Is nothing sacred? \nListen, beaver buddy, I understand it’s not the same as a real Christmas tree, but some people have allergies or they enjoy leaving it up for a long time without worrying about it dying. \nIn a statement from St. Mary County Sheriff’s Office, authorities said, \nThe suspect attempted to flee the area. St. Mary’s County Sheriff’s Office \nThe beast was apprehended by animal control. It was not charged for it’s crimes, but was released to an animal rehabilitator. \nThe authorities tweeted, \nAll joking aside, the beaver was safely rescued by animal control and released to wildlife rehabilitation. The beaver tweet may go viral! All joking aside, the beaver was safely rescued by animal control & was released to a wildlife rehabilitator. pic.twitter.com/0VyLXJPjxh \n— St. Mary's Sheriff (@firstsheriff) November 30, 2016 \nThis beaver, who was caught at a dollar store, is probably now banned from the place of business. \nThis is a shame because dollar stores are a great place to buy material to prepare for the holidays. If you’re spending more than a dollar on wrapping paper, you’re doing it wrong, my friend. \nIt’s just going to be ripped to shreds anyway so you might as well go cheap. \n ",

But we're going to have a lot of Democrats joining us on a lot of these things, maybe even health care.\"\nThe interview followed the first rally of Trump's so-called \"victory tour\" to states that helped him defeat Hillary Clinton in last month's presidential election. \nRead the full story at FoxNews.com→",

      "title": "Best Stocks 2017: 4 Tech Companies to Buy Over Facebook or Amazon",
      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. The 4 Best Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of Facebook or Amazon for 2017 The weeks before Thanksgiving brought a cornucopia of good news to tech investor Paul Wick. Five compan ies he owned in the Columbia Seligman Communications and Information Fund were acquired in rapid succession as an M&A wave swept the semiconductor industry—a slice of the technology sector to which Wick has dedicated nearly half of his $4.4 billion fund. Meanwhile, shares in the Silicon Valley–based portfolio manager’s biggest holding, LAM Research, hit an all-time high. “Yet there’s still considerable upside,” says Wick. “We’re more bullish about the semi­conductor industry than we are about software or the Internet sector. ” Technology, though one of the most profitable and fastest-growing S&P 500 sectors, also tends to be relatively expensive. And investors are jittery about how President Trump’s policies might ­affect some of the largest players: After Facebook fb , Amazon amzn , Netflix nflx , and Google googl sold off in the wake of the election, DoubleLine CEO Jeffrey Gundlach advised investors “to stay away from these things in a big way.” But investors like Wick are finding exceptions to that ­sentiment—particularly in less glamorous but no less important corners of the industry. Though it might seem imprudent to recommend a stock that’s already risen 35% this year, LAM Research lrcx still trades at 13 times its 2017 estimated earnings. That means the stock trades at a 21% discount to the S&P 500 and is 18% cheaper than the technology sector. (For what it’s worth, LAM’s run pales beside that of the S&P 500’s best-performing stock in the first 11 months of 2016, the chipmaker Nvidia nvda , whose stock has almost tripled.) LAM doesn’t make the chips themselves, but rather equipment that companies like Samsung (one of its largest customers) use to put “flash” memory into semiconductors that are used in everything from iPhones to fitness trackers to Tesla tsla cars. Flash memory—so called because it processes data faster and with less heat than traditional hard disk drives—has become essential in enabling companies like Apple aapl to make its MacBooks more powerful and smaller at the same time, while allowing companies like Amazon and Spotify to retrieve music from their massive cloud libraries instantaneously. Historically, LAM’s stock has traded at a discount because its earnings “tend to have a lot of wiggle,” fluctuating depending on electronics’ product cycles, says USAA’s head of equities John Toohey, who is also a fan of the stock. But for the past three years LAM has grown consistently, increasing sales at a rate of 18% annually and averaging earnings growth of 56%. Wick expects that robust growth to continue in 2017, as the accelerating pace of innovation keeps semiconductor foundries buzzing: “There is no such thing as a semiconductor cycle anymore,” he says. Plus, LAM pays a dividend yielding nearly 2%—and with almost two-thirds of its cash offshore, it could benefit from a potential tax-repatriation holiday in the U.S. As the number of devices connected to the Internet has expanded, so has concern over how to keep that data safe. Spending on cybersecurity equipment, including firewalls, was on pace to grow about 13% in 2016, to $10.6 billion, Gartner says, but that rate is expected to slow to 8% over the next few years. Still, Palo Alto Networks panw , which makes state-of-the-art security systems known as next-generation firewalls, is growing its sales about four times as fast. “They’re really on the cutting edge to help people protect their infrastructure,” says Margaret Vitrano, portfolio manager of the $4 billion ClearBridge Large Cap Growth Fund. Although ups and downs in businesses’ cybersecurity spending can mean volatility for Palo Alto’s earnings and its stock, the company expects to grow revenue 31% next fiscal year, making its 2017 estimated P/E of 49 look fairly reasonable. Elsewhere in cybersecurity, Wick likes Check Point Software Technologies chkp , a cheaper option (a P/E of 17). Founded in Israel in the pre-dotcom-boom 1990s, Check Point has proved to be “much more shareholder-friendly” than some of its younger peers and social media companies, Wick says; the company has bought back stock from shareholders for 13 straight years through 2016. Other investors are rethinking what it means to be a tech stock—finding opportunities in other industries where companies are using technology to make over their business models. Henry Ellenbogen, who manages the $16.3 billion T. Rowe Price New Horizons Fund, points to Vail Resorts mtn . Once just an elite place to ski in Colorado, Vail has adopted a subscription model for lift tickets the way Salesforce crm has done for software and startup ClassPass has done for yoga and spinning classes: Think of it as a season’s pass with unlimited access to 13 different mountains in six states, Canada, and Australia. The company offers an app and harnesses its data to make chairlift lines more efficient—one reliable way to keep customers coming back. And Vail has been regularly acquiring new property and tucking it into its network, giving the company a scale that has helped Vail generate returns on capital unprecedented for its industry. The stock trades at a 2017 P/E ratio of 31, but Ellenbogen expects Vail to grow earnings organically 10% to 13% next year. PICKS: ",

      "text": "December 01, 2016 Andrew Hutchinson \nHave you ever wanted to try out Facebook ad options like Carousels and Canvas but thought they look a little bit too complicated and are probably beyond your technical capacity? Or maybe you’ve considered experimenting with new ad formats but weren’t sure of how, exactly, you might be able to do it, in terms of creative execution. \nLucky for you, Facebook has a solution. Back in June, as part of the Cannes Lions Festival, Facebook announced the launch of their new Creative Hub initiative for agencies. \nAs described by Facebook : \n“[Creative Hub is] a sandbox where agencies can play with different ad formats for online and mobile and experiment with what works best. Most ad creation happens on desktop but is experienced on mobile. The Creative Hub gives ad creators an easy way to preview their work in a dynamic mobile feed. They can also share these mock-ups with stakeholders through a preview URL. The Creative Hub will also provide inspiration with an easy-to-navigate repository of case studies and great content.” \nSounds pretty cool, right? But it was only for agencies, everyday advertisers had no access. \nUntil now. \nThis week, Facebook has announced that Creative Hub is now open “to the entire global advertising and marketing community”. And as outlined above, it is a pretty handy and helpful tool. \nHere’s how it works. \nWhen you first visit Creative Hub , you’re greeted with this home page. \nAs you can see, in the top right of screen there are three main segments – “Get Inspired”, “View Formats” and “Create Mock-Up”. The sections are pretty self-explanatory – first off, “Get Inspired” is essentially an inspiration gallery, highlighting some of the best examples of the various Facebook ad formats. \nUsing the options on the left of screen, you can view all the examples available, or you can narrow them down to specific ad types – for example, click on “Canvas” and you’ll get a listing of some of the ways brands have used Canvas ads to great effect. You can also click on any of the examples for more info. \nWhat’s more, as you can see in the options below the description, you can go directly from these examples to creating your own mock-up – a great innovation in itself (more below) – or you can send it to your mobile to see what it looks like in the live environment. \nWhen you choose this option, Facebook immediately sends the example to your phone via the Facebook app – when you open the app, you’ll get a notification which enables you to view and interact with the ad as you would if it were live. \nIt’s a great way to get a better idea of the actual layout and format – you can also send a direct link to the example from Creative Hub so you can share it with others. \nIn “View Formats”, you can look through the various Facebook ad types, which all come with little tips to help you maximize each (including Instagram ads). \nBut it’s the mock-up system that’s probably the most interesting element. After you’ve browsed through the various examples and you’re feeling inspired, you can click on the “Create Mockup” option to try them out with your own content to see how your potential ads might look. \nThe process is fairly simple – once you’ve found an ad type you want to try out, you click on “Create Mockup” and you’re taken through a similar process as you would for actually creating an ad in your chosen format. \nOnce you’ve created your sample ad, you can check that it meets Facebook’s guidelines, send a link to enable others to check out your sample, send it to your mobile to see how it’ll look in the live environment (only visible by you) or save it for later. \nSample on mobile: \nYou can also see how your ads will look on News Feed or in Instagram. \nI’ve only used a simple Carousel here to demonstrate, but you can try out any ad format. This could be particularly helpful for those who’ve been considering newer options like Canvas but have felt like it’s a bit beyond their capacity. With the ability to test out the format and experiment with what’s possible, you might just be able to come up with a new way to market your brand using the latest ad options. \nThe sharing options within Creative Hub is also make it easy to share ideas with stakeholders and collaborate with colleagues, which could also help boost the performance of your Facebook ads by getting expanded feedback during the process. Of course, getting everyone’s feedback could also make it more complex, but it’s an option either way - the tools are there for you to test and try out different ideas and see what people think before you considering putting money behind them. \nIt’s an interesting initiative – it’s not ground-breaking, you’ve always been able to put an ad together in Ads Manager to try out your options before committing. But the added sampling and sharing tools, along with the noted examples, definitely add something more to the process, and could help get your creative juices flowing as you go about your Facebook ad process. \nCreative Hub is available to all users now - you can head to creativehub.fb.com to start. Facebook’s also added a new Blueprint Course on Creative Hub to help users get the most out of the option. Author Information",

      "text": "December 1 at 3:20 PM Follow @abhabhattarai\nSheryl Sandberg, Facebook’s chief operating officer, has donated more than $100,000 worth of shares to a philanthropic fund. (Spencer Platt/Getty Images) Facebook executive Sheryl Sandberg has set aside $100 million for charity, in a move that observers say reflects a renewed sense of urgency in philanthropic giving by — and for — women following last month’s presidential election.\nSandberg donated 880,000 Facebook shares to the Sheryl Sandberg & Dave Goldberg Family Fund, according to a company filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. According to the Wall Street Journal, the “donation will be used to fund LeanIn.Org, her nonprofit focused on women’s empowerment,” among other organizations.\n“A lot of very powerful women are investing in women’s causes and, quite honestly, there’s been a renewed push to invest after the election,” said Melanie Ulle, a Denver-based philanthropic adviser and consultant to nonprofits. “Women feel that the patriarchy is alive and well — the outcome of the election confirmed that for many people — and they want to change that.”\nThousands of Americans have donated to causes related to reproductive rights and women’s issues since the election, she said. Planned Parenthood, for example, received nearly 80,000 donations in the three days following the presidential election, which the organization’s president called “an unprecedented outpouring of support,” according to The Atlantic .\n“We have this idea that philanthropy is old white men, but that is changing,” said Debra Mesch, director of the Women’s Philanthropy Institute at Indiana University. “Women are earning more money, they have more education. Their role in philanthropy has been growing exponentially.”\nMore wealthy women are making their mark publicly, not just by working behind the scenes of family foundations as they typically did in the past, Mesch said.

      "text": "The woman shared details in a Facebook post (Photo: Facebook/YouTube) Ernakulam: The arrival of online cab services like Ola and Uber among others has completely transformed public transport in India as people have increasingly been opting for booking a cab from their smart phones instead of trying to hire local rickshaws or cabs only to be refused or to be charged exorbitant rates.\nBut as Ola and Uber have made it convenient for people to travel despite a not so smoothly functioning public transport system, there has been opposition from local rickshaw and taxi drivers who have in the past even gone on strike and targeted Ola and Uber cabs to express their anger.\nIn a similar shocking incident, a woman named Vidya Gopalakrishnan became a target of rickshaw drivers in Kerala, when she decided to book an Uber from Ernakulam station to Kakkanad. The angry drivers stopped the cab and asked the driver how he picked up a passenger from the station when he knew the ‘written rule’, indicating that it’s their territory.\nThey threatened the woman when she was recording a video and asked her to take her luggage out of the cab even as she said it’s her preferred more of travelling safely. When asked if there is a law that prohibits taxis there, she was told it’s a ‘written rule’ by the transport commission.\nIn a Facebook post, she shared how the driver stood up to the bullying by rickshaw drivers and police, and was even physically assaulted as the police did nothing to help.\nThe video went viral and has more than one lakh views so far, as the woman’s post was also widely shared.",

Her father said someone made a fake Facebook page of her, creating another cyberbullying medium. \nVela said the family reported the bullying to the Texas City school district and several law enforcement agencies. \nThe father told a local television station that he hopes for stricter laws against cyberbullying and greater awareness of the problem. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Facebook suspends user over American flag image All attempts to reach Facebook have so far been unsuccessful American Mirror - December 2, 2016 Comments \nOn Wednesday morning, Facebook, the social media site increasingly known as the “ world’s most dangerous censor ,” told yours truly that a picture depicting an eagle and a U.S. flag violates their “community standards,” and further issued a 30-day ban. Worse yet, I never even posted the photo. \nHere’s the initial message: \nThat message was followed up with this: \nEarlier this week, the social media giant unpublished the popular “Wake Up, America” page, prompting the page owner to create a new page. It’s also interesting to note that the owner of the page was once banned by Facebook over a photo of a 2012 Donald Trump campaign button the site falsely claimed violated their rules on nudity . The photo only showed Trump’s face. \nLet’s be clear — nothing about this image violates the company’s standards, and this action was no mistake. It was done on purpose. \nIncidents like this are the reason Adina Kutnicki, an investigative journalist based in Israel, and I wrote “ Banned: How Facebook enables militant Islamic jihad .” That book, endorsed by Pamela Geller, is available at WND and Amazon.com . \nSadly, until Congress takes action, this type of harassment and viewpoint discrimination on social media sites will continue unabated. \nUpdate 1: The picture in question seems to have been the profile picture of Wake Up America , a backup page set up when Wake Up, America was torn down. \nUpdate 2: It turns out that another conservative blogger who happens to be a contributor to this site, also got the message and received a ban. \nUpdate 3: All attempts to reach Facebook have so far been unsuccessful. \nRepublished with permission.

      "text": "The Arbor Blocks project in Seattle’s South Lake Union neighborhood. (Vulcan Real Estate Photo) Social media giant Facebook is growing its presence in Seattle in a big way, leasing a pair of planned office buildings in the South Lake Union neighborhood, right in Amazon’s backyard.\nThe two structures, known as the Arbor Blocks, are six stories and total 384,000 square feet, along with 4,100 square feet of retail along Eighth Avenue North, between Thomas and Harrison Streets.\nConstruction will begin on the structures, developed by Paul Allen’s Vulcan Real Estate, by the end of the year.\nFacebook’s expansion comes just a few months after the company moved its Seattle engineering center into a new office building on nearby Dexter Avenue. The space has room for up to 2,000 people , and the developer of the Dexter Station project has already filed plans for an expansion that could give the social network even more room, if it leases the additional space.\nThis is a developing story, check back for updates. \nHere is the news release from Vulcan on the deal:\nSEATTLE – December 2, 2016 – Vulcan, Inc. today announced that it has pre-leased its Arbor Blocks project to Facebook. The project will consist of two 6-story midrise office buildings with 384,000 square feet of office space and 4,100 square feet of street-level retail along 8th Avenue North, between Thomas and Harrison Streets.\n“We’re excited to work with Facebook to help them expand their footprint in South Lake Union,” said Ada M. Healey, vice president of Real Estate at Vulcan, Inc., “We designed the Arbor Blocks with technology tenants in mind and Facebook is an ideal tenant to kick-off the project.”\nThe buildings, designed by Graphite Design Group, feature increased setbacks to preserve light and air for the existing sweet gum tree canopy along 8th avenue North. The street will be converted into a pedestrian-friendly woonerf with a specialty paving pattern and widened sidewalks. Plantings, seating and artwork will be added to enhance the street-level experience.\nAs part of Vulcan’s commitment to sustainable development practices that promote the social and economic health of the greater community, the new buildings will be targeting LEED Gold and Salmon-Safe certification.\nConstruction on the new buildings will begin by year-end 2016.\nHewitt is the landscape architect and Lease Crutcher Lewis is the general contractor.\n",

Louie Villalobos/The Republic \nSo I'm on the tail end of a bruising workweek when a friend asks me a question. \nHe wants to know what I tell my son about Santa Claus. Part two of his inquiry was what I thought the reason for Santa was to begin with. \nI pause, scanning the room to see who is there. It's a Saturday morning so literally nobody else is in the newsroom. \nThen I try to remember what my family said about Santa and what my childhood memories might be of this gift-giver to the world. \nWell, I told him, we don't really say much about Santa. Because Santa is stupid and so is his lore. \nSanta Claus doing stuff (Photo: USA Today) \nHot take incoming. \nYou see, I have zero motivation to tell The Boy about Santa and his Christmas Eve escapades. \nThe Boy won't hear from us about all the little helpers who make the gifts under cover of freezing cold. We won't tell him about some Reindeer with a red nose. \nThere will be no tale of Santa breaking and entering into our house to leave gifts. And there sure as heck won't be cookies left out. We eat cookies in this house. We don't leave them. \nWhy, you're hopefully asking yourself at this point, does this monster not push Santa's socialist agenda? \nMore \"I am your father\" podcast : iTunes | Google Play | Sticher \nWell, it's not what you might think. There are no spoiler alert warnings needed for this post. I'm not insane. You do you. \nThe reason for our steadfast campaign against this weird Christmas tradition and the bearded man behind it is quite simple. \nSanta didn't work 106 hours on the news desk in one week for a chance to buy The Boy gifts. He didn't dig through retail websites to compare prices for the one big-ticket item we think The Boy will both enjoy and learn from. He’s not ordering boxes of surprise eggs that The Boy just adores. \nSo he's not going to get credit for all that. And don't get me started on that creepy Elf who stalks shelves. \nAfter saying all that to my friend at work, I start in on the second part of his question. The why. Why has Santa become such a thing and why in the world do we pass it on to other generations. \nI go into a whole diatribe about parents trying to trick their kids into acting right and how never in the history of ever has \"Santa\" not delivered gifts to a \"naughty\" child. \nInstead I just laughed at the notion that a fat white guy dressed in red is out in these streets trying to get rewarded for the work parents do. Plus, he literally wants our cookies. No sir. Not on my watch. Read or Share this story: http://azc.cc/2gGyDrC Most Popular",

      "text": "Reddit \nThe social media team behind the Facebook page of Marine Special Operations Command was apparently pretty excited about retired Marine Gen. Jim Mattis getting tapped for Secretary of Defense. \nSo much so, in fact, that they posted a picture of the 66-year-old former four-star commander as a saint holding a grenade in one hand and a Ka-Bar knife in the other. \nThe page posted up the meme photo with a caption that parodied the Catholic \" Hail Mary \" prayer, writing, \"Hail Mattis, full of hate. Our troops stand with thee. Blessed art though among enlisted. And blessed is the fruit of thy knife hand. Holy Mattis, father of War. Pray for us heathen, Now and at the hour of combat. Amen.\" \nThe photo depicting Mattis as the \"Patron Saint of Chaos\" (Chaos was Mattis' radio callsign in Iraq) has been floating around the Internet for quite some time, having been passed around in the military ranks by many of his adoring fans. Mattis is a legend within the ranks for both his strategic genius and love of his troops, and it's clear that those same troops love him back. \nMARSOC Facebook \nThe meme has been along the sidebar of the /r/usmc community on Reddit for a while, and was shared on a thread talking about Mattis' announcement as Secretary of Defense on the incredibly popular Facebook page of Terminal Lance, a web comic that was created for active-duty infantry Marines. \nWhile it's not much of a surprise for many Marines to see the retired general portrayed in such a way, the posting by MarSoc got at least one negative comment, which spurred administrators to remove it, according to Marine Corps Times. \n\"MARSOC is committed to professionalism and supporting our great country,\" Maj. Nicholas Mannweiler, a MarSoc spokesman, told The Times. \"No offense was intended.\"",

      "text": "Facebook blocks links to B.S. Detector, fake news warning plugin Posted Not only is Facebook not providing little red warnings along with links to potentially specious news—it’s now blocking links to the plugin that did so . Over the past week, some Facebook users reported seeing content warnings next to links from established fake news domains, apparently without realizing a third party was responsible. We reported this phenomenon, later clarifying that B.S. Detector is in fact a third party plugin that both we and a number of Facebook users mistook as a testing feature. Irony! Now, if you attempt to share a link to B.S. Detector on Facebook, you’ll be met with this message. Apparently, blocking fake news (detectors) is quite simple! “I believe they are doing this because of TechCrunch article that came out yesterday, falsely identifying a screenshot of my plugin as a Facebook feature under development,” Daniel Sieradski, design technologist and creator of B.S. Detector, told TechCrunch. “It would seem I’ve caused them some embarrassment by showing them to be full of bull when it comes to their supposed inability to address fake news and they are punishing me for it.” For now, the B.S. Detector plugin itself remains functional, as do links to the plugin on Product Hunt and the Chrome app store . As recently as four hours ago, links to B.S. Detector were functional on the site. here's proof that 4 hours ago you could link to the plugin's homepage https://t.co/gmXWlmIIKg pic.twitter.com/iGnPjm246Q \n— daniel sieradski (@selfagency) December 2, 2016 “They could feasibly block the plugin, sure. They just need to counteract it with their own JavaScript or change the way they handle links in their code,” Sieradski said. “If blocking ads doesn’t violate their TOS, why should flagging fake news?” Under considerable duress following the election, Facebook has expressed its intentions to combat the myriad forms of fake news that run rampant on its massive social platform. In the meantime, those efforts remain to be seen. We’ve reached out to Facebook about the blocked link and will update if we receive a response. Featured Image: Bryce Durbin",

The Chrome plug-in page for the tool can still be shared. \nCreated to correct for fake news floating around the web, B.S. Detector works by using a list of domains with known issues, and then flagging links to those sites. Categories like “fake news,” “state news,” and “conspiracy theory” appear next to the relevant links and pages.\nThe tool gained some accidental notoriety late last night, when TechCrunch erroneously reported the tool was a feature built by Facebook itself to detect fake news. TechCrunch later updated the story to note it was seeing B.S. Detector.\nFacebook did not immediately return a request for comment asking for clarification on why the site has been blocked.",

      "title": "Student wins $27k fees from law firm that sued over Facebook post",
      "text": "When 20-year-old Lan Cai was in a car crash this summer, it was a bad situation. Driving home at 1:30am from a waitressing shift, Cai was plowed into by a drunk driver and broke two bones in her lower back. Unsure about how to navigate her car insurance and prove damages, she reached out for legal help.\nThe help she got, Cai said, was less than satisfactory. Lawyers from the Tuan A. Khuu law firm ignored her contacts, and at one point they came into her bedroom while Cai was sleeping in her underwear. \"Seriously, it's super unprofessional!\" she wrote on Facebook . (The firm maintains it was invited in by Cai's mother.) She also took to Yelp to warn others about her bad experience.\nThe posts led to a threatening e-mail from Tuan Khuu attorney Keith Nguyen. \"If you do not remove the post from Facebook and any other social media sites, my office will have no choice but to file suit,\" he told her, according to a report in the Houston Press on the saga.\nNguyen and his associates went ahead and filed that lawsuit, demanding the young woman pay up between $100,000 and $200,000—more than 100 times what she had in her bank account.\n\"I feel like they're trying to pull every single penny out of me just because I didn't want to be their client,\" Cai told the Houston Press . Cai was working six days a week to pay her way through nursing school at Houston Community College.\nNguyen said he didn't feel bad at all about suing Cai, adding: \"I feel sorry for her, because again, I gave her plenty of opportunities to retract and delete her post and she refused. She was proud: 'I've got it on Facebook. I've got it on Yelp,' with no remorse.\"\nSLAPP-down Cai didn't remove her review, though. Instead she fought back against the Khuu firm, which had only represented her for a few days. She found a new attorney, Michael Fleming, who took her case pro bono.\nFleming filed a motion arguing that, first and foremost, Cai's social media complaints were true. Second, she couldn't do much to damage the reputation of a firm that already had multiple poor reviews. He argued the lawsuit was a clear SLAPP (strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation). Like many states, Texas has a law allowing for SLAPP suits to be thrown out at early stages of litigation.\nUltimately, the judge agreed with Fleming, ordering [PDF] the Khuu firm to pay $26,831.55 in attorneys' fees.\n\"We are very happy with the judge’s correct ruling in this case,\" Fleming told Ars via e-mail. \"Texas law specifically protects folks who are exercising their free speech rights and the statute was appropriately applied in this situation. People should be free to express their opinions without the threat of a lawsuit.\"\nThe Khuu firm hasn't commented about the case.\nIn the end, Cai's saga will be one more warning sign to anyone seeking to limit US consumers' right to kvetch, whether online or off.",

      "text": "print \nSteve Jennings/Stringer/Getty Images \nIn the wake of criticism about fake news, Facebook has admitted that its stance of resisting any standards of news on its platform was \"wrong.\" \n“For so long, we had resisted having standards about whether something’s newsworthy because we did not consider ourselves a service that was predominantly for the distribution of news. And that was wrong!” Facebook VP of global comms, Elliot Schrage, said on a panel about the election and the media, Vox reported on Friday. \nIn recent weeks, Facebook has been taken to task for how widely and effectively fake news spread on its platform. A study by BuzzFeed showed that in the lead-up to the election, the top fake-news stories on Facebook outperformed legitimate news stories shared by some of the most popular media companies. \nFacebook's response was initially dismissive, with CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying particularly that \" the idea that fake news on Facebook — it's a very small amount of the content — influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea.\" \nFacebook, however, has recently begun to reevaluate its stance of fake news. Zuckerberg outlined several steps the company is taking to clamp down on the spread of misinformation, and other execs are actively discussing Facebook's role in the spread of media. \nBut Facebook has stopped short of pledging to have an editorial role. “It is not clear to me that with 1.8 billion people around the world, lots of different users and lots of different languages, the smart strategy is to start hiring editors,” Schrage said . “That’s just not what we do.” \nIn a talk on Thursday, Patrick Walker, a Facebook media partnerships exec, went a bit further. “We do not think of ourselves as editors,\" Walker said during the News Xchange conference in Dublin. \"We believe it’s essential that Facebook stay out of the business of deciding what issues the world should read about. That’s what editors do.” Still, Facebook has admitted that it needs to take some action. “We have a responsibility here. I think we recognize that. This has been a learning for us,” Schrage said .",

      "text": "WASHINGTON — Former U.S. Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. who went to prison after pleading guilty to stealing from his campaign funds, is making a plea to President Barack Obama through Facebook to grant mass pardons before he leaves office next month.\nAside from Facebook, Jackson might also be formally seeking clemency for himself from Obama — a process run out of the Justice Department.\nAfter leaving prison last year, Jackson signaled that he might ask his fellow South Sider for clemency.\nOn Facebook, Quote: : “Truly, Mr. President, with a presidential pardon equally monumental to, and greater in scope than, the Emancipation Proclamation the legacy of Barack Hussein Obama II will be one of faith, hope and love.\n“It will indicate an unprecedented amount of personal courage because it is an act of extraordinary strength. Yet, for the recipients of grace, it will be a miracle. There are millions of people who have learned their lessons, will never return to prison, who still need a clean slate. If you give it to them, it will be a miracle in their lives.”\nBecause of the nature of Jackson’s offense, though, it might be tough for Obama to give Jackson an individual break.\nThe disgraced former congressman and his wife, former Chicago Ald. Sandi Jackson (7th), pleaded guilty on Feb. 20, 2013, to looting campaign funds of $750,000 and spending much of it on personal items — ranging from the lavish, including a Rolex and furs, to the mundane, such as toilet paper bought at Costco, to the bizarre, two mounted elk heads for his Capitol Hill House office.\nSandi Jackson has also completed her yearlong prison sentence. Jackson, who represented the 2nd Congressional District, was sentenced to 30 months. His time served was cut — most likely because of good behavior and completion of a substance-abuse program.\n# pardons Jesse Jackson Jr.",

      "text": "Facebook invests $20M to catalyze affordable housing development in Menlo Park Posted Beddit 3 knows if you’ve been sleeping. It knows if you’re awake. \nAcross the Bay Area, affordable housing remains hard to come by. In a climate where many displaced residents point their blame at the techies, Facebook has decided to invest $20 million in what it calls “ A partnership to strengthen our local community .” \nIn just the last six years, San Mateo County has added 54,000 new jobs while only building 2,148 new housing units to support growth, according to a memo from the county. A large number of these jobs were born from the regions high-paying tech sector. Facebook alone is expected to increase the employee count of its Menlo Park offices to over 7,000 in the coming months. \nFacebook’s plan to combat the lack of affordable housing is to build a coalition of community groups, philanthropies and companies to try to force action on the issue. Together the new partnership will focus on increasing the stock of affordable housing, generating new economic opportunities and supporting the legal needs of residents threatened with eviction and unsuitable living conditions. \n“We all need to work together to create new opportunities for housing, transportation and employment across the region,” the company said in its announcement. \nTo start, the partnership will consist of Facebook, the local governments of East Palo Alto and Menlo Park in addition to a number of other local groups including Youth United for Community Action, Faith in Action Bay Area, Community Legal Services in East Palo Alto and Comité de Vecinos del Lado Oeste. \nThe vast majority of the company’s investment will be used to establish a Catalyst Housing Fund for “innovative and scalable” affordable housing. The specifics of what this $18.5 million pot will be used to finance haven’t been disclosed. \nAt a recent community event, Menlo Park locals tossed around ideas that included efforts to both change public opinion and the letter of the law. A marketing campaign could be used to ease community anxieties about approving new development. More tangibly, others pointed to repealing the state’s rent-control restricting Costa-Hawkins Act, allowing the conversion of garages to housing units and financing additions on existing houses made available at below-market rates. We reached out to Facebook to see if the partnership is willing to comment on any of these strategies. \nThe rest of the money is being split across a number of secondary initiatives. $250,000 will go to Rebuilding Together Peninsula, a group that supports the renovation of blighted properties. $625,000 is financing job training in technical fields and a new Facebook community liaison to connect residents with jobs at the company. Finally, $500,000 will be funneled into a legal fund for people struggling with landlord abuses and other housing malpractice. \nWe also contacted the City of Menlo Park for comment and will update this post if and when we hear back . 0",

      "title": "Facebook plans to invest $20m in affordable housing projects | Technology",
      "text": "Facebook has agreed to invest $20m in affordable housing initiatives after facing intense criticism for failing to help low-income residents in Silicon Valley where the technology boom has exacerbated displacement and gentrification.\nThe corporation, which is pushing forward with a massive campus expansion in northern California, announced on Friday a partnership with community organizations aimed at funding affordable housing construction and assisting tenants facing eviction.\nHousing activists who have long been critical of Facebook and its role in accelerating income inequality in the region said the investment marked an “unprecedented” collaboration between Silicon Valley corporations and advocacy groups and that the project could push neighboring tech companies to better address local poverty.\n“I’m hoping this fund will be the thing that starts to move the rest of the region,” said Tameeka Bennett, executive director of Youth United for Community Action (Yuca), a non-profit in east Palo Alto that helped negotiate the new agreement .\nThe housing shortage has reached crisis levels in Silicon Valley, which is also home to Google, Apple and many other wealthy technology firms. Rapid job creation combined with a lack of new housing has created an estimated shortfall of 22,000 homes, with the region building only 26% of the housing needed for low-income people, according to non-profit group Public Advocates.\nThat means only the wealthy can afford to live near their Silicon Valley jobs, forcing an estimated 70,000 low-income workers to commute more than 50 miles to work.\nFacebook, headquartered in Menlo Park, has contributed to the problem in direct and indirect ways. The company sparked backlash after it began offering generous bonuses to employees if they live near campus, which advocates say has hastened gentrification. Local real estate managers have evicted low-income tenants en masse, explicitly marketing units to Facebook employees .\nThe funding announced this week is not simply a philanthropic donation from Facebook , which is valued at $350bn. The corporation is legally required to fund certain community benefits as part of its ongoing expansion project, and activists have spent months pressuring the company to make substantial investments.\nFacebook plans to add 126,000 sq ft to its campus and bring 6,500 new employees to the area, increasing the Menlo Park workforce by 20%. Development laws mandated that the corporation contribute $6.3m to below-market-rate housing.\nStill, non-profit leaders said the housing fund could have a significant impact and noted that Facebook executives have relied heavily on the input of local advocates with the kind of intensive collaboration advocates rarely see from corporations.\n“The community groups that have the expertise really were equal players,” said Sam Tepperman-Gelfant, senior staff attorney at Public Advocates, which had raised formal objections to Facebook’s expansion proposal. \n“I hope having one large prominent Silicon Valley company leading the way on this will be a wake-up call for all the other global corporations that the Bay Area is hosting and the need for them to work locally,” he added, “rather than just thinking of themselves as global corporations that exist online.”\nIn addition to investing $18.5m toward the creation and preservation of affordable housing, the company has offered $500,000 toward legal and rental assistance to tenants threatened with displacement.\nA Facebook spokesman told the Guardian that the company doesn’t have projections on the number of housing units the partnership could fund, but noted that the $20m is an “initial contribution” and said the company hopes to “attract additional public, private and philanthropic entities to contribute to the fund”.\nKyra Brown, Yuca’s social justice program director, said it was critical that Facebook do a better job diversifying its workforce and hire locally in east Palo Alto, a historically black city. African American employees make up only 3% of the corporation’s senior leadership in the US.\n“Silicon Valley is known as this very innovative place when it comes to addressing everyday issues,” she said, “but my hope is that we also take that same innovation and apply it to social issues.” \nBrown, who grew up in east Palo Alto, said the announcement was an important first step in the tech sector helping to address inequities in the communities they’ve entered.\n“I’m glad that Facebook is thinking about the legacy it wants to leave particularly when it comes to communities of color,” she said.",

Plus, many major companies also offer interns a housing stipend. \nThe poll was conducted by Jesse Collins, who is finishing up his final semester at Purdue University and will be working for Seattle-based start-up Curalate post graduation. He asked nearly 600 new graduates and interns about offers received for start dates in 2017. He got 290 responses from new grads and 298 from interns. \nThe findings were making the rounds on Friday after Collins, who conducted similar research last year, posted the data on Twitter and various tech community sites, including a Reddit subgroup and the Facebook page Hackathon Hackers. \nCollins provided CNBC with the full data set, which we've used below to highlight the salary and housing stipend per month that interns can earn at 15 major companies.

USA TODAY \nThis is a good time for honest reflection about what you believe. \nI believe in the durability of the system outlined in the U.S. Constitution. \nI believe that national document will continue to provide the foundation for expanding human rights. \nI believe in the basic goodness of people and the power of a benevolent creator to bring out the best in all of us. \nI believe we need to focus on our shared values because it is too easy to fall into the trap of blaming each other. Or more specifically, of blaming “the other.” How 'xenophobia' became word of the year \n“Xenophobia” is dictionary.com’s word of the year based on spikes in look-ups related to the Brexit vote, the Syrian refugee crisis, transgender rights and – of course – the U.S. presidential election. \nThe word is defined as “fear or hatred of foreigners, people from different cultures, or strangers.” \nIt’s an international trend – and a scary one. In the past, it has led humanity down some very, very sinister roads. \nInterest in the word spiked in the United States in June, after President Obama described Donald Trump’s rhetoric as “nativism or xenophobia.” \nSome people learned a new word. But the concept is not new. Nor is the strategy of using scapegoats to build personal power by justifying hatred of those who look, speak or worship differently. Despite all this, there is goodness in people \nThis is a good time to reassess what matters (Photo: Dmitry Berkut, Getty Images/iStockphoto) \n“Despite being chosen as the 2016 Word of the Year, xenophobia is not to be celebrated,” says the dictionary.com website. “Rather it’s a word to reflect upon deeply in the light of the events of the recent past.” \nHere are some events I found to reflect upon. \nThere was a construction worker doing a job near our house. \nHe was a blond and burly guy who didn't look like he would understand much of the Spanish being spoken as my husband and two nephews struggled with a huge chunk of concrete that had to come out of the hole before the new fence post could go in by our back gate. \nIt wasn’t his problem or his job. But he came over to have a look. Then he told them to wait while he got a jackhammer off his truck. \nScore one for the goodness of people. Example: The butcher and his turkey gift \nThere was the butcher in the grocery story who talked to me about the after-Thanksgiving turkey I decided to buy. \nI was thrilled with the reduced price and told him I was making a dinner with all the fixings for my niece and her family who were coming up from Mexico that weekend. \nHe seemed interested, so I went on. I explained that we had celebrated Thanksgiving with my nephew in Flagstaff, but came home without any leftovers. This 19-pound turkey would fix that. \nHe told me to wait and he went through those flimsy swinging doors to the back room. \nHe returned with a 50 percent off coupon and stuck it on my turkey, making it even cheaper. “My gift to you,” he said. \nScore two for the goodness of people. Example: A lost dog and found hope \nThere was the woman who stopped her car when she saw a limping dog by the side of the road. She lured the animal to her, then called my future son-in-law, who’d been desperately looking for his dog for days after a house guest accidentally left a door open. \nThe woman had no idea who would answer when she called the number on the dog’s collar. She had the courage to be compassionate. She took time to be kind to a stranger. \nOK. Sure. Some people will dismiss these little things as trivial and unimportant. \nI see them as reaffirmations of human nature and the power every one of us has to make the world better. \nIt’s been called “trickle-up decency.” What all this means for liberals \nI like the Biblical description better: “And now abideth faith, hope, love, these three; but the greatest of these is love” (1 Corinthians 13:13). \nA lot of people did not believe that a misogynistic man who made fun of the disabled and was beloved by the KKK could become president of this country. \nBut it happened. Liberals can't afford to remain in shock. \nWhat we do now will determine what we become as individuals and as a country. \nWe need to look each other in the eyes and remember our shared humanity. We also need to honor and defend the very American idea that our nation’s diversity of people, ideas and beliefs is a strength, not a weakness.",

Photograph: Brendan Mcdermid/Reuters Olivia Solon in San Francisco   20.36   Share on Messenger Close \nIt’s a fable for our times. Someone creates a tool that flags fake news on Facebook with big red warning signs. Someone else installs said tool, forgets about it, and then mistakenly assumes that the red warning signs are evidence of Facebook’s own efforts to tackle the problem. A reputable technology website then writes a story about Facebook’s new experiment without doing any fact checking, thus generating its own piece of fake news. The icing on the cake? The fake news detector fails to recognize it as fake news. Fake news: an insidious trend that's fast becoming a global problem Read more \n“I thought it was the most meta thing I’ve ever seen: a fake news article about a fake news detector,” said Daniel Sieradski, who created the BS Detector browser plug-in to alert users to unreliable news sources. He immediately contacted the TechCrunch authors to point out their mistake, and they updated the article. \nSieradski, a 37-year-old activist and independent journalist from Syracuse, created BS Detector as a reaction to Facebook’s failure to acknowledge any responsibility for the spread of misleading and false information on its platform. \n“The proliferation of misinformation has severely impacted people’s ability to make informed decisions when it comes to politics and other issues,” he said. He was irritated by Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s claims that fake news was a difficult problem to solve and so built BS Detector to prove that it’s possible. \n“This is how anti-semitism surges in a public sphere instead of staying in the dark corners of the internet. These conspiracy theories move into mainstream discourse and become adopted as factual beliefs,” he added. \nBS Detector, which Sieradski claims has been downloaded more than 25,000 times, works by cross-referencing news links with a database of questionable news sources. If there’s a match, it injects a red warning sign flagging that the website is not a reliable news source. There are different classifications for fake news, satire, extreme bias, conspiracy theory, junk science, state news or hate groups. Sieradski continuously updates the database and provides a way for websites to appeal the classification. \n“Ultimately we could connect with media watchdog groups and work with them on an actual methodology to back our product,” he said. \nToday, in a final twist in the tale, Facebook blocked people from linking to BS Detector citing security reasons. When the Guardian attempted to post a link to bsdetector.tech, a pop-up appeared stating “message failed”. Facebook blocked BS Detector for security reasons Photograph: screengrab/Screengrab \n“Obviously it’s not a security risk because there’s no security related behavior of the plug-in. It doesn’t affect the integrity of Facebook’s operations, it just inserts an HTML element into the page. It’s not doing anything mischievous. My suspicion is that they didn’t like the TechCrunch article.” \nThe Guardian contacted Facebook to find out why the link was blocked from the social network, but the company didn’t respond. Hours later the link could be posted once again – as predicted by Sieradski himself. daniel sieradski (@selfagency) mark my words: within a few hours facebook will have unbanned https://t.co/Mf4ppZjZH7 claiming it was accidental or automated.",

      "text": "Facebook could fight fake news with curated articles Its new Collections feature will use handpicked publishers. Save Mariana Bazo / REUTERS \nThe proliferation of fake news on its network has haunted Facebook since the presidential election. Initially downplaying its impact, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has come around to start speaking on the social platform's action plan, including cutting off ad money. But now they have a new plan to ensure their users get quality content with actual facts: Handpick publications themselves. \nSources tell Business Insider that the new feature, called Collections, will serve up stories and media from sources chosen by Facebook. The social media titan has been courting entertainment and media companies in the last few weeks to create content for the new section. Early partners have been told that their created content will be inserted directly into users' News Feed, giving it a much broader reach. \nBut the entertainment focus reason enough to expect that Facebook will likely use Collections to both editorially curate superior content and compete with Snapchat. Its Discover section is seen by its 150 million daily users. But other information, from its partner list or whether Collections will include advertising or when it will debut, is currently unknown.",

      "text": "Facebook philanthropy? Social media giant to invest $20mn in affordable housing projects Published time: 3 Dec, 2016 04:44 Get short URL The Facebook campus is shown in this aerial photo in Menlo Park, California April 6, 2016. © Noah Berger / Reuters Facebook has committed to investing $20 million to develop low cost housing, job training and assistance for low-income Silicon Valley residents. This will be some welcome relief to residents who have been pushed out of the Santa Clara Valley area by tech firms. \nThe company is responding to criticisms that the tech firm is partially responsible for the influx of employees and money that has led to skyrocketed rent prices in Silicon Valley by forming a coalition with governments of East Palo Alto and Menlo Park and pledging a donation of $20 million over the next five years to building affordable housing and increasing job training. \nWhen thinking about Silicon Valley, it can be difficult to remember that it is not home to just start-ups and sprawling social media companies but also has its fair share of low-income residents who risk losing their homes to the technology boom sweeping North California’s Bay Area. \n“ When you add our growth with Stanford’s growth, with Google’s growth, with Apple’s growth, with all the other companies in the region, then together it becomes a huge amount of growth, ” Elliot Schrage, Facebook’s vice president of communications and public policy told the Mercury News. San Francisco building officials force man to move out of his wooden box, deeming it illegal https://t.co/gvtGKPpX3Y pic.twitter.com/pvIIJg1SN6 — RT America (@RT_America) April 14, 2016 \nThe Silicon Valley area has a deficit of 22,000 homes and affordable housing building projects offer respite to only 26 percent of those in need, according to Sam Tepperman-Gelfant, senior staff attorney at a civil rights law firm. This leaves the 70,000 low income workers in the area to commute 50 plus miles to get to work and affectively shut out of living in the area. \n“ The current path is unsustainable. We have a housing and transportation crisis in Silicon Valley [and] in the Bay Area ,” Schrage told Mercury News. “ We know that either we will come together and address this crisis or Silicon Valley will not be Silicon Valley in 20 or 30 years. It will move to other parts of the country and world. ” \nAs a result, Facebook is using some its $7 billion in sales to expand affordable housing in East Palo Alto and Menlo Park’s Belle Haven neighborhood. East Palo Alto is a diverse city where 16 percent of residents live in poverty and in 2014, had a median income of $52,716, meaning that they likely have a difficult time affording a home in an area where the average cost of a house has reached $1 million, according to Mercury News. \nFor many residents, this will come as a relief given that San Francisco is the second most expensive place to live in the US, according to The Council for Community and Economic Research.",

      "title": "Why Facebook should buy Twitter",
      "text": "The Twitter logo is displayed on a screen on the floor of the NYSE Thomson Reuters\nThe suitors fell one by one. Disney. Alphabet. Salesforce.\nNow, it seems no one wants to buy Twitter .\nThere is an obvious solution, though, and it would create a perfect new product. Facebook should buy Twitter, and roll it up with its Live video offering.\nFacebook’s transformation from a free social-networking website for desktop web browsers into an ecosystem of mobile apps is one of the most remarkable business and technology success stories of the last century. And yet, Facebook wants more. Facebook is a machine for capturing attention, but it has not managed to capture some key categories of the attention market, most notably “Live.”\nThere is a reason that it wants the Live market. Live is a specific category of media that relies on the frisson of knowing that you’re being shown things as they happen, in real time . The immediacy of live events can generate a more focused kind of attention than the kind of continuous partial attention that most people give to their social media timelines. And as a result, Facebook Live video streams generate more engagement than other kinds of posts, including non-Live video. Facebook believes its engagement data, so it has begun to push hard for more Live video.\n“Live is just one part of our overall video effort, but we think it has a lot of potential,” Mark Zuckerberg said earlier this year. “Friends go Live because it’s unfiltered and personal. Actors and news anchors go Live because they can reach bigger audiences in some cases than they can on even their own shows.”\nLive has also become the go-to platform for streaming police brutality .\nLive video has taken off among media companies (which are, in some cases, paid by Facebook to make content ) and some individuals. Some feel that this is the next great bucket of audience attention that Facebook is opening up. But the truth is that Facebook Live, as a real-time video platform, doesn’t work very well. It’s hard to find compelling stuff. Doing Live video is really, really hard.\nMore significantly, the idea of the Facebook timeline militates against “Liveness” and real-time storytelling. The whole point of the algorithm is to show you the best stuff, and it’s rare that a Live video actually meets that threshold. Live is not what the News Feed does.\nGetty Images\nFacebook’s News Feed is about relevance, showing you the post you want to see out of all the thousands that you might be shown. And it’s unbelievably successful at that. But the software that underpins News Feed often falls down when it comes to providing real-time updates. So, Facebook is a place where your friend’s post about making guacamole for the Warriors game gets shown to you in the fourth quarter.\nThat’s okay! In fact, it’s kind of the point. The fundamental product of the News Feed is about what is happening, not when it’s happening. And Facebook has years worth of data showing that users prefer their feeds ranked in order of relevance, rather than chronologically.\nBut there is a place where Live video makes a ton of sense. A place that has built a whole business around being a real-time news and conversation engine for the world. That place is Twitter. Where do NBA players post updates? Twitter. Where do celebrities feud, and politicians battle over policy positions? Twitter. Where do people discuss television shows and sports games as they’re being broadcast live? Twitter.\nTwitter CEO Jack Dorsey made the point that Twitter is still the best at real-time media earlier this year during a rough earnings call:\nTwitter has always been the best place to see what’s happening immediately, to see what’s happening instantly, and to bring people together around a particular shared experience. And as we talked about last time we think the easiest way to get what Twitter is, is really to show a live event; show people the great accounts who are providing insight that you can’t find anywhere else, you can’t find in your address book but you actually meet on Twitter through that experience, to connect them through a Follow and also to encourage them in a conversation.\nAP Images\nHe’s right: The people making the culture are on Twitter, making and talking about that culture in real-time.\nImagine, then, a Facebook-owned product called “Now.” You pair the Twitter timeline, showing you the real-time global text conversation, based on a list of people you follow, with the best of Live video from around the world. This would be the best real-time media product imaginable, especially with Facebook’s corporate muscle behind it.\nFor Facebook, a Twitter purchase would join a long line of strategic acquisitions made to enhance the company’s core capabilities. When Facebook bought Instagram, it didn’t just want the app’s users—Instagram brought deep, native knowledge of the mobile game into the Facebook house, where it could be used to enhance Facebook’s primary app. Same with WhatsApp, which was purchased, in part, to augment Facebook’s knowledge about the messaging world.\nTwitter would bring deep experience with the real-time world to Facebook. And as a nice bonus, Twitter would bring in a squadron of elite power users from across the celebrity and media landscape, who have gotten used to reaching their fans on Twitter.\nFor hardcore Twitter users, a Facebook acquisition would be something to celebrate. In the past several years, as Twitter has bounced from strategy to strategy in an attempt to chase user growth and justify its value to investors, the core Twitter experience has gotten a little schizophrenic—Twitter Moments appearing one day, hearts replacing stars the next, autoplaying Periscope video suddenly appearing in feeds, axing Vine, weird decisions about reply threads, and so on. (As our Felix Salmon pointed out last year , Twitter’s push for mass market growth “comes at the expense of some of the characteristics which cause its most active users…to love and value it.”)\nBut if Facebook bought it, Twitter wouldn’t have to change at all—it would simply become the backbone of Facebook’s Live offerings, and fill a niche that Facebook has had trouble building on its own. For the mainstream Facebook user, there would be Live Video. For people who wanted in on the real-time text conversation, there’d be the timeline formerly known as Twitter. Rather than trying to become something it is not, Twitter could double down on the core real-time components of its experience, while attaching itself to the most powerful mobile ad infrastructure in the world.\nAnd besides, what other choice does Twitter have, aside from finding a Bezos ?\nRead the original article on Fusion .

      "text": "Discogs Like us on Facebook \nIt seems like everybody and their mom and dads has released a Christmas album. For some artists, like Mariah Carey, it means selling millions of copies. But who wants to hear Bing Crosby sing “White Christmas” when you can hear a former reality show loser sing it? ‘Tis the season to forgo listening to your traditional holiday songs and opt for something a bit more unusual. 1. HUNG FOR THE HOLIDAYS // WILLIAM HUNG Discogs \nHung appeared as a contestant on American Idol in 2004 and blew the world away with his rendition of Ricky Martin’s “She Bangs.” Actually, he did not advance to the next round, but a cult following soon manifested. His career culminated (ended) in October of 2004, when he released his second album, Hung for the Holidays , which only sold 35,000 copies. He sings, off-key, “Winter Wonderland,” “Little Drummer Boy,” and then randomly covers Queen’s “We Are the Champions.” After the failure of this record and the release of a third and final album, Hung retired from music. 2. CHRISTMAS ON DEATH ROW // VARIOUS ARTISTS \nReleased 20 years ago, Christmas on Death Row is a compilation of various artists on the Death Row label. The music isn’t the worrisome thing here—it’s the album cover depicting Santa in the electric chair. (Don’t show it to grandma or the kids.) Songs include hits Snoop and Nate Dogg’s \"Santa Claus Goes Straight to the Ghetto\" and 6 Feet Deep's cover of “Silent Night.” If you like your holiday tunes filled with curse words, this one’s for you. 3. CHRISTMAS WITH COLONEL SANDERS // VARIOUS ARTISTS \nHonestly, this album has nothing to do with the finger-lickin’ Colonel except for the awesome album cover of him smiling while wearing a Santa hat (he could easily be mistaken for Santa, so maybe that’s the point). The album, released in 1969 (vintage!), features musical legends Chet Atkins covering “Jingle Bell Rock” and Harry Belafonte singing “Mary’s Little Boy Child.” 4. IT’S A WAFFLE HOUSE CHRISTMAS // VARIOUS ARTISTS Discogs \nSpending Christmas at the Waffle House sounds like fun. They’re open 24/7, you know. According to AllMusic.com , this is the second album the legendary chain has released, and it was compiled by Jerry Buckner and Gary Garcia, the guys responsible for the 1982 novelty song “Pac-Man Fever.” \nThere are traditional songs on the album, but few can top “ Waffle House 12 Days of Christmas ,” in which a couple sings, “My true love gave to me, 10 cups of coffee, eight chicken sandwiches, seven T-bone steaks, four eggs a fryin’, three sausage patties, two waffles baking, and a bowl of delicious hot grits” without a bit of irony. 5. MR. HANKEY’S CHRISTMAS CLASSICS // VARIOUS ARTISTS \nOn December 1, 1999, South Park aired a holiday-themed episode that featured a literal piece of crap coming alive and singing Christmas songs. One week before the episode’s premiere, the album was released. It includes songs from the episode, and a festive cover featuring Mr. Hankey chilling by the fire. Choice cuts include Mr. Garrison's “Merry F---king Christmas” and Mr. Hankey himself—“howdy ho!”—singing “Santa Claus Is On His Way.” 6. A ROSIE CHRISTMAS // VARIOUS ARTISTS \nThis album was just an excuse for then-daytime talk show host Rosie O’Donnell to brag about how she was buddies with Celine Dion, Elton John, and Elmo, then sing middling duets with them. Cher contributes (read: butchers) a dance-electro version of Darlene Love’s already-perfect “Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)” while Gloria Estefan and Rosie sing “Gonna Eat for Christmas.” Lauryn Hill’s funky “Little Drummer Boy” seems to be the only saving grace—until Rosie chimes in and ruins it. 7. MERRY, MERRY CHRISTMAS // NEW KIDS ON THE BLOCK Discogs \nReleased in 1989, at the height of NKOTB’s fame, this holiday record sold two million copies. You have to at least give the boy band props for writing a few original songs such as the sappy “This One’s for the Children”—which was a top 10 hit—and “Funky, Funky, Xmas,” which tries a bit too hard to emulate “Christmas in Hollis.” *NSYNC and Hanson also released Christmas records, so having boy bands release holiday albums is not an anomaly; the fact that NKOTB took the material so seriously is what makes it an oddity. 8. A HEAVY METAL CHRISTMAS EP // CHRISTOPHER LEE \nThe heavy metal lover never released a full Christmas album, but he did release the EP, A Heavy Metal Christmas , in 2012, containing metal covers of “ The Little Drummer Boy ” and “Silent Night.” The following year the prince of darkness released A Heavy Metal Christmas Too , including the song “Jingle Hell.” Last year he contributed “ Darkest Carols, Faithful Sing ,\" which would sadly be his last metal Christmas song, as he passed away in June 2015 at the age of 93. 9. JINGLE BABIES // ROCKABYE CHRISTMAS \nFirst we had Jingle Cats , which was annoying but somewhat cute. Then the same guy behind Jingle Cats and Jingle Dogs released Jingle Babies in 1997, which is baby sounds edited together into super annoying “songs.” The babies aren’t singing as much as they are cooing and whining through “ Jingle Bells ,” “Up on the Housetop,” and “Carol of the Bells.” The album’s tagline reads “Real babies sing holiday classics,” but it’s unknown if real babies approve. 10. AND 11. YULETIDE DISCO AND DISCO NOEL // MIRROR IMAGE \nDisco was huge in the 1970s, and apparently so were disco Christmas albums. Mirror Image released at least two Christmas records: Yuletide Disco and Disco Noel . The former features saxophone-enhanced versions of “ Good King Wenceslas ” and “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” and aren’t as disco-y as you’d hope. Then there’s \" Dear Santa, Let’s Disco \" by Snowflake, which should get the holiday festivities started. While you’re at it, you might as well listen to “ Disco Duck .” 12. CHRISTMAS AT LUKE’S SEX SHOP // LUKE CAMPBELL \nThe Miami rap group 2 Live Crew created a lot of controversy in the 1990s, so why not add fuel to the fire with a Christmas record? Throughout the 1994 album , MC Luther Campbell raps untraditional Christmas songs, such as “Ho Ho Hoes,” “2 Live Christmas, “Christmas Spliff,” and “Christmas F---in’ Day,” which sounds a lot like “Gin and Juice.” Campbell went legit and now writes for the Miami New Times . 13. THIS CHRISTMAS // OLIVIA NEWTON-JOHN AND JOHN TRAVOLTA Discogs \nThe friends sang together in Grease and the guilty pleasure film Two of a Kind , and one morning in 2012 they woke up and decided that, because it had been 30 years since they had worked together, it was time to put out a Christmas album . The couple duet on the standards “Baby It’s Cold Outside” and “I’ll Be Home for Christmas,” featuring Barbra Streisand. But Travolta can’t sing, and the album cover is just plain scary. 14. A COLT 45 CHRISTMAS // AFROMAN \nA parody Christmas record , from a Grammy-nominated rapper? Yup. In 2006, Afroman took a debauched look at Christmas with songs named “Deck My Balls” and other titles we shouldn’t repeat, plus the new classic “ O Chronic Tree ”: “O Chronic tree, oh chronic, I want you all for me.” 15. THE MOST WONDERFUL TIME OF THE YEAR // SCOTT WEILAND \nIn 2011, the late Stone Temple Pilots frontman released this bizarre album . The fact that he released a traditional Christmas album isn’t even the weirdest part though; it’s that he, for some reason, infused reggae and steel drum on “Oh Holy Night” and croons through the rest of the record. Listening to the songs, you wouldn’t know it was from a former grunge singer. More from mental_floss...",

      "text": "Follow CBSDFW.COM: Facebook | Twitter \nBIG SPRING, Texas (AP) — A woman was killed and seven other people were injured when a semitrailer crashed into a bus carrying a group of West Texas high school cheerleaders, authorities said Saturday. \nThe small activity bus, which was carrying six cheerleaders and two cheerleader sponsors, was headed home Friday night after a football game in Colorado City, Texas, when it was hit on Interstate 20 near Big Spring, said Iraan-Sheffield School District Superintendent Kevin Allen. \nThe semitractor-trailer, traveling eastbound on I-20, lost control trying to avoid hitting a car that had slammed its brakes, said Texas Department of Public Safety Sgt. Oscar Villarreal. The semitrailer then veered across the center median and entered the westbound lanes of I-20, hitting the bus. \nInvestigators are still trying to determine the cause of the crash but the road had been wet due to rainy conditions, Villarreal said. \nAllen said the crash happened so fast that the bus was unable to react to the oncoming semitrailer. \nOne of the cheerleader sponsors was killed. DPS identified her as 52-year-old Elizabeth Pope of the small West Texas community of Iraan. Pope also ran a computer lab in the district’s elementary school, Allen said. \nThe seven injured people were taken to hospitals in Big Spring and Lubbock. Four had been treated and released by Saturday afternoon. \nEric Finley, spokesman for University Medical Center in Lubbock, said three remained hospitalized — two in critical and one in satisfactory condition. \nThe cheerleaders ranged in age from 14 to 17. The other cheerleader sponsor was a 48-year-old woman. \nAllen said the school district planned to have counselors at the high school on Monday and Tuesday. The high school has 125 students, while the entire district has about 550 students. \n“Nobody in our community has ever gone through this. We are trying to figure out how do we best handle this for our kids,” he said. \n(© Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "National Aids Trust staff Facebook ID: 10096704 The trial will not seek to discover how effective the drug – brand name Truvada – is, because its efficacy has already been established, but rather to ascertain how best to identify patients most in need and administer the medication to them. Such questions will also cover how long patients should stay on the drug, whether a daily or intermittent dose is more desirable, and what proportion of sexual health clinic attendees will be assessed as eligible for PrEP.\nAs such, PrEP will be made available to anyone – including women, gay and bisexual men, and transgender people – who meets the prescribing criteria, details of which have not yet been released, but BuzzFeed News understands will include people who have had an STI in the last few months or more than one recent incident of condom-less sex.\nIn a further surprise to both the HIV sector and pharmaceutical companies, NHS England will likely be using non-branded (known as “generic”) versions of the drug, dramatically reducing the cost of the prevention method. Once the trial is over, Gilead, the company behind Truvada, which has already licensed it for generics manufacturers, will not lose out because the patent is already due to end.\nIt is because of this consideration of generics manufacturers that NHS England will be able to fund both the trial, at a cost of £10million, and the other medical interventions being considered at the same time as PrEP.\nAfter halting the standard commissioning process for PrEP in March, NHS England prompted court action from the National Aids Trust, which sought to bring PrEP back to the commissioning procedure. NHS England argued in the high court that it did not have the power to commission PrEP, as it is an HIV prevention method, and local authorities are responsible for prevention, while NHS controls treatment.\nHowever, NAT argued that the science behind PrEP unravels the notion that the drug constitutes prevention as it does not stop the virus entering the system but blocks it from taking hold and thus constitutes treatment.\nNHS England lost this case on several key points of law, appealed the ruling and then lost in the court of appeal last month.",

Future \"Glee\" star Matthew Morrison played him in the original cast of the 2002 Broadway hit musical. Millennial main man Zac Efron took the role in the 2007 movie version. \nFor Wednesday's \"Hairspray Live!\" on NBC, the part will be played a newcomer from the Detroit suburbs who was a theater kid in high school and local community productions. \nHAIRSPRAY LIVE! -- Season: 2016 -- Pictured: (l-r) back row: Ephraim Skyes as Seaweed J.

(Photo by: Brian Bowen Smith/NBC) (Photo: NBC, Brian Bowen Smith/NBC) \nMeet Garrett Clayton, the Dearborn Heights' Crestwood High School alum who'll be starring in the primetime special at 8 p.m. Wednesday alongside Kristin Chenoweth, Martin Short, Jennifer Hudson, Ariana Grande and more celebrities than you could style with a single can of Aqua Net. \n\"I had to pinch myself every time I met every person,\" says Clayton of the star-studded cast during a phone interview before yet another rehearsal. \"I love doing the show and the way we're doing it.\" Countdown to Hairspray Live! \nBased on the 1988 film by John Waters, the musical \"Hairspray\" is about a plus-size girl, Tracy Turnblad, in 1962 Baltimore who defies convention to become the darling of an \"American Bandstand\"-style show. Along the way, Tracy helps integrate the TV show within the stage show and catches the eye of Link Larkin, a high school hunk with a heart of gold. \n\"Hairspray\" debuted on Broadway in 2002 and won eight Tonys (including best musical) the following year. It finally closed in 2009, two years after the arrival of the film version starring John Travolta and Christopher Walken. But its legacy remains strong, thanks to a winning combination of retro-groovy songs, colorful staging and contemporary relevance. \n►Related: 'Hairspray Live!' set is a blast from the past \nAs Hudson, who plays Motormouth Maybelle in the NBC production, says in a promotional featurette, \"The subject of 'Hairspray' is very current to today. ... To me, the power in 'Hairspray' is no matter your size, your color, where you're from, what type of lifestyle you live, it celebrates everyone.\" \nHAIRSPRAY LIVE! -- Season: 2016 -- Pictured: Garrett Clayton as Link Larkin -- (Photo by: Andrew Eccles/NBC) (Photo: NBC, Andrew Eccles/NBC) \n\"Hairspray\" is also the latest example of NBC's critically praised (\"Sound of Music,\" \"The Wiz\") and panned (\"Peter Pan\") practice of reviving musicals as live TV specials. Newcomer Maddie Baillio stars in the lead role of Tracy. Harvey Fierstein returns to his Broadway role as Tracy's mom, Edna Turnblad, and is providing an updated teleplay. The production is being handled by Craig Zadan and Neil Mero, who've helmed all of NBC's live musicals. \nFor Clayton, this is his most high-profile assignment to date. But his success doesn't surprise his former mentor Cayla Kolbusz, who teaches English and drama at Crestwood High. She praises his positive energy and hard work as a multitalented actor, singer and dancer. \"He never did anything small. He always wanted to go big with anything, whether it was a performance or (any aspect) in a production.\" \nClayton grew up in metro Detroit and began modeling and landing parts in movies like the Michigan-made \"Virginia\" in his teens. At 19, he left Oakland University, where he was studying musical theater, to pursue his career full time in Los Angeles. He's probably best known for his roles in the Disney Channel's \"Teen Beach Movie\" and \"Teen Beach Movie 2,\" where he played the surfing star of a fictional beach movie called \"Wet Side Story.\" His other credits include a recurring role on ABC Family's \"The Fosters\" and guest spots on Disney Channel's \"Shake It Up\" and \"Jessie.\" \nThis year, he's had two projects besides \"Hairspray Live!\" that have put him opposite major stars. He has a leading role in indie drama \"King Cobra,\" a crime drama about gay porn producers that also stars James Franco and Christian Slater and premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. He also spent part of this summer with Al Pacino and Judith Light on the workshop process of a play called \"When God Looked Away,\" which is about playwright Tennessee Williams. \nClayton's regional work in musicals like \"High School Musical 2,\" \"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown,\" \"Peter Pan\" and \"Beauty and the Beast\" helped convince him that he wanted to be a performer. That realization really hit home when he was a sophomore and decided to drop out of a play being done by the Crestwood High School theater group. \"I was being a rude teenager, and I wanted to get back into sports,\" he says, describing how he switched his focus to the swim team. \nBeing away from acting made Clayton realize that it really was what he wanted to do with his life. So he went to Kolbusz and told her he wanted to audition for the upcoming \"Peter Pan.\" \nGarrett Clayton (right) as Peter Pan in a Crestwood Theatre high school production. (Photo: Courtesy Garrett Clayton) \nKolbusz was tough in her response. \"I just said, 'As of right now, I don't know if I'd trust you with a big role, because I don't know if you'd commit to it. But if you show me with the (current) production that you are committed to the show, I'd consider you for Peter Pan. We'll see.' \" \nIt was a teachable moment that hit home with the young actor. Clayton took a minor role in that production, \"Fame,\" and helped out with everything from the sets to the choreography. Says Kolbusz: \"He essentially came back as a leader rather than as a selfish actor.\" \nWhen the auditions for \"Peter Pan\" arrived, Clayton again demonstrated his renewed level of commitment. \"He came to auditions in a homemade Peter Pan costume,\" says Kolbusz, adding it was the first time she'd ever seen a student do that. He landed the title role. \nSince then, he's remained involved with the Crestwood theater troupe. He returns each year to give vocal lessons and coaching to the students. He even choreographs the dance numbers for the spring musical, according to Kolbusz. \"Our students here don't know him as Garrett Clayton, the actor. He's Gary, the drama club member.\" \nGarrett Clayton as Link Larkin (Photo: Brian Bowen Smith, NBC) \nClayton brought the same dedication to landing the role of Link. He says he pursued \"Hairspray Live!\" by asking everyone he knew about the project, even though he was skeptical of his chances. \"I figured why would they want me when they could get someone who's wicked famous or something?\" When he got a call to send in an initial demo tape, he wore the shirt from \"Teen Beach Party\" and a '60s hairdo styled by a friend he told to \"go crazy.\" \nEventually, he was asked to audition for an assistant to the \"Hairspray Live!\" choreographer, Jerry Mitchell. That led to a Facetime conversation with Mitchell during the audition, who told him, \"Oh, you're sweating. You know how to work.\" Several weeks later, in a scene out of a musical, he got the call confirming he would be Link while he was at the Hollywood Bowl watching a performance of \"A Chorus Line.\" \nClayton says he's ready for performing live on TV and enjoying the process of working with inspirations like Hudson, Chenoweth and \"Hairspray\" veteran Fierstein. \"Everybody has their own talent, and I am just absorbing it all like a sponge,\" he says. \nAnd on Wednesday, Kolbusz and the Crestwood theater kids will gather to watch \"Hairspray Live!\" together. \n\"I always knew it was going to happen,\" says Kolbusz. \"That kid who showed up in the Peter Pan costume really never went away.\" \nContact Julie Hinds: 313-222-6427 or jhinds@freepress.com.

      "text": "Derick Ion’s Facebook post.\nAs 40 people are feared dead following an illegal rave on his premises, manager Derick Ion mourned, not for those who were lost, but for his business. The fire at the Ghost Ship in Oakland on the night of December 2 has so far claimed the lives of ten people with dozens more still missing. The following day, manager Derick Ion, posted on his Facebook page, “Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah were at a hotel safe and sound… it’s as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope…. to be standing now in poverty of self-worth.” He owns the building along with his wife, Micah Allison. \nHere’s what you need to know:\n1. Ion ‘Laughed Off’ Fire Hazards According to a Former Resident Ion and Allison pictured together in May 2016. (Facebook)\nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports that Ion is the founder of the Ghost Ship Artist Collective that was run out of the warehouse. The building’s owner is Chor Ng. His daughter, Eva Ng, told the San Francisco Chronicle that the space was leased as a business and was not supposed to have people living there. \nOne person, Shelley Mack, who says she lived in the warehouse, told the Los Angeles Times, “It’s a dump and a death trap.” Mack added that there was no fire safety equipment and was populated by squatters. The Times report also says that the City of Oakland has been contacted three times about the building since 2014. In November 2016, the warehouse was investigated over illegal construction claims. \nSpeaking to ABC News, one former resident said that Ion “laughed off” fire hazards. One of the commenters under Ion’s infamous Facebook post wrote, “Derick you were warned. Every time I came to your house I warned you and you just laughed.”\nA YouCaring page has been set up to help the families of the victims. \n2. Allison Called the Building ‘a F***ing Vanguard Chalice Temple Hideout Bomb Shelter of the Soul’ in 2014 Micah Allison pictured on her Facebook page.\nIn a bizarre May 2014 Facebook post, Micah Allison wrote that the building was a “beautiful temple” that was “held together with love and blood.” The post was designed to get friends to donate money to the couple in order to help them pay the rent. A week later, Allison posted that the water was off in their building and that she needed a friend to let them use their bathtub so she could bathe the couple’s three children. \nThe San Francisco Chronicle reports that the building, also known as Satya Yoga, house Ion, Allison and their three children. The newspaper also says that in 2015, their children were tkaen by Child Protective Services and sent to live with relatives in Southern California.\nIon wrote on Facebook in May 2015 that he had been “unable to see the kids for one month as we have been working and looking for the right lawyer as well as fighting extreme depression and an overwhelming longing for our children.” In July 2015, Ion wrote that the family had been reunited. \n3. One Customer Called Ion ‘Unstable & Dangerous’ in 2015 \nAccording to his LinkedIn page, Ion is a “photographer” and “installation altar artist.” He describes himself as being “self-employed.”\n4. Ion Is Out on Probation for Receiving Stolen Goods \nTMZ reports that in January 2016, Ion pleaded guilty in an Alameda County court to receiving stolen goods. He got sentenced to 36 months probation for the crime. \n5. No Charges Have Been Filed Against Ion \nABC San Francisco reports that the fire does not look like a case of arson, according to investigators. The station does add that charges could be forthcoming for Ion and also says that the rave was operated without a license. \nElizabeth Ruiz Photos: Pictures of Woman in Von Miller’s Sex Tape A Cuban model has been accused of trying to sell a video of her and Von Miller having sex for $2.5 million.\nClick here to read more Paul Farrell is an independent journalist and senior contributor to Heavy who covers breaking news and current events.

The season's first snow is due Sunday night. (Photo: Regina H. Boone) \nUp to 2 inches of snow is expected to fall across metro Detroit this evening, marking the area's first measurable snowfall of the season. \nAccording to the National Weather Service, while accumulation is expected, temperatures right around freezing will limit accumulations by resulting in a wet, slushy snow. \nLight snow is expected to begin falling early this evening, with temperatures reaching close to 32 degrees. Accumulations will range from around a half an inch up to one to two inches in the northern metro Detroit suburbs. The snow will end around midnight, according to the National Weather Service, and is not expected to impact Monday's rush hour. \n\"We're expecting the snow to stick to mostly grassy and elevated areas,\" Meteorologist Jordan Dale said, adding that it won't stick to the roadways. \nDale said a low pressure system moving in from the west is ushering in the snowfall. The snowfall comes on the heels of a record-breaking November, which ended up being the fifth warmest November on record. \n\"This (snow) is really typical for this time of December,\" Dale said. \nCloudy conditions will remain by Monday morning as temperatures rise to the low 40s through the afternoon. Another chance for rain and snow will sweep through the area Tuesday, with highs close to 40 degrees. Dale said the snow is expected to start late Tuesday morning and continue into the afternoon. \nContact Katrease Stafford: kstafford@freepress.com or 313-223-4759.

A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. 7 EJ Montini , The Republic | azcentral.com 6:19 p.m. MST December 3, 2016 483 Shares \nRep. Kyrsten Sinema (Photo: Nick Oza/The Republic) \nShe’s a Democrat who didn’t trash Donald Trump and who didn’t cheerlead for Hillary Clinton. This perhaps makes her the politician you want all politicians to be, independent, open to working with anyone. Or perhaps it makes her a lousy team player looking out for herself. \nThose are only opinions. The facts are: \nFirst, she runs for Congress in what has been a contested district. \nSecond, she wins. \nIn that sense, her enigmatic approach to elected office makes Rep. Kyrsten Sinema the highest (and lowest) profile Democrat in Arizona. \nLast week, I asked her how that works? Just say no to partisanship x Share U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz. talks to students about the student debt crisis at ASU on Nov. 10, 2015 in Tempe, Ariz. Video by Rob Schumacher \n“One of the things that makes me different than some other people is that I’ve just said no to this whole partisan politics gig,” Sinema told me. “I’m just not going to do it. It was the ugliest political year of my lifetime. It was petty and it was personal and it was debasing and demeaning – to voters – and I just said no. I’m not going to play the game you guys are playing.” \nWhat about attacking Trump? What about fighting for Clinton? \n“I made the decision early on in the presidential election that I was not going to engage in any of that back and forth for any of the presidential candidates,” she said. “It was the worst kind of politics. I think we can do better. I think the country deserves better.” \nAlong those lines, Sinema was among Democrats who opposed the decision to retain Rep. Nancy Pelosi as the head of their caucus. \n“I’m very disappointed that our caucus has chosen to use the same failed strategy that it has used for, what, four cycles now? I think it’s a mistake,” she said. “The strategy that the caucus has used is not one that allows us to win the tough seats. I hold one of those tough seats. Contested seats. We don’t have many of those left in our column. Part of the reason is that the strategy and the message is not tailored to listening to or understanding Americans who feel left behind and forgotten. They’re upset. And I feel they have a good reason to be upset. And I feel it is an elected official’s job to go listen to those individuals, hear what they’re upset about and try to find some solution, regardless of party.” Sinema's got what the country needs x Share U.S. Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, D-Ariz., was homeless with her mother and siblings in Defuniak Springs, Fla., after her parents divorced. Her family lived in an abandoned gas station for more than two years. Nick Oza/azcentral.com | The Republic \nSinema’s life story has been told many times. Born in Tucson. Parents divorced. Several years spent squatting in an abandoned gas station . Scholarships. College. Social work. Law school. The Arizona Legislature. Congress. \nShe began her career as a political bomb thrower but decided quickly that such a strategy didn’t work. At least for her. Even as she led the fight against Arizona’s divisive Senate Bill 1070 she recalls a conversation she had with the bill’s sponsor, Russell Pearce, in the waiting room of a Phoenix television studio. \n“I was trying to figure out what I could talk to him about that wasn’t immigration,” she said. “So I asked about his family. He started talking about taking his wife to the movies. He called it ‘the picture show,’ and how he’d buy her peanut M&M’s, and how she’d put her head on his shoulder. That helped me see him as more than a political opponent. I wouldn’t say we became friends, but it allowed us to be friendly.” \nShe uses that same approach in Washington, D.C. She believes it will work even during a Trump presidency. Even with the political divisions that exist. \nIt’s possible that she is exactly what her party and the country need: An optimistic Democrat. \n“I feel confident in my ability to move forward regardless of who holds power in the House or Senate or the White House,” she said. “We are facing a difficult challenge in the next couple of years. But my willingness and ability to find common ground is my strength. That’s what I was good at as a social worker. It’s what I’m good at as an elected official.” \nShe’s also a pragmatist, however, adding, “And with a little luck -- and tequila -- I’ll be fine.” \nLikewise.

      "text": "  \nLike anything that gets posted on Facebook once with millions of shares, Hillary Clinton ‘s infamous “I’m-just-strolling-through-the-woods-like-a-normal-person” photos have become a trend. \nThe first photo of Clinton hiking in the woods surfaced just one day after conceding the election to president-elect Donald Trump , and featured an emotional post by the woman who ran into her, Margot Gerster. Facebook \nAnd though the shining star of Saturday’s episode of “SNL” was Alec Baldwin’s portrayal of Donald Trump’s Twitter obsession , a close second was the hilarious spoof titled, “The Hunt For Hill.” NBC/YouTube \nThe skit likens Hillz to the Loch Ness monster or Big Foot, and enlists a Sci-Fi Channel-esque team to interview witnesses and dust for footprints. \nHillary Clinton isn’t mythical, but that doesn’t make a sighting of her any less coveted. \nTo make this skit even funnier, Clinton has been seen in the woods IRL multiple times over the last 20 years hiking in the same fleece, recently launching memes claiming the jacket has more experience than Trump does. Twitter \n“SNL” crops actress Kate McKinnon wearing the same fleece into the real posts of fans who have spotted Clinton. One “eyewitness” refers to Hillary as an “it” and claims she wanted to thank Hillary, so chased her. The investigators say, “Our search begins in the woods of Chappaqua, where Hillary Clinton has recently been sighted by a bunch of white people with Facebook accounts.” NBC/YouTube Then the witness explains, “It seemed like it wanted time to itself, so I immediately started running after it. “ NBC/YouTube The “investigators” call to Hillary using her signature chuckle response to Trump. NBC/YouTube They “enticed” Hillary by leaving around articles about the recount in Wisconsin. NBC/YouTube Eventually, the crew gives up, after a psychic woodsman tells them Hillary has left to go grocery shopping. NBC/YouTube \nAnd the hunt shall continue. \nCheck out the entire skit below: \n ",

(Photo: Facebook) Mumbai: Shyam Rangeela, a 22-year-old young man from Rajasthan’s Mokhamwala village, has taken over the Internet with his imitation of Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s voice.\nAccording to a report, Shyam, a farmer’s son, became the latest online sensation after his video, in which he imitates Modi, went viral. “Modi ji's reaction on Sonam Gupta Bewafa hai,” reads the description of the video, uploaded from his friend’s phone on YouTube on November 19.\n\"I made the video on my friend's phone because mine wasn't working. There was no electricity in the house and we used a torch to light my face. I made the video and forgot about it. I realised that it had gone viral only two days later when I got my phone back from service,\" he said.\nAnother video of him performing at Vivekananda Institute of Technology, Jaipur, has also gone viral. He imitates both Modi and Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi in the video on gol-gappas.\n\"People laugh when I imitate Rahul Gandhi but are shocked when I do Modi,\" Shyam said.\nIronically, Shaym had come to Mumbai about six months ago with the hopes of getting a break in TV. With his video going viral and the ‘shocking’ mimicry of Modi, he has started getting calls for stand-up performances.\nSince the age of 11, Shyam had dreamt of becoming a comedian and now his dream seems to be coming true. As he now moves closer to his childhood dream, Shyam hopes to meet Modi.",

      "text": "Lucy Hale Goes Back to Her \"True Self\" With Her Latest Dramatic Hair Change By Facebook PHOTO: Getty Images \nIt's no secret that Lucy Hale is a color chameleon: Just three—count 'em, three —days ago, the former star of Pretty Little Liars went full-on pumpkin spice , showing off a reddish base and honey and amber highlights. And only about a month before that, she shed her signature dark Aria Montgomery hair after wrapping the last season of the her show, swapping it out for a warm, long ombré . And before that she's been short and platinum blond , and she's had subtle highlights and dramatic bangs . Suffice it to say, she never sticks with the same look for too long. But now she's back to black, ya'll—and it looks like it might just stick around. \nWe've noticed that although Hale obviously likes to mix up her look, she always comes back to her dark hair. This latest incarnation is no different: She posted a photo last night after celebrity stylist Kristin Ess took her short and dark again and captioned it, \"I go back to bl ck. Thank you @kristin_ess for taking me back to my true self.\" Loading View on Instagram \nEss, the genius behind Jenna Dewan Tatum's faux bangs and Ashley Tisdale's rose-tinted color , posted the same photo with the caption, \"How can the world keep up w our ch-ch-changes!?! She's back.\" \nHale might be a girl who isn't afraid of shaking up her cuts and colors, but we love that she has a signature look she can always go back to in order to feel like herself. Loading \nWe reached out to Ess for comment on the new look, and we'll update as soon as we hear back. Keywords:",

      "text": "Technically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. \nEnlarge Image A scene from the Facebook Live broadcast.\nPhoto by WPRI-TV screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET The police described Onasi Olio Rojas's Facebook Live broadcast in stark terms.\n\"He has his camera in his right hand, videotaping himself as he's driving, has no seatbelt on, he starts to hit speeds of 90 miles an hour, which increases to 100 miles an hour, then you see several erratic lane changes where he goes from the high-speed lane to the low-speed lane, into the breakdown lane, in and out of traffic,\" Capt. John Allen of Rhode Island State Police told WPRI-TV . \nPolice say he reached a speed of 115 mph as he weaved in an out of traffic on Route 6 in Providence, Rhode Island, on Wednesday morning.\nIt didn't end well. He allegedly crashed into a garbage truck at a speed police estimate as 90 mph. Police say it took firefighters some time to get the 20-year-old out of his Honda. \nHe will, they say, be arraigned. The police department didn't immediately respond to a request for comment about Rojas's condition, but reports say that it's already asked Facebook to preserve the video as evidence. \nFacebook told me it doesn't discuss specific cases. However, a company spokeswoman said: \"People watching Live video can report violations of our Community Standards, and we will take action to remove any violating content as quickly as possible. We also encourage people to contact law enforcement if they see a Live stream in which someone is in danger.\"\nMore Technically Incorrect Stephen Hawking says technology will devastate the middle class World's most interesting man attacks 'weak-ass Wi-Fi' Robots make better salespeople than humans, study says The temptation to broadcast yourself live doing dangerous or patently stupid things is too great for many, including the famous.\nGolden State Warriors' power forward Draymond Green, for example, allegedly posted a video to Snapchat, as he drove as 118mph in his new BMW. Green later apologized.\nPerforming for the camera while speeding has also led to deaths. In one case, the families of the dead released a video of the ride in the hope that others might be deterred from such behavior. \nPeople, however, will do what they will do to get noticed, if only for a few seconds or minutes. The potential consequences seem to escape them. Until those consequences hit them, that is.\n ",

Their coach, Jim Harbaugh, is building a program in Ann Arbor, and he will get his shot at the College Football Playoff soon enough. \nYet for seniors like Taco Charlton and Chris Wormley and Jourdan Lewis – NFL-level talents all – this season was it. It was their chance to compete for a national title only two years after finishing 5-7. \nInstead, they’ll settle for the Orange Bowl, a place they would’ve jumped at when they signed on at U-M under Brady Hoke four years ago. As consolation prizes, it’s not a bad one. But it’s still a consolation. \nBecause they believe, as does their coach, as did the College Football Playoff committee for part of the season, that they are one of the four best teams in the country. Heck, the committee did its best to lay out a path for the Wolverines when it unveiled its rankings on Nov. 20. It sure felt like the committee wanted U-M in the final four. \nIt was easy to see why. When the Wolverines were healthy, they looked like the second-best team in the sport, behind Alabama. The NFL draft next spring should back this up, at least in terms of talent. \nAll that talent, though, wasn’t enough. The Wolverines needed one more play. One more catch. One more stop. \nThey had chances to do each of those things in Iowa City and Columbus, the sites of their two losses. But before you start blaming the refs, know that in each game, U-M had a chance to make the play to win. \nMaybe learning how to do that is part of the process, part of the psychology required to navigate the upper echelon of the sport. Think about it this way: A year ago most of these same Wolverines – with the exception of starting quarterback Wilton Speight – entered the Ohio State game only hoping they could compete with the Buckeyes. \nErik Magnuson, U-M’s offensive tackle, admitted as much during the run-up to the game in Columbus two Saturdays ago. He flatly stated that, in the past several seasons, he and his teammates weren’t sure they could beat Ohio State. \nThat changed this year. Even after stumbling in Iowa City in early November, Magnuson and his fellow players knew they were good enough to compete. Not only that, they thought they were going to win. \nDon’t underestimate how much that matters. \nIf you’re a Michigan fan and you’re still hurting after the loss in Columbus, this is a good place to heal. U-M didn’t just polish off its brand and regain some of its buzz and blast its way back onto the national football landscape, it learned how to compete, even if it’s still learning how to win. \nWhatever else Harbaugh has done – and he’s done plenty – it’s the installation of confidence and swagger that remains most important. Last season, this program would’ve been thrilled with a chance to play Florida State in the Orange Bowl. \nThen September happened. And October happened. And the expectation changed along with all those impressive wins. \nIn that way, missing out on the College Football Playoff is bitterly disappointing for Harbaugh and his players and his staff. It was right there, a few inches away, and it slipped from their fingers. \nNow it’s time to prove this year wasn’t a one-off, a hard-to-replicate bounty of all that senior, NFL-bound talent. Here’s guessing this is just the beginning for Harbaugh, and that in most years getting to the Orange Bowl will feel like a letdown unless it's part of the Playoff semifinals. \nThat’s how it works in Columbus and Tuscaloosa. That’s the goal, too, in Ann Arbor. CONNECT COMMENT EMAIL MORE",

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Published: December 5, 2016 2:46 AM Among the most highly rated companies were the digital ones including social network Facebook at the number one position and it is followed by Google, LinkedIn, Netflix. Unilever makes it to fifth spot. (Reuters) \nHarvard Business Review recently released its list of top 20 Most, and Least, Empathetic companies. On the negative side, the list is topped by oil and gas company Bharat Petroleum. There are seven more companies which have made their way on the list. Bharat Petroleum is followed by Sun Pharmaceutical Industries and ICICI Bank. Bharti Airtel is at the fifth place followed by Larsen & Toubro and Indian Oil. State Bank of India has been placed at the 11th position while Reliance Industries got the 13th position on the list. \nEmpathy Index, which is increasingly becoming more and more important for corporates, is about how empathetic companies are in terms of creating a comfortable environment for employees and for diverse teams, retaining best people in the team and even in terms of financial rewards. \nIn its updated model of methodology, Harvard Business Review said that it has expanded its sources and adjusted its criteria in its quest of reflecting a deeper understanding of empathy. In addition to the metrics of CEO approval ratings from staff, ratio of women on board and number of accounting infractions and scandals, a carbon metric too was added this year by HBR. The survey broke down ’empathy’ into five categories including ethics, company culture, brand perception and public messaging through social media. 2 million tweets between September 27 and October 16th 2016 too were analysed for this survey. \nAmong the most highly rated companies were the digital ones including social network Facebook at the number one position and it is followed by Google , LinkedIn, Netflix. Unilever makes it to fifth spot. \nChinese companies were not included in the survey because of lack of publicly available data. Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now",

Photo by NICK OTTO/AFP/Getty Images \nThirty people have already been declared dead . \nThere may be more. \nThe fire that blazed through warehouse in Oakland, California, on Friday night during a concert left nothing but ruined lives. \nThe man who ran the so-called Ghost Ship warehouse and the commune it housed, Derick Ion Alemany, lived there with his wife, the San Francisco Chronicle reports . \nThe Associated Press reported that there were no sprinklers in the two-story building. One former resident told the AP it was \"like a horror house.\" \nYet it was Alemany's reaction to the fire that has upset many. \nAs the building still smoldered, he posted this on his Facebook page : \"Confirmed. Everything I worked so hard for is gone. Blessed that my children and Micah [his wife] were at a hotel safe and sound... it's as if I have awoken from a dream filled with opulence and hope.... to be standing now in poverty of self worth.\" \nMany on Facebook were appalled at how much he seemed to value himself and his possessions, rather than the lives so cruelly destroyed in a building that, as authorities told the Chronicle, was under investigation. \nMargot Keller's response was typical of much of the reaction: \"I hope you get the living shit sued out of you.\" \nSome went into more detail. \nCharlie Irons posted: \"Twenty five dead, more still missing, and THIS is what you post? Seriously? As both an artist and a Facilities Manager of some nearly twenty years in the bay area I am horrified by this post. Both you and the property owner are directly responsible for those lost lives.\" \n\"Your self worth? Seriously?\" said Amy Reyemeknechs. \"24 people died because you illegally held a rave party in an unsafe building you failed to get permits for and REFUSED inspectors entry a week before. All to get high on Molly and say 'f*** the establishment, f*** the rules\", right?\" More Technically Incorrect",

Photos: Journey to the other side in style Get the party started – Funerals are often uplifting occasions in Ghana, where it is widely believed that death is the beginning of an afterlife, and the deceased should receive a rapturous send off. A tradition has emerged within this culture of \"proverb coffins\" (abebuu adekai), which pay tribute to the occupant with a personalized and often spectacular design. Hide Caption 1 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style The roots – According to legend, the first abebuu adekai was created in the 1950s when a \"palanquin\" carriage was made for a tribal leader in the shape of a cocoa pod. But the leader died suddenly, and quick-thinking subjects buried him in the pod. This inspired young carpenter Seth Kane Kwei to establish his own novelty coffin studio in the town of Teshie, and the The Kane Kwei Carpentry Workshop (above) remains popular to this day. Hide Caption 2 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Maiden flight – One of the first creations of the workshop was this coffin for Kane Kwei's grandmother, who had never traveled in a plane but was fascinated by the new mode of transport. Shortly after, a boat design was requested for a fisherman, and the practice was up and running. Hide Caption 3 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Chips off the block – The abebuu adekai spread rapidly through the Greater Accra Region, with many of the leading figures emerging from the Kane Kwei stable. Legendary carpenter Paa Joe, seen with a piano design, was Kwei's nephew and apprentice, and he went on to establish his own popular studio. Hide Caption 4 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Spreading the wood – Daniel \"Hello\" Mensah, was an apprentice for Paa Joe, before launching his own practice the \"Hello Design Coffin Works.\" Hide Caption 5 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Artistic license – The coffins have become increasingly creative as the industry is established.

Hide Caption 8 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Art and craft – Creating the coffins is intensive labor, and can take several weeks to produce.The artisans typically use light, white wood from the indigenous Wawa tree, although mahogany is sometimes used for exports. Hide Caption 9 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Going global – Most of the coffins for local sales cost under $1,000, although pieces sold abroad can be more expensive. The record price for abebuu adekai is a Paa Joe design that fetched $7930 through a London auction house. Hide Caption 10 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Fine art – Many works from Kane Kwei alumni have been featured at leading art galleries around the world, such as this piece from Paa Joe at the Jack Bell gallery in London. Hide Caption 11 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Red hot – This spicy design was on display in Osnabrueck, northern Germany, also from Paa Joe.

Hide Caption 13 of 18 Photos: Journey to the other side in style Working overtime – The original Kane Kwei workshop is still thriving under the leadership of his son Cedi Anang and grandson Eric Adjetey Anang. The shop reportedly produces up to 20 coffins each month, and sends around 100 abroad each year.

      "text": "Do you use Facebook ads to promote your physical store or event? \nWant to know if your ads are driving foot traffic? \nFacebook now lets you track in-store or live event visits that occur after people see or engage with your Facebook ads. \n  how to track conversions on Facebook ads for offline events . How to Use Offline Events Ads From Facebook by Ana Gotter   What Are Facebook Offline Events? \nFacebook rolled out Offline Events in August so you can evaluate how your Facebook ads drive offline conversions such as foot traffic, event attendance, or sales in your brick-and-mortar location . \nPreviously, you couldn’t track these results accurately (or at all). The only reliable metrics were for online events that could be tracked with Facebook’s conversion pixel . The ability to track offline events is a huge development both for local businesses and those that primarily sell in-store. \nFacebook’s Offline Events works by syncing hard data of what’s happening offline with your Facebook ads. Specifically, you upload a file that has information like the customer’s name, purchase, and date of purchase. Facebook then compares that data with the users who saw specific ad campaigns, and gives you a more accurate conversion analysis. #1: Create an Offline Event in Business Manager \nYou need to use Facebook’s Business Manager to create and track your offline events . Please note that you must have an ad account linked to your business to use Offline Events. This may require you to create a new ad account within Business Manager. \nOnce you’re in Business Manager, click on the white lines icon in the top-left corner. Then click on All Tools in the lower-right corner of the drop-down menu. You need to have a Business Manager account to use Facebook’s Offline Events. \nFrom here, click on Offline Events under the Assets tab. Click Offline Events under the Assets tab in Business Manager. \nOnce you’re on the Offline Events page, click Create Offline Event Set in the top-right corner. Click Create Offline Event Set in the top-right corner of the Offline Events page. This will set the type of conversion you’re tracking. \nBefore you can create an event set, you need to accept the terms of use . Facebook says it won’t share the sales data you upload with third parties or other advertisers, but that it may use the matched data for its own research. No identifying user information will be stored or shared. \nNext, you’ll create your offline event set . Each event set is used to measure specific goals . For this example, suppose you want to focus on sales driven by Facebook ads. Other options include appointments being booked or increasing event attendance. Keep your offline event name specific so it will be easy to remember exactly what you’re measuring with your Facebook ads. \nIf you want, you can have Facebook automatically assign ad accounts to this event. If you manage multiple ad accounts, I recommend keeping it on so that you can assign the ad accounts yourself . Facebook can automatically assign ad accounts to your offline event set or you can assign them yourself manually. #2: Upload In-store Customer or Attendee Data \nAfter you’ve completed your event set, it’s time to upload the offline information for data matching. You’ll upload information like recent purchases along with your customers’ information so Facebook can match it against the users who saw your ads. \nTo get started, click Upload Offline Events . This section of offline event creation involves uploading the conversion data that will be matched against your Facebook ad campaigns. \nYou’ll need to load your in-store purchase data into a CSV or TXT file , a format that Facebook will recognize. First, choose from four different event descriptions : Event Time Event Name (with options including purchase, lead, and other) Value of purchase Currency Adding as many event descriptors as possible will provide you with better information about your offline events. \nChoose from 17 types of user identifiers . You should always use First Name, Last Name, and Email if possible, but other identifiers can give you additional analyses. These include Phone Number, Mobile Advertiser ID, Zip/Postal Code, City, State/Province, Country, and more. You can add 17 user identifiers to the data you upload to Facebook, but always make sure you use email addresses when possible. \nYou can download a file template to make it easier to plug in the desired data . Remember to add or take away identifiers as necessary. The template will look like the image below. You can add multiple types of identifying information, but you don’t need to add information like a user’s age or city, for example, if you don’t have it. \nIf you prefer, you can copy and paste the data from your files into the Offline Event creator, but I recommend you just upload the document . It’s easier to do, and you won’t have to worry about formatting errors. Either way, once you’ve uploaded the data, name your data set and click Next . Copy and paste your data or upload the data in a CSV or TXT file. \nOn the next screen, you’re asked to “map your data.” Facebook will flag any formatting errors that have occurred. For example, Facebook flagged Date of Birth in the image below. In this case, you’d need to select the format for date of birth so Facebook can interpret the data correctly. \nWhen you’re done, hit Upload. Facebook will flag any area that has formatting errors or if clarification is needed on how you’ve formatted data. \nFacebook will then hash and upload the data. As long as there are no errors, you’ll see the following message to let you know the process is complete. If your hashed data uploaded successfully, click Done to view your offline conversion data in Facebook. #3: Monitor Offline Event Conversions \nNow you can view a specific event , and see how many conversions occurred as a result of your Facebook ad campaigns . \nIn this example, the ads resulted in nine offline purchases. As an extra perk, you can use this data to create custom audiences , targeting them with Facebook ads designed to focus on more offline conversions. Even after offline events are established, you can continue to upload new data to Facebook so your analysis stays up to date. \nWhile it takes time to consolidate all of the data, everything else involving creating and monitoring offline events from Facebook ads is surprisingly easy. \nFinal Thoughts \nSocial media makes up a huge chunk of most businesses’ marketing efforts. Many rely on Facebook ads to expand their reach, build brand familiarity, and drive conversions. Until now, you could only see the online effect of these campaigns and guess about everything else. \nWith Facebook’s Offline Events, you can more reliably track offline events triggered by your Facebook ads. It may take a bit of work to set up, but the effort will be worth it, especially for local brands and businesses that rely on in-store activity. \nWhat do you think? Have you used offline events? What in-person events will you track? Share your thoughts, knowledge, and experience in the comments below! How to Use Offline Events Ads From Facebook by Ana Gotter  ",

      "text": "The European Commission this week called on Facebook, Twitter, and other major tech companies to more aggressively police online hate speech or else face new legislation that would force them to do so. As The Financial Times reports , a study commissioned by Věra Jourová, the EU justice commissioner, found that Facebook, Twitter, Google, YouTube, and Microsoft have largely struggled to comply with a voluntary code of conduct on hate speech announced earlier this year. \nEuropean governments have pressured tech companies to more proactively curb hate speech and incitement to terrorism, amid heightened racial tensions and national security concerns. The government-led effort has been particularly aggressive in Germany, where the ongoing refugee crisis has sparked a xenophobic backlash that has reinvigorated the far-right. German Justice Minister Heiko Maas recently said that Facebook should be treated as a media company, which would make it liable for any hate speech published to its platform. \n“They will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months.” Under a code of conduct announced in May, Facebook, Twitter, Google, and Microsoft agreed to review and respond to “the majority” of hate speech complaints within 24 hours. According to the commission’s report, however, only 40 percent of recorded incidents were reviewed within 24 hours. After 48 hours, that figure rose to 80 percent, according to both The Financial Times and Reuters . \n“This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies,\" a commission official told Reuters. The code of conduct has come under criticism from rights groups who have argued that it delegates disproportionate responsibility to private companies, rather than governments.\nAmong the tech companies that agreed to the code of conduct, YouTube was the fastest to respond to complaints, while Twitter was the slowest, according to The Financial Times . Removal rates were above 50 percent in France and Germany, but just 11 percent and 4 percent in Austria and Italy, respectively. \nSpeaking to The Financial Times , Jourová said that tech companies may face new laws to curb hate speech if their voluntary efforts prove unsatisfactory. EU justice ministers will meet on Thursday to discuss the report’s findings. \n“If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,” Jourová told the newspaper.",

      "text": "EU to tech industry: Remove hate speech faster or we'll make you Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft aren't delivering on promises to pull harmful messages within 24 hours. Save JOHN THYS/AFP/Getty Images \nDespite agreeing to crack down on the spread of hate speech across their networks earlier this year , four of the world's biggest technology companies aren't delivering on their promises, Reuters reports . A review conducted by EU Justice Commissioner Vera Jourova found that Facebook, Twitter, Google and Microsoft failed to flag and remove offensive content within 24 hours, with less than half of cases being responded to in that timeframe. If they don't improve their response times, new legislation could be introduced to force them to do so. \n\"In practice the companies take longer and do not yet achieve this goal. They only reviewed 40 percent of the recorded cases in less than 24 hours,\" a Commission official told Reuters . \"After 48 hours the figure is more than 80 percent. This shows that the target can realistically be achieved, but this will need much stronger efforts by the IT companies.\" \nIn May, Facebook, Twitter, Google (specifically YouTube) and Microsoft signed a voluntary code of conduct that would standardize the way users report hate speech and allow law enforcement agencies to act swiftly on harmful content. This included the removal of such content within 24 hours. They also committed to support educational programs and promote \"independent counter-narratives\" to hateful messages. \nAccording to the Financial Times , the report found that ( unsurprisingly ) Twitter was slowest to respond while YouTube was fastest. Jourová didn't single out Twitter, though, choosing to direct her ire at all of the companies involved: \"If Facebook, YouTube, Twitter and Microsoft want to convince me and the ministers that the non-legislative approach can work, they will have to act quickly and make a strong effort in the coming months,\" she told the paper on Sunday. \nJustice ministers will meet in Brussels to discuss the report on Thursday. Also on the agenda will be a discussion on how the companies are tackling \"terrorist propaganda\" and what evidence they can provide to help make convictions.",

      "text": "print \nMark Zuckerberg using the Oculus VR headset. Facebook \nEvery month or two, Facebook asks its engineers to take the day off from their regular duties to tackle any project they want. \nThese so-called hackathons aren't unusual among Silicon Valley tech companies — Google is famous for them too. For Facebook, they often lead to important products, including its first video player, its developer platform, and its chat system. \nAfter Facebook's engineers prototype their ideas, they present and vote on them among their colleagues. The highest voted ideas get presented to CEO Mark Zuckerberg and the rest of the executive team. \nAs Facebook product chief Chris Cox puts it, \"This is like our 'American Idol.'\" \nFor Facebook's most recent hackathon, the most popular ideas were shown to Zuckerberg, Cox, and other top company execs during a livestream on Zuckerberg's personal Facebook page on Monday. Not all of these creations will become real products or features, but it sounds like Zuckerberg is already ready to greenlight some of them. \nHere are the \"hacks\" that Facebook employees created: Hand controllers for the Oculus VR headset that get physically hot and cold: An employee from Facebook-owned Oculus demoed modified hand controllers for its headset that simulate the feeling of heat and cold in virtual reality using embedded thermal coolers. \"This is quite warm,\" remarked Zuckerberg while warming his hands at a virtual fire. Location requests in Messenger for when a friend is missing: If you can't find a friend and become worried about their safety, Messenger could one day let you send a request to see their location. A timer would begin on the friend's phone that gives them a chance to approve or deny the request. If the timer expires on its own, their location would be sent to you automatically. GIFs are coming to Facebook comments: Soon you'll be able to comment with GIFs in comments on Facebook. \"“I think this will be widely used,\" Zuckerberg said. Offline messaging: A Facebook engineer demoed offline messaging in the company's stripped down Messenger Lite app for emerging markets. Once implemented, the feature will allow people without internet access to message each other using the WiFi signals in their phones. Zuckerberg seemed to really like this idea during the demo and even said that “this is something that I’ve thought we should build for awhile.\" Shared photo and video galleries based on what people post in a person's comments. Facebook engineers demoed the use of machine learning to automatically create shared photo and video albums based on what people share in the comments of a post. So if you ask for photos people took at a wedding, what your friends share in your comments would be turned into a shared album for everyone to see. An update on Zuckerberg's personal smart home AI assistant: After the hackathon demos, Zuckerberg shared on update on the artificially intelligent assistant he's been building for his home all year. “It can do a bunch at this point,\" he said without getting into specifics. He plans to give a full demo before the end of the year. (No word on whether it will indeed be voiced by Robert Downey Jr. of 'Iron Man' fame.)",
