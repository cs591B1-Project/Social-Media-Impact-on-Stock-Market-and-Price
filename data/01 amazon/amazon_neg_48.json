      "text": "News \nConnected gadgets like Google Home and Amazon's Echo are neat enough by themselves, but they really come into their own when paired with connected home tech. If you'd like to get started on a collection of said tech, Google subsidiary Nest is currently holding a Black Friday Sale with $50 off of each of its flagship products: the Nest Thermostat, the Nest Cam security camera, and the Nest Protect smoke and carbon monoxide detector. All prices are good on the Nest online store. \nThe thermostat comes down to just $199 after the discount . This is the latest revision of the device, and at the moment it's available in steel, white, copper, and black finishes to match your home's décor. The Nest Cam is discounted to $149 , and that price is good whether or not you subscribe to the Nest Aware cloud video storage service. \nThe Nest Protect isn't being offered on its own at a discount, unfortunately - to get the lower price deal hunters will also have to buy two LIFX connected light bulbs, which can work with the Protect as secondary alarms (with flashing lights) and work with the Nest thermostat and other connected gadgets for standard lighting control. The bundle, normally $198.98, is down to $148.98 . White and black options are available. \nOrders of over $100 on the Nest store get free shipping, and at the moment everything is shipping out in one business day. These prices are good through Monday, November 28th. Source:",

Smartphones are easily one of the most popular product categories for a lot of shoppers this time of year, and if you're in the market for one under $100, Amazon's latest deal on the LG Stylo 2 just might be for you. The LG Stylo 2 may not be the most exciting phone around, but for the price that Amazon is asking right now, it sure does make for a great deal. The Stylo 2 boasts a massive 5.7-inch screen with a resolution of 1280 x 720 HD, and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 410 processor keeps light, everyday tasks snappy and smooth. The camera package consists of a 13MP camera on the back and an 8MP selfie shooter, and a large 3000 mAh battery should prove for more than enough juice. However, perhaps the most unique aspect about the phone is its included stylus. The stylus can be housed directly in the phone's body (similar to the Note 7), and although it isn't necessarily a must-have feature, it certainly is a nice value-add for a phone in this price range. The phone normally sells for $179.99 on Amazon for the Virgin Mobile variant of the phone, but it can now be purchased for just $69.99 (a savings of 61%). If you prefer Boost Mobile as opposed to Virgin though, you can get it for even cheaper at just $59.99. PhoneArena is on Instagram .

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - Holiday shopping took a political turn on Amazon after a Donald Trump themed Christmas ornament popped up on the retail giant's marketplace. \nThe ornament is in the shape of Trump signature red hat, which he donned on the campaign trail. It simply reads across the top \"Make American Great Again.\" \nThough the ornament is no longer available, the reviews have become a sounding board for critics of the president-elect. Many reviewers left snarky comments parodying Trump, while others more directly criticized the president-elect. \nOne reviewer even brought Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton into the fray, taking fire a Trump's defeat in the popular vote. \n\"There was a blue ornament,\" reviewer bmfc1 wrote. \"It was smarter than this one, had a lifetime of experience, supported trees of all colors and beliefs, and - get this - was love by two million more people than this ornament.\" \nMore than 80 percent of the item's reviewers are one-star, but even the five-star reviews are mostly sarcastic parodies of Trump's candidacy. \nAs of Friday morning, it had a total review score of 1.7. \nAmazon is no longer selling the ornament, but it is available from other sellers. Most are listed for more than $200 a piece. \nCopyright 2016 CNN. All rights reserved. Trump in transition President-elect Donald Trump More>>",

      "text": " 01AM PT \nThe war of words between Netflix and Amazon shifted into a new gear this week. \nJeremy Clarkson , one of the hosts of Amazon’s “ The Grand Tour ” globe-trotting auto show, disputed the claim by one of Netflix’s senior execs that the e-retailer paid a whopping $250 million for the series. “The Grand Tour” reunites Clarkson with his fellow “Top Gear” co-hosts, Richard Hammond and James May. The BBC fired Clarkson from the popular show following allegations that he assaulted a producer. \n“Amazon spent far less than Netflix would have you believe,” Clarkson said in an interview published Wednesday with CNN . “It’s nowhere near as expensive as people have been saying.” \nHe was responding to a claim by Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos, who said in an interview with the Telegraph newspaper earlier this week that A mazon paid far more than the previously reported $160 million for the 12-episode series. \n“That’s an under-reported number,” said Sarandos, who acknowledged that Netflix had bid for the show. “It was about a quarter of a billion dollars.” \nIn the CNN interview, Clarkson said that “of course” he knew what Amazon is spending on “The Grand Tour,” but declined to reveal the figure: “It’s just not a British thing,” he said, adding, “I mean, look at me. Do I look like I’m making $300 million a year?” \nThis past Monday, Amazon said “Grand Tour” broke Prime Video records after the first episode’s Nov. 18 premiere among members in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria and Germany. The company didn’t provide specific numbers except to say “millions” of users streamed the episode over the opening weekend, beating Prime Video’s previous record-holder, “The Man in the High Castle.” Related Amazon’s ‘The Grand Tour’ Leaves ‘Top Gear’ in the Dust, British TV Critics Say \nAmazon last year announced a deal with the three former “Top Gear” hosts for a new show produced by the trio’s longtime executive producer, Andy Wilman. According to Amazon, on Nov. 18 when “The Grand Tour” debuted, total new Prime membership signups exceeded all previous days with the exception of Amazon’s Prime Day, when it has offered special discounts. \nNetflix, meanwhile, has reportedly acquired streaming rights to the BBC’s revamped “Top Gear” with Matt LeBlanc . In the Telegraph interview, Sarandos tried to cast doubt on how successful “Grand Tour” would be: “It’ll be interesting with ‘Grand Tour’ to see how much of that is the players, who in many cases are big personalities, but what elements of ‘Top Gear’ will people miss?” he said. \nAmazon has said “The Grand Tour” will be available to stream in 200 countries worldwide in December — leading to speculation that the ecommerce giant will also be launching Prime Video in a global challenge to Netflix. To date, Amazon has not confirmed its plans for international expansion beyond its current Prime Video footprint, although it quietly launched the service in Australia last week . \n“Grand Tour” — which Clarkson dubbed “‘Top Gear’ in witness protection” — is the highest-rated TV show or movie by users on Amazon-owned IMDb. It currently has an overall rating of 9.6 out of 10 stars based on more than 13,000 ratings. It also currently has an audience score of 98% on Rotten Tomatoes . \nIn Amazon’s “Grand Tour,” Clarkson, Hammond and May host the show from a travelling tent in locations around the world including Johannesburg, California, Scotland, Rotterdam, Lapland, Nashville, Whitby in North Yorkshire, Stuttgart and Dubai. \nThe first episode kicked off in California, when the trio set up camp at Dry Rabbit Lake in the Mojave Desert near Lucerne Valley, outside of L.A. There, they staged a “Burning Van” festival for thousands of fans, which was featured in the series opener. Filed Under:",

      "title": "UPDATE: My kid's man-size feet are costing me a fortune",
      "text": "By Rachel Koning Beals\nZappos and Amazon offer choice, but that doesn't automatically make it easier -- or cheaper\nMy son is 9 years old, not extraordinarily tall, but wears a size-7 men's shoe.\nOr is that a kids' size 7?\nIt depends. Sizing categorization varies by brand, but size 7 can be slim pickings in the mens' or kids' departments in brick-and-mortar stores with limited inventory space. The online options are seemingly endless -- seemingly. Selection is much more select for boys in the big-pawed tween stage than for girls/women. And ordering mistakes require package returns. That's no fun for this procrastinator, even if retailers have made that increasingly smoother--shoe mega-mart Zappos and its parent Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), have free return.\nOur household has been grumbling about its barge-foot burden for some time, but it was the hunt for dressier wedding shoes for that son -- and his 11-year-old brother whose toes look like fingers but who is at least in a men's size 8 with slightly better inventory -- that about did us in.\nThe issue is compounded by the fact that my kids have narrow heels (big feet are my gift; my husband bequeathed them the fade-away heel). That means it's key to have a sales person with any expertise on brand-specific fitting help us. And when the boys can test-drive in the store, even better.\nThe National Shoe Retailers Association, in a 2012 study, said that the most popular shoe sizes have increased over the last 30 years, from size 7 1/2 to 8 1/2 for women, and from size 9 1/2 to 10 1/2 for men.\n(http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-families/features/why-our-feet-are-getting-bigger-9481529.html)\nKids are growing faster, too. Their diets have evolved -- meaning that for better or worse, they're eating more and getting bigger, and that includes their base. In 1961, the average Western 11-year-old boy had size-3 1/2-to-4 feet and the average 11-year-old girl had size-3 feet. Now the average 11-year-old boy has size-4 1/2-to-5 feet (we smashed that average) and the average 11-year-old girl has size-4 feet, according to a British podiatry association. Some industry specialists also wonder if modern society's insistence in wearing casual, less-supportive shoes has pushed many of us into bigger sizes, which only reinforces the importance of finding the right shoe for growing kids.\nBut when boys do hit the men's department with no looking back, the styles start to look, well, noticeably less juvenile, especially in dressier options. What grade-schooler wants to slip out his sneakers and right into wingtips? Hiking boots were our wedding-shoe solution, declared \"dressy enough\" because I wouldn't let my sons scuff them up before the event and because we were toasting the new couple lake-side anyway.\nRead:What not to buy at Target and Walmart (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/what-not-to-buy-at-target-and-walmart-2014-11-19)\nWith those hiking boots came a man-sized price hike. A well-made boot is probably worth every buck of its typically $200-and-up starting cost. We snared ours on the L.L. Bean clearance rack for about $150, the most money I've spent to date on kids' shoes and I instantly wondered if they'd last growing boys a full season. Adults have a savings trick when shoe and apparel shopping -- buy classics off-season.Not so easy when kid sizes are a moving target.\nI wondered if I was just lacking resourcefulness? Likely, yes. But the challenge is real, confirmed my six-foot-tall friend, Mary, who with her six-foot-six husband made a smart and funny giant-footed boy who hit men's size 9 at age 10.\n\"A decent pair of athletic shoes with the support he needs is well over $100, so we are aggressive in the sale shopping,\" says Mary, who frequently uses Amazon. \"He has a pair of size 10s ready to go in his closet as they were end-of-season and between 60-70% off.\"\n\"And, yes, dress shoes are a living hell,\" she agrees. \"The last pair I got my son was from the Target (TGT) men's department for about $25: a decent, lace-up oxford. I am not investing in a good dress shoe until he becomes the ultimate preppy and wants penny loafers daily [like his mom], which I don't think will ever happen, or he stops growing, and I don't think this will ever happen either.\"\nAlesha Giles, with 12 years of youth-department buying experience at Zappos, Nordstrom Inc. (JWN) and Macy's Inc. (M) , said the youth-to-adult price hike depends on brand. The Converse \"Chuck Taylor\" black classic goes up $15 when pushing into adult sizes. Kids' Uggs running $99 to $139 go up to $154.95 for a similar style in the adult category.\nOpinion:Is buying a pair of Ivanka Trump shoes a political endorsement? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-i-felt-about-buying-ivanka-trump-shoes-2016-10-31)\nGiles noted that Zappos is showing 907 options in size 7. They're there, I looked. That's an impressive number, but there is a noticeable dropoff of listings once you scroll down to \"big kid\" (http://www.zappos.com/boys-shoes8G?pf_rd_r=1SJB7BFJM2CYJ9KFW05B&pf_rd_p=468928c6-378a-42e5-81b1-dd7abc9761be). Lots of casual options. Dressy styles? Eh. Giles said that some brands on Zappos, especially European makers, are starting to carry so-called big kids' styles, in loafers, oxfords and other basics, up to U.S. size 8-9.\nBrands are also trying to be more trend-conscious by including what Giles called \"adult take-down,\" especially in dressy-casual. That means there's an adult-sized counterpart to select trending styles, including for Florsheim, Skechers, Sam Edelman (for girls) and the Vans Chukka.\nIn fact, the same dilemma that leaves me with a couple of Shoeless Joes in Chicago has long been a loophole for adults. Smaller-footed men and women could go for the lower price in similar or same styles by opting for big-kid sizing over small-adult sizing, especially in casual shoes like sneakers and sandals. You might think that walking around on a set of very small feet is a blessing then? Think again. Brands have caught on, says Giles, making consumers pay adult-size prices in that tricky crossover size range.\nFor my kids and Mary's son, the fact that they don't care so much about style is a blessing (moms and dads just pick) and a curse (give me at least a little clue, will you?). Says Mary: \"We usually give him a few to choose from online. He is pretty easy, as he does not care about the brand name--yet. One of his best buds is a label-whore already.\"\nA bump up, then, in our first-world grumbling. Adult-sized.\nDon't miss:Is it better to buy stuff or experiences? Lin-Manuel Miranda and my Vitamix blender have the answer (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/hamilton-duels-with-my-vitamix-blender-to-settle-the-stuff-vs-experience-debate-2016-10-07)\n-Rachel Koning Beals;\n 1028ET\n ",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why Black Friday Could Be Record Breaking for Amazon \nMany retailers are rejoicing this week as consumers are spending at record levels online this Thanksgiving and Black Friday. E-commerce giant Amazon is also capitalizing on this trend, with the company reporting that customers are shopping at record levels both on Thanksgiving and Black Friday, one of the busiest shopping days of the year. \nThe tech giant reported Thanksgiving has now become one of the busiest mobile shopping days on Amazon.com within the U.S. Mobile orders from Amazon AMZN customers on Thanksgiving Day exceeded both Thanksgiving and Cyber Monday—the Monday after Thanksgiving—in 2015. \nThe Seattle-based corporation added Black Friday shopping on Amazon.com is already on pace to surpass Black Friday last year, in terms of items ordered. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nSo far, the best-selling items being sold on Amazon.com include the company’s own hardware, such as home automation device Echo Dot and media streaming device Fire TV. Other top-selling items include Hasbro’s Pie Face Game and Sennheiser HD 598 headphones. Already, Amazon customers have ordered more than 100,000 toys thus far this Black Friday. \nAmazon’s big win in terms of online shopping could still be ahead as the company looks to Cyber Monday, with hopes that online shoppers will continue to flock to the company’s marketplace to buy holiday gifts. \nLast year, customers ordered 54 million items worldwide. This year, Amazon said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. Some promotions will include $40 off the Amazon Echo ($139.99), 50% off some toys, and as much as 50% off many video games.

Both are men of a certain age who, in addition to devotion to their respective faiths, share a lifelong friendship, and are depicted commiserating about the pain in their knees. \nEnter Amazon Prime. As soon as they take leave of each other, both men have the same idea. They whip out their smartphones and buy knee pads for each other, soon delivered by Amazon. These come in pretty handy in the act of worship, both at church and at the mosque. \nAddressing the topic of religion in a commercial endeavor can ruffle some feathers. So Amazon worked with the Interfaith Alliance, the National Council of Churches and the Islamic Circle of North America to ensure that the depiction was accurate and didn’t offend anyone. The pastor in the ad is an actual vicar in London, and the imam is the principal of a Muslim school in the same city. The commercial was shot in the St Dunstan and All Saints Stepney Church and in the East London Mosque, both in England’s capital. Most Read Stories",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Amazon Is Said to Be Discussing a $1 Billion Purchase of Dubai’s Souq.Com \nAmazon.com Inc. amzn is reportedly in talks to buy Souq.com, a Dubai-based online retail service, at a price of $1 billion. \nBloomberg reports that Amazon may seek to acquire all of the site, which initially set out to sell a 30% stake, though no final agreement has yet been reached and the talks could end up faltering. \nNeither company responded to Bloomberg ’s request for comment, and the negotiations have been carried out in private. \nBloomberg’s sources, who remain anonymous, also said the company’s current investors — Tiger Global Management and Naspers Ltd. — were considering selling off their stakes, as well. For more on Amazon.com, watch Fortune’s video: \nAccording to the company’s website, Souq.com sells more than 1.5 million products to online customers in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, and has secured some $275 million in investment since February. \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. gsj has reportedly been appointed by Souq.com to seek out potential buyers. \nAmazon.com is currently the largest online retailer in the world, with localized storefronts in Asia, Europe, North America, Oceania and South America. If finalized, acquiring Souq.com could give the company a new geographic grip on the fast-growing Middle Eastern market.",

      "text": "Wal-Mart, Target pursue Amazon in price war By LINDSEY RUPP AND SARAH VERY Bloomberg News First Published 5 minutes ago • Updated 5 minutes ago Share This Article Wal-Mart, Target and other brick-and-mortar chains are counting on heavier discounts and a bigger online selection to keep up with Amazon.com this holiday season. As Black Friday ushers in the year-end shopping rush, chains are touting larger price cuts than in 2015 — a gamble that maintaining market share is worth squeezing margins. Based on a Market Track study of holiday circulars, Wal-Mart is offering an average discount of 39 percent, compared with 35 percent last year. At Target, the price cuts grew to 38 percent from 36 percent. \"With the lines between traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce continuing to blur, the need to make a big splash during large retail events like Black Friday is significant,\" said Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track. \"The ease of comparison shopping across channels is creating a situation that puts a definitive advantage in the consumers' hands.\" VIDEOS TOP JOBS Wal-Mart and others also are steering customers toward online deals, rather than just physical stores. While the chain still offers Black Friday specials at its supercenters, the day marks the beginning of a streak of online promotions called \"Cyber Week.\" Wal-Mart has tripled its e-commerce selection to 23 million products this year, aiming to better compete with Amazon. The world's largest retailer said in a statement Friday that Thanksgiving was one of its top online-shopping days this year and that about 70 percent of the traffic to its website came from mobile devices. Target, meanwhile, is offering 15 percent off almost everything in its stores and website for two days: Sunday and Monday. The aggressive discounts come at a cost. When Target slashed prices last holiday season, its profit margin slipped to 27.9 percent from 28.5 percent. The National Retail Federation estimates that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that started on Thanksgiving. But the amount that Americans have spent has declined in the past three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person in 2015. That's a sign that holiday purchases are spreading out over a longer time frame. Spending during the overall season -- November and December -- is still expected to grow 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, the NRF estimates. With Americans shifting their purchases online, the urgency of offering deals on Black Friday itself has diminished. EBay made a plea for consumers to start shopping on their phones the day before Thanksgiving, christening the event \"Mobile Wednesday.\" One thing giving retailers optimism this year: There may be pent-up demand after a polarizing presidential election. Many chains, including Kohl's Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc., blamed the campaign season for hurting spending. With the outcome settled, they're expecting the dollars to finally flow. Investors are bullish as well. The Standard & Poor's 500 Retail Index has risen 4.9 percent so far in November and is on pace for its best monthly return since July. Retail stocks have outpaced the broader market following the election, with the index up 4.7 percent since Nov. 8. Historical studies indicate that elections affect the timing of retail sales rather than the overall volume, said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson's Bay Co. That means shoppers will usually spend the same amount, even if the election puts them off spending for a while. \"Hopefully, when we get to Black Friday, which really tolls the bell of holiday shopping, then the consumer will start looking forward to Christmas,\" Storch said. The challenge for traditional retailers is preventing consumers from becoming \"locked in\" at Amazon. Many shoppers begin their product searches there -- and never leave. \"If Amazon had everything, like everything you need in the world, I would buy everything from there,\" said Oscar Viral, 58, a chef in New York. \"I wanted something from Macy's, and I got on the internet because they didn't have it available in the store.\" No matter when they shop, customers will be hunting for bargains. While a survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83 percent of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season, mobile phones are making price comparisons simpler than ever. \"We like to scope it out in person, then we go online,\" said Natalie Kelly, a hospitality worker in Florida who was shopping at a mall in Manhattan earlier this week. \"To get me to go into the department store, things would have to be discounted more than they are online.\"",

Was going to trade Gears and Tomb Raider in but glad I've hung on You guys recon they'll reduce the other bundles even more then? I already own the original Xbox One but just bought a 4K TV and want this new one. Since I already own an Xbox One I don't really wanna pay too much for another. This seems like a really good price, I'm worried they'll bump it back up later and won't reduce the others :( ditto i'm in the situation got an original xbox one with a 4k tv arriving in december i don't like the white s version so looking out for a cheaper grey console bundle will leave until closer to christmas and see if they get cheaper.",

      "text": "Peak Amazon? It May Begin With A Bang, Not A Whimper Nov.25.16 Send Message Summary \nAMZN is in the news as \"Cyber Monday\" approaches, and the headlines talk of strong growth of online commerce. \nMy thesis is that everyone has already priced all this in. \nMore important to me is that the influential financial media in the form of Bloomberg News is talking openly of price wars in online commerce. \nIn addition, AMZN is apparently going to burn cash to chase NFLX in. Introduction I feel as though I'm seeing a movie unfold that I've seen before - only the actors and the plot details have changed. In this version, the hero is called Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN ). In Y2K, it was called Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and Yahoo! (NASDAQ: YHOO ), among many other names. In 2007, it was BofA (NYSE: BAC ). In 1980 and again in 2011, it was silver (NYSEARCA: SLV ). The names change, but the general pattern repeats, and one way to achieve alpha is simply to invest away from overpriced hot sectors where competition is visibly arriving. Yes, the headlines of the day include booming online sales this weekend. But we all knew those headlines were coming. So that's part of the problem. We can't really be surprised by booming online sales. What we should be surprised at is that AMZN feels it needs to open physical bookstores to keep on growing. And apparently also physical grocery stores. So is it just becoming its competitors, coming at their business model from online first while they add online services to their brick-and-mortar-based initial business model? In addition to its retail business, AMZN needs absolutely no introduction - which is another part of the problem . Everyone knows the company, and everyone knows the stock. The growth story has been told, retold, told again, priced in, then priced in some more. That's what I think. I think that few investors really believe that paying 170X trailing 12-month earnings for this stock is going to yield a positive economic return above the cost of a safer Amazon bond (or the equivalent) in any thinkable time frame. While investors think they know Amazon, as I pointed out in the first of my prior bearish articles on AMZN , few know that even as of now, its entire net worth appears to come solely from the sale of stock. This involves both sales to the public and sales to insiders who exercise options and then almost always have flipped the entirety of the package. So what's AMZN really achieved in more than 20 years of selling stuff over the Internet? As a writer and analyst, I find AMZN worth writing about because of the intense interest and even passion it arouses, but I have no position in the stock or any derivative related to it, and plan to have none. Nor do I have any associations with any interested parties who would benefit in any way from a move in AMZN or its derivatives. Thus, this article is just an article expressing a point of view, nothing more. Let me update some prior comments on AMZN. AMZN should have a good December quarter Its guidance for Q4 given during its Q3 earnings discussion was cautious. The company even suggested it might just break even this quarter. My guess is that this was typical sandbagging and that the quarter will therefore \"beat.\" But I doubt it will matter in the long run, because it's well known that AMZN is a strong company. The problem is that it's this Internet bubble era's Cisco, but without the wide moat that CSCO's core router and related businesses provided it. None of AMZN's interrelated businesses have much of a moat. Not web services, not its proprietary devices, and certainly not general retailing of products designed and manufactured by other companies. None of those companies want to be dependent on AMZN. Perhaps the greatest differentiating factor that is moat-like for AMZN is the \"sleepless in Seattle\" work-till-you-drop ethos. That may be already getting played out. It happens at all hard-driving companies that achieve AMZN's level of success. I'm not close to being an insider, but it's the rule. Mr. Bezos himself, theoretically among the world's top 10 richest people, has conquered all the business world he may want to. His goal may now involve conquering outer space, running for president, or other more exotic things. He may no longer want to bombard subordinates at midnight with phone calls or emails with questions or ideas on how to make AMZN even better. Thus, I would fade that aspect of AMZN without being able to time it. With those comments, I want to explain why some of today's news items got me thinking that the stock market top for AMZN may be in now, or is coming after Q4 results are released. A lot of this thinking is similar to my observations about Gilead (NASDAQ: GILD ), which began sinking in price as its dominance in hepatitis C treatments was peaking - and when its P/E was more like 12X, not 170X or so as AMZN sports. The first news item comes from Bloomberg News. Is Bloomberg ringing a bell for AMZN near the top? My view is that this could be an ominous headline to appear on Black Friday: \nHoliday Price War Intensifies as Wal-Mart, Target Pursue Amazon I'm forgetting Wal-Mart (NYSE: WMT ) and Target (NYSE: TGT ) are not at AMZN's technical level re online sales. But I'm also not forgetting that these companies have something AMZN largely lacks, namely established profit streams and customer-facing businesses that allow them to market their online services with signage within their stores and at the checkout counter. And WMT especially has one of the world's great logistics systems. The key sentences in the article could be these: \nBased on a Market Track study of holiday circulars, Wal-Mart is offering an average discount of 39 percent, compared with 35 percent last year. At Target, the price cuts grew to 38 percent from 36 percent. It is serious. And it can afford to do what it takes. Worse for retail investors, the entire industry is talking about this problem. The article explains: \n\"With the lines between traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce continuing to blur, the need to make a big splash during large retail events like Black Friday is significant,\" Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, said in an e-mailed statement. \"The ease of comparison shopping across channels is creating a situation that puts a definitive advantage in the consumers' hands.\" When customers get the advantage, that's bad for the vendor. Especially when the P/E is close to 200X. Some additional color from the article: \nWal-Mart and others also are steering customers toward online deals, rather than just physical stores. While the chain still offers Black Friday specials at its supercenters, the day marks the beginning of a streak of online promotions called \"Cyber Week.\" Wal-Mart has tripled its e-commerce selection to 23 million products this year, aiming to better compete with Amazon. \nTarget, meanwhile, is offering 15 percent off almost everything in its stores and website for two days: Sunday and Monday. The aggressive discounts come at a cost. When Target slashed prices last holiday season, its profit margin slipped to 27.9 percent from 28.5 percent. The mention that WMT is upping its product selection so much means, again, that it's serious about its Jet.com acquisition. WMT will cease its buyback program and slow its dividend increases to a minimal level, if needed, to avoid having AMZN eat its lunch. Moving beyond competition, there's a different aspect of AMZN's business practices that has always troubled me. That comes out in this news item: Does AMZN really think it can be everywhere that's sexy? The Motley Fool titles a current article with this report: \nAmazon Is Serious About Taking On Netflix I'll skip the details, which you may well know better than I. Presumably there's a pot of gold in the streaming business somewhere, someday, but maybe not yet. The article spills the beans on a circular part of what AMZN does so well to keep the image of endless growth opportunities going. It asks the question that I always ask about AMZN and then answers it: \nCan Amazon make money directly from Instant Video? \nAmazon has never had any pressure to generate a profit directly from Instant Video because it served to support Prime. Not only do a higher percentage of Prime trial members who use Instant Video sign up for a full year than those who don't, but members who use it throughout the year are more likely to renew. With Prime members spending around twice as much as non-members, Amazon can afford to lose money on Instant Video to support the rest of Prime. \nAmazon has already taken steps to move Instant Video into a stand-alone service. Customers can sign up for just video streaming for $8.99 per month. That price still undercuts Netflix's $10 per month, but it represents a slight price increase compared with Prime's regular $99-per-year service. The pricing reflects two concerns: that Instant Video on its own is a loss leader for Prime, and that churn could be a much bigger factor for the monthly subscription. Is everything a loss leader for everything else at this company? I actually do not think it's quite that bad, because Amazon Web Services is a top-notch enterprise, but it devours capital and may never end up paying dividends to shareholders. And I'm sure that AMZN is trying hard to generate sustainable profits. The real problem, I believe, is that just being the preferred site from which people begin their online shopping does not provide much of a moat. The mention of AMZN chasing Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ) is relevant also because of how they are lumped together by the Street. While I see them as cutting each other's throats to the benefit of consumers but the detriment of shareholders, the Street apparently disagrees... The entire sector is treated as if it's the late '90s all over again From Seeking Alpha , Nov. 23, a blast-from-the-past title: \nOppenheimer & Co. bullish on valuations at Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Netflix It's a serious article. Indeed, it links to a thefly.com article that indeed uses the word \"valuation\" to describe the stocks. Facebook (NASDAQ: FB ) is certainly a marvelous company. Maybe its valuation will work out. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) is a reasonable pick. But Netflix , with AMZN and others now coming after it, is not a stock with an attractive valuation. It's a stock with a 1999-type valuation: hope. I would think that Oppenheimer (NYSE: OPY ) would know better. And then there's AMZN, with analysts giving optimistic views of the valuation of AWS and even more optimistic views of the value of the distribution business. AMZN is not at an attractive valuation. The investment case for it is that despite an unattractive valuation, it will overcome the competition and innovate new products, new distribution methods, improvements to brick-and-mortar stores, etc. that eventually will lead today's high valuations to look acceptable. Technicals are deteriorating, and President Trump is no friend of AMZN AMZN has begun to underperform a rising market. As of the close Friday, it is being rejected from below by a falling 50-day EMA. For a stock with this P/E and this P:S as a retailer, which has beaten the S&P 500 (NYSEARCA: SPY ) by about 10 points over the past 52 weeks and by over 120 points over the past two years, any underperformance and rejection by a falling short-term moving average is a cause for concern. Another issue to consider is the comments that the president-elect has made about AMZN while on the campaign trail. That relates to AMZN as a business. I would add to that the fact that Mr. Bezos controls the Washington Post newspaper, and harshly criticized Mr. Trump during the campaign. It does not help a stock to have an adversary as POTUS. Conclusion AMZN was a classic bubble stock in the second half of the '90s. Here we go again. It's a classic bubble stock again, modified because it's much larger, has important mindshare with consumers, and has a real business with some moat in AWS. But AWS has tons of longer-term uncertainties and requires huge cash investments in physical assets. Then, we do not know how profitable (or not) the Kindle/Fire/Echo etc. devices are, and we know that AMZN's basic distribution business is facing growing competition that is now serious about the task. This competition has larger profit streams, well-established national and international distribution networks, the advantage of physically seeing its customers very frequently, and now has a common purpose, to cut AMZN down to size. Add to all that the fact that Wall Street is still addicted to bubble stock market reports. Then add to that the expectation that the recounts in some states will not change the ultimate selection of Donald Trump by the Electoral College as president, and that he may not be all that friendly to AMZN while in office. Then add a decelerating uptrend in the stock following massive outperformance and I would simply conclude by saying that a neutral observer would think there is more risk than reward in this stock. Maybe booming business will go on forever, but the P/E and other metrics are so high for AMZN that I'd rather keep missing the move up if that's what's coming, and simply enjoy the show.

      "text": "Television critic Glenn Garvin used to eagerly await the annual crop of Christmas movies and TV shows. Who can resist watching dull little Bedford Falls transformed into the glorious, neon-lit hookers-and-pawnshops urban landscape of Pottersville in It's A Wonderful Life? Whether it was yuletide zombies, ill-mannered Norwegians, or a jolly Santa Claus blasting Satan in the butt with a cannon, he was endlessly enchanted.\nBut those days have passed. Today's children being the overprotected little snowflake dorks they are, Christmas shows for them are nightmarish descents into robotic multicultural tedium that make Garvin long for the bony embrace of the best Ghost of Christmas Future ever in Mr. Magoo's Christmas Carol .\nAmazon Prime has appointed itself the Official Network of Christmas Lobotomization this year, releasing three heinous little shows that parents can prop their kids (or, possibly, tie them down) in front of as they join the Black Friday throngs overrunning shopping malls. Garvin explains more.\nView this article. \n",

      "text": "November 25, 2016 at 03:07 AM EST Amazon in Talks to Acquire Souq.com Friday, November 25, 2016 Amazon in Talks to Acquire Souq.com According to reports from Bloomberg, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) is interested in acquiring Dubai-based online retailer Souq.com. Talks originally centered around the Seattle-based tech giant taking an ownership stake of approximately 30%. This quickly expanded to talks of acquiring the whole company for a price tag somewhere around $1 billion. Sources were quick to point out discussions are still only preliminary in nature, and could fall apart at any time. Souq.com is actively seeking out at least a minority investor, hiring Goldman Sachs to find it a partner back in September. Current institutional investors Tiger Global Management and Naspers Ltd. are reportedly weighing any potential sale as a chance to sell their stakes in the e-commerce site. Souq.com is active in the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia, selling about 1.5 million products across 31 different categories. As a privately held company, we don’t know much about its financial details, but it does call itself the largest online retail and marketplace platform in the Arab world. If Amazon wanted to make a splash in the Middle East, buying Souq would be a good start. Amazon is investing aggressively into international growth. It recently rolled out its Prime subscription service to customers in both China and India, and the company seems poised to really start investing heavily in Amazon Video, which would further intensify its rivalry with Netflix. Amazon shares are virtually unchanged during Friday’s slow post-Thanksgiving trading, falling $0.05 each, a decline of 0.01%.",

      "text": "Email \n(CNN) — An ornament being sold on Amazon is receiving some unique criticism because of its political nature. \nThe product — which is now listed as “currently unavailable”— is a “Make America Great Again” hat ornament. The hat won notice during the Donald Trump presidential campaign — with Trump himself wearing the headgear on many occasions over the course of his White House bid. \nHowever, the ornament’s reviews on Amazon have become somewhat of a sounding board and venting outlet for critics of the President-elect. \n“Came with an entire crate of white hood ornaments. Great bargain! Downside: My tree is now on fire,” a user under the name Shaenon K. Garrity posted. \nAnother Amazon user wrote, “It was really strange. Once I put it on the tree, the message on it changed.” \nHowever, not all comments were critical. \n“Made my Christmas tree great again!” wrote one user who gave the product five stars. \nAs of Thursday afternoon, the product had 1.3 stars out of 5 from customer reviews.",

      "text": "Amazon Black Friday deals include 40 percent off diapers today Simplemost.com 2:30 PM, Nov 25, 2016 40 mins ago Previous Next \nBoth Huggies and Babyganics have great deals on diapers today — Huggies is offering 40 percent off and Babyganics is offering 70 percent off. \nHuggies has a 20 percent off diapers coupon on Amazon, plus an additional 20 percent off from Amazon Family when you “Subscribe and Save.” So if you need any diapers or know a friend or family member who might need some, then you should read this and take advantage of the deal. \nRead this story and more at Simplemost.com \nThe 20 percent coupon stacks on top of the Amazon Family (formerly known as Amazon Mom) 20 percent Subscribe-and-Save discount. So when you add these two together, diapers are 40% off! \nAs shown in the Amazon Shopping Cart screenshot below, the original price is $37.09, the 20 percent coupon saves $7.42 and the 20 percent for Amazon Family saves $7.42. The total savings is $14.84, which is a savings of 40 percent. Here’s the final price for a box of diapers when added to your cart.",

(Photo credit :LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images) × Amazon unveils Cyber Monday deals A picture shows the logo of the online retailer Amazon dispalyed on computer screens. (Photo credit :LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images) \nNEW YORK – Black Friday sales are still going on, but Amazon has unveiled some of its deals for Cyber Monday. \nThe online retailer will roll out more than 75,000 sales starting Monday and throughout the week on a variety of products, including toys, electronics, video games and books. \nWhile electronics tend to be big sellers on Cyber Monday, Amazon said that so far this holiday season, the “most-watched deal” has been the Mermaid Tail Blanket. \nAmazon’s own products will also be on sale on Monday: The voice-controlled Echo speaker will be priced at $139.99 and the Tap Bluetooth speaker will be $89.99. Both sale prices match what the company offered as part of its Black Friday sales. \nCyber Monday is a big sales day for Amazon. Last year, shoppers ordered more than 54 million items — 629 per second — on the Monday after Thanksgiving. \nAmazon Prime members, who pay $99 a year, will get early access to Lightning Deals. There will also be specific deals for shoppers using Alexa, the voice assistant in Echo. \nHere’s a look on what will be on sale Monday: \n–50-inch 1080p LED TV for $145 \n–50-inch 4K Ultra HD Smart TV for $249.99 \n–Amazon Voyage for $169.99 \n–Amazon Fire TV for $74.99 \n–Sonos PLAY: 1 compact wireless speaker for $149 \n–Nest Cam indoor security camera for $163.98 \n–Up to 50% off select Nerf, Playskool and Play-Doh toys \n–Blendtec Total blender for $239.99 \n–Up to 50% off select Callaway Golf sets ",

If so, then check out Amazon's Black Friday 2016 deal on the Motorola Moto G4 and Moto G4 Plus . The retailer is selling the new affordable Moto G4 series at up to 25% below the usual retail prices. Those on a very tight budget might be interested in the ad-subsidized 16GB Motorola Moto G4, which is priced at just $129.99 ($20 or 13% off). The 32GB variant of the ad-subsidized model is priced at $139.99 ($40 or 22% off). If you're not willing to cope with Amazon's ads on the lock screen and a bunch of pre-loaded Amazon apps, you'll have to get a non-subsidized variant. The 16GB Moto G4 model is priced at $179.99 ($20 or 10% off). Fortunately, Amazon's biggest discount is on the 32GB version without ads, which currently costs $174.99 ($55 off or 24%).

      "text": "Though Amazon ( AMZN ) has grown to become a retail colossus largely on the back of giant internal investments, acquisitions have played an important and underappreciated role.\nGenerally, the purchases have involved firms that have carved out leading positions in growing niches -- whether in terms of products, geography or sales model -- and for which Amazon would have to expend a lot of time and money to replicate what the acquired firm has accomplished.\nAn acquisition of Middle Eastern online retailer/marketplace Souq.com would fit with this objective. And the timing of the deal would mesh well with reported plans for a major expansion of Prime Video's global footprint.\nSources tell Bloomberg Amazon is \"considering a bid\" to buy Souq, an 11-year-old company occasionally referred to as the \"Amazon of the Middle East,\" for about $1 billion. It adds, Souq initially wanted to sell \"a stake of at least 30 percent,\" and had hired Goldman to find stake buyers. Existing Souq investors such as Tiger Global Management, which invested in Souq earlier this year through a funding round reportedly featuring a $1 billion valuation, are also said to be thinking about selling shares.\nGiven the details surrounding the situation, it's possible sources close to Souq are trying to drum up interest in the company's share-sale efforts by giving the impression Amazon is ready to swoop in. And intensifying competition may have management and investors feeling this is a good time to partly or fully cash out: It was only a couple weeks ago that a $1 billion Middle Eastern e-commerce venture backed by Saudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund was announced.",
