Goldman Sachs told clients the recent rally in cyclical stocks will continue even after last week's election surge due to Donald Trump's economic policies. \n\nThe Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF is up 5 percent from Tuesday's close through Friday, while the Financial Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF rose 8 percent.\n\n\"Looking forward, cyclicals outperformance should persist,\" strategist David Kostin wrote in the note to clients Friday.\n\n\"Tax and trade reform appear to be high priorities for President elect Trump. Cyclical stocks that should benefit most will have high domestic sales, sizeable profits held overseas that may be repatriated, and/or high corporate tax rates.\" \nKostin said that during the campaign, Trump proposed $1 trillion in fiscal spending over the next decade. More fiscal spending will \"lift nominal GDP growth and lead to higher sales and earnings,\" according to the strategist. He cited how Goldman's basket of cyclical names already outperformed the firm's defensives basket by more than 10 percentage points in the last six months. \nHere are five cyclical stocks Goldman recommends with large international earnings repatriation potential.",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs: Trump's Policy Mix Poses Risks for Global Economy",
      "text": "Goldman Sachs: Trump's Policy Mix Poses Risks for Global Economy \nPresident-elect Donald Trump (AP) Monday, 14 Nov 2016 07:00 AM Close A A \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's policy mix could prove an overall negative for the world economy, according to an analysis by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. \nGoldman analysts cite Trump's promised combination of fiscal stimulus, trade tariffs, stricter immigration rules and higher interest rates. \nWhile developed economies could get an initial boost from a U.S. fiscal stimulus package, the impact would quickly fade and spillovers into emerging markets are negative, Goldman said. \n\"Our analysis suggests that Mr. Trump’s policies might act as a modest drag on global growth,\" the Goldman economists wrote. \"A larger fiscal package could boost global growth moderately more in the near term, but a more adverse policy mix would likely act as a significant drag on world growth in subsequent years.\" \nIn theory, a burst of U.S. government spending has positive spillovers. Stronger U.S. demand would also boost purchases of foreign goods and services. A likely stronger dollar would also help developed economies with floating exchange rates, though gains for emerging markets would be more limited. \n\"The spillovers to China, for example, depend on the extent to which the renminbi appreciates with the dollar and the net effects are less positive for emerging market economies that rely heavily on dollar-denominated debt,\" Goldman economists led by Jan Hatzius said in a research note dated Nov. 13. \nIt's the combination of Trump's policy mix where the real risks lie. The president-elect has floated the need for import tariffs as high as 45 percent on goods from China. A promised immigration crackdown and preference for a more hawkish Federal Reserve would all likely have negative spillovers for the rest of the world. \n\"The growth drag is generally muted for developed market economies with floating exchange rates but significantly negative for some emerging market economies including China,\" said Goldman. \nTo be sure, judging the impact of Trump's promised policy mix depends on how much campaign rhetoric translates into government policy. For now, though, there are clear worry points for a global economy that's already struggling for growth traction. \n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News. All rights reserved.

      "text": "President-elect Trump's transition team has reportedly recommended Steven Mnuchin, Trump's campaign finance chairman and a former Goldman Sachs banker, for the post of treasury secretary.\nFar from an outsider, Mnuchin, who runs a hedge fund, would come into the office bringing extensive associations with one of the most politically-connected Wall Street firms, as well as with Hollywood.\nTrump has not yet announced a decision. On Monday morning, however, his campaign manager Kellyanne Conway reportedly told reporters outside Trump Tower that an announcement regarding Trump's selection for treasury secretary could come as early as this week.\nBloomberg first reported Monday that the transition team has recommended Mnuchin, one of several names that had been floated regarding the job.\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Mnuchin would be the second Goldman Sachs alumnus treasury secretary in a decade, following George W. Bush secretary Hank Paulson, and the second straight under a Republican.\nTrump ran for president promising to \"drain the swamp,\" meaning decrease special interest influence in Washington. In the days since winning the presidency, however, he has indicated a course of policy more amenable to the financial industry.\nYet any nominee with a background in finance is likely to face tough scrutiny during the Senate nomination process, especially from liberal Democrats who have hinted that they will oppose such nominees.\n ",

And we've already got the long term implications all worked out? Really? I don't think so. (To be fair to GS, clients are asking for this sort of research. Crazy.) Along similar lines, here's Reuters recap of Kaplan's comments earlier. The headline says it all: Too early to tell impact of Trump policies: Fed's Kaplan Quite.  ",

      "text": "In Politics by Jamie Peck   @jamie_elizabeth \nLast week, there was some speculation that Donald Trump meant to ask JP Morgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon to be the U.S. Treasury Secretary , despite the fact that he didn’t want the job. Now Bloomberg News reports that former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. partner Steven Mnuchin is the transition team’s top pick, as had been earlier speculated. \nBloomberg News reports that two sources “familiar with the process” say the prominent capitalist is the transition team’s top pick for the job. This would make sense, as Mnuchin threw in with Trump early and helped him raise millions of dollars as finance chairman of his campaign. After amassing a fortune of over $40 million via his position at Goldman Sachs, he left the investment banking firm and took his money to Hollywood, where he has produced big budget films like “Suicide Squad” and the “X-Men” franchise. \nAssuming Mnuchin gets the job, his appointment will represent one more departure from Trump’s populist rhetoric. While Trump gained middle class support by pledging to take on Wall Street and the political establishment, it doesn’t get much more establishment than Mnuchin, who would be the third ex-Goldman executive to fill the post since the mid-1990s (one under Clinton, and one under Bush II). As Bloomberg points out, his resume reads like a parody of everything Trump voters hate, right down to his involvement in the 2009 foreclosure crisis \nVia Bloomberg : \nBefore joining Trump, Mnuchin rose through the kind of elite institutions the president-elect spent his campaign vilifying. Mnuchin was tapped into Yale’s Skull and Bones secret society, became a Goldman Sachs partner like his father before him, ran a hedge fund, worked with George Soros, funded Hollywood blockbusters and bought a failed bank, IndyMac, with billionaires including John Paulson. They renamed it OneWest, drew protests for foreclosing on U.S. borrowers, and ultimately generated considerable profits, selling the business last year to CIT Group Inc. for $3.4 billion. \nOn the upside, he’s probably no worse than Hillary Clinton’s secretary of the treasury would have been, which is more than we can say of some Trump appointments . \n[Photo: Getty]",

      "text": "\nResearch Team at Goldman Sachs, suggests that the USD strength in recent days can extend and see the US election as something of a “reset.” \nKey Quotes \n“As early signs of a Trump victory made their way into the markets during the night from Nov. 8 - 9, the Dollar fell in line with this pattern, but reversed sharply as President-elect Trump began giving his acceptance speech, which projected a conciliatory and inclusive message. This set off a rally in risk, which has morphed into markets trading a positive growth shock to the US: Dollar up, inﬂation breakevens up and SPX up.” \n“Amid substantial uncertainty, our US team has kept is growth forecast unchanged. There is upside risk from the ﬁscal stimulus, while there is downside risk from an escalation in protectionism.” \n“But in either case, inﬂation is likely to be higher than before, which is what has probably helped drive inﬂation breakevens up. As a result, market pricing for Fed hikes has risen sharply, with tightening priced through Sep. 2019 now 86 bps, almost a full hike more than at points before the election. Our point here is not that risks don’t exist. Of course they do. Instead, it is that the policy mix has shifted in the direction of more inﬂation, which means that – given how dovish market pricing has been – there is room for the Dollar to catch up with where it should have been quite some time ago. Our US team forecasts three hikes next year in addition to the one now likely in December. This is more than double what is priced and underpins our forecast for the Dollar to rise around 7 percent on a trade-weighted basis over that horizon.” \n“There are three additional issues of note. First, the Dollar is driven by two-year rate differentials, so the December meeting is clearly important. Our US team has emphasized ﬁnancial conditions, which are moving in favor of a hike. Second, the inﬂation story is really something unique to the US, but if we look at trade-weighted inﬂation breakevens, US inﬂation has yet to break meaningfully above that elsewhere.” \n“The inﬂation picture in Europe and Japan is difﬁcult, so the market is not yet pricing this correctly. This translates in our minds into more Dollar upside. Finally, there is China. The prospect of more Dollar strength may obviously see the $/CNY ﬁx move higher. But our best guess is that moves will be at the modest end of the spectrum, given that failure to do so could antagonize the incoming US administration. It might be time for the CFETS basket to go up a little bit, which would set things off on a good foot in Washington come January.” RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nThe surprise outcome of the U.S. presidential election may have spurred a rally in Britain's pound, but that's not likely to last long, Goldman Sachs said in a note on Monday. \n\"The U.S. presidential election's outcome has been positive for the British pound , which appreciated even against the U.S. dollar. But, the election of Mr. Trump has not changed our bearish view on sterling,\" it said, sticking with a forecast for the pound to fall to $1.20 by year end, with the euro fetching 90 pence. \n\"The recent appreciation of sterling makes the entry point into a short pound trade more compelling,\" it said, adding the fallout from Brexit will be \"extensive.\" \nThe pound climbed to as high as $1.2673 in the wake of President-elect Donald Trump 's surprise win in the U.S. election, from levels under $1.24 before the results. The pound was fetching $1.2470 at 2:02 p.m. HK/SIN. \nSterling's strength against the greenback came even as the dollar index , which measures the U.S. currency against a foreign-exchange basket, rose to its highest in 11 months. \nThe euro was fetching 86.16 pence at 2:07 p.m. HK/SIN, down from levels above 89 pence before the results. \nThe pound likely strengthened due to expectations that Trump could pursue a \"fast-track\" trade deal with the U.K., Goldman noted. \nBut it added, \"at this stage, we have no reliable information on the stance that the new U.S. administration will have vis-a-vis Brexit.\" It noted that the U.K. would be unable to sign a trade deal with the U.S. until it formally left the EU. \nTo exit the EU, the U.K. must invoke Article 50 of the treaty, which starts a two-year negotiation period for the terms of the separation process. Chris Ratcliffe | Bloomberg | Getty Images \n\"The political uncertainty linked to the process of leaving the EU and renegotiating trade agreements is and will likely remain elevated for long,\" it said. \"The process has not even begun and, when Article 50 is triggered, uncertainty is set to increase even more: for some time it will remain unclear what kind of deal the EU and the U.K. will agree upon.\" \nGoldman expected Brexit would spur an economic slowdown as the uncertainty reduces investment, employment and consumption. \nIt noted that the U.K. legal case currently underway could make the road to Brexit even more complicated and it was likely to increase sterling's volatility over the next 12 months. \nThe U.K.'s Supreme Court was likely to rule next year on whether the government needed parliamentary approval before invoking Article 50, Reuters reported earlier this month. \nThat followed a decision by a lower court, the High Court of England and Wales, in early November that parliament had to make the decision, Reuters reported. That ruling had helped to support the pound. \nBut Goldman remained pessimistic of the likely outcome. \n\"Even if the case could delay the date on which Article 50 is triggered, we believe the decision increases the likelihood of a general election in 2017 and of a stronger 'pro-hard Brexit' Parliament thereafter,\" it said. \"The road to 'hard Brexit' negotiations has become bumpier, but has not been blocked. Nevertheless, the level of overall uncertainty around the process has increased.\" \n—By CNBC.Com's Leslie Shaffer; Follow her on Twitter @LeslieShaffer1 \nFollow CNBC International on Twitter and Facebook .",

      "text": " Investors didn't want to own bank stocks in the \"unclear environment\" before the presidential election took place last Tuesday, but that's changed now that we know Donald Trump is the next president, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) President Gary Cohn said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Tuesday afternoon.\n\"We all understood that people were looking to own assets that they felt were protected in an unclear environment,\" Cohn noted. \"As we're starting to create more clarity or perceive more clarity, people are starting to migrate toward those asset classes that they think may benefit in more clarity. Banks are one of those.\"\nIn this more transparent environment, investors are beginning to move money out of technology names and into bank, drug and industrial names, but time will tell how things settle, he said. \"The truth is we're going to have to wait and see to what we actually end up with and what we get in the future.\"\nCohn is \"excited\" about the bank's future, he said. \"As we get greater transparency and greater clarity of what the environment is going to look like, what the economy is going to look like, and what's going on in the global world, our clients are going to be more propelled to do different things.\"\nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author.",

      "text": "Markets Today Goldman Sachs (GS) President Cohn Says Banks Benefiting from 'More Clarity' Investors are pulling money out of tech names to invest in sectors that are seeing a post-election boost, such as banks, Goldman Sachs (GS) President Gary Cohn said. Natalie Walters Nov15,20161:38PMEST \nNEW YORK ( TheStreet ) -- Investors didn't want to own bank stocks in the \"unclear environment\" before the presidential election took place last Tuesday, but that's changed now that we know Donald Trump is the next president, Goldman Sachs ( GS ) President Gary Cohn said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Tuesday afternoon. \n\"We all understood that people were looking to own assets that they felt were protected in an unclear environment,\" Cohn noted. \"As we're starting to create more clarity or perceive more clarity, people are starting to migrate toward those asset classes that they think may benefit in more clarity. Banks are one of those.\" \nIn this more transparent environment, investors are beginning to move money out of technology names and into bank, drug and industrial names, but time will tell how things settle, he said. \"The truth is we're going to have to wait and see to what we actually end up with and what we get in the future.\" \nCohn is \"excited\" about the bank's future, he said. \"As we get greater transparency and greater clarity of what the environment is going to look like, what the economy is going to look like, and what's going on in the global world, our clients are going to be more propelled to do different things.\" \nSeparately, TheStreet Ratings objectively rated this stock according to its \"risk-adjusted\" total return prospect over a 12-month investment horizon. Not based on the news in any given day, the rating may differ from Jim Cramer's view or that of this articles's author. Prev 0 of 2 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "title": "John Weinberg, Ex-Goldman Executive, Takes a Top Post at Evercore",
      "text": "Until last year, John S. Weinberg was a top corporate adviser at Goldman Sachs , a high-powered executive at the firm where his family built a banking dynasty. Now, he is moving to a newer Wall Street firm, taking one of its most senior posts. The investment bank Evercore Partners said on Wednesday that it had hired Mr. Weinberg as its executive chairman and chairman of its board. Roger C. Altman, a co-founder of the firm and its current executive chairman, will take the new role of senior chairman, while Ralph L. Schlosstein will remain chief executive. “I am excited because this is an organization that has done an extraordinary job of focusing on clients,” Mr. Weinberg said in a telephone interview. Mr. Altman added: “We take a very long-term point of view with clients. I don’t know a single banker over my years who better epitomizes that ethos — who isn’t at Evercore — than John.” Mr. Weinberg’s hiring is one of the most prominent by the 21-year-old firm. The Weinberg name has long been closely tied to Goldman Sachs, ever since Sidney J. Weinberg rose from a spittoon cleaner at the firm in the early 1900s to the chief executive who made the bank one of the most powerful on Wall Street, leading the initial public offerings of Sears and Ford Motor. \nAdvertisement   Weinbergs have been at Goldman ever since, including John S. Weinberg’s late father, John L. Weinberg, and late uncle Sidney Weinberg Jr. Still, members of the family have gone to work elsewhere in the financial world. One of Mr. Weinberg’s cousins, Peter A. Weinberg, previously served as Goldman’s head of Europe — and subsequently helped found the boutique investment bank Perella Weinberg Partners. John S. Weinberg spent 32 years at Goldman, becoming a partner in 1992, eventually becoming a co-head of its investment bank and, finally, a vice chairman of the firm. During his tenure, he advised the likes of Ford, where he is a director; General Electric; and Visa. Now he’s joining Evercore, which has become one of the most prominent independent investment banks, dispensing advice but forgoing the lending and trading operations of traditional firms like Goldman or JPMorgan Chase. Still, over the years Evercore has grown to 28 offices across the globe, with research and wealth management arms in addition to its core advisory operations. The firm ranks 10th among merger advisers so far this year, having worked on 144 deals worth $254 billion, according to Thomson Reuters. Among the transactions it helped with are Qualcomm’s $39 billion takeover of fellow chip maker NXP Semiconductor and Samsung’s $8 billion acquisition of the audio company Harman International. And it has been one of the best-performing independent investment banks, its stock having risen 19 percent this year. Evercore shares closed on Tuesday at $64.35, valuing the firm at nearly $3 billion. Evercore had long been led by Mr. Altman, a veteran deal maker at Lehman Brothers who has also been immersed in Democratic politics, including as deputy Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration. He co-founded the firm in 1995 after leaving Washington. Evercore’s leadership began to change seven years ago, when Mr. Altman brought in Mr. Schlosstein, a veteran financier and co-founder of the asset management giant BlackRock , as chief executive. Still, Mr. Altman has remained involved in many of the firm’s biggest transactions. \nAdvertisement   Mr. Weinberg said in the interview that when he retired from Goldman last summer at the age of 58, he had no intention of decamping to a rival and instead wanted to evaluate his career options. “I wanted to go back to work, but I only wanted to go back to work at an organization that had the values and principles that I could really get behind,” he said. One of the earliest and most persistent sets of suitors were Mr. Altman and Mr. Schlosstein, who pitched him on Evercore as a corporate adviser with a deep focus on client relationships. “When we had the opportunity to speak with him and attract him to the firm, it was literally a no-brainer,” Mr. Schlosstein said.

      "text": "Donald Trump may nominate for Treasury Secretary a Goldman Sachs banker whose biggest patron was George Soros. Alternatively, he could opt for the top bank lobbyist in D.C.\nTrump's pledge to \"drain the swamp\" appears headed for the same fate as President Obama 's promise eight years ago to end the reign of the special interests and \"end the game-playing\" in D.C.\nIn all corners of his transition team and his planned executive branch, President-elect Trump is placing lobbyists and Wall Street insiders. He's not draining the swamp — he's hiring the swamp creatures.\nSteve Mnuchin was a Goldman Sachs banker who started his own investment firm seeded with money from George Soros. He then made huge profits by buying a failed bank off the government with help from a special tweak by regulators.\nWhen Trump tapped Mnuchin as his campaign's finance chairman, commentators noted the irony of a populist candidate railing against Wall Street and the elites while leaning on this Goldman-born-and-bred Yale alumnus to rustle up the funding for the whole operation. If the Goldman connection is too rich for Trump, he will have to go further down his depth chart, which the New York Times says includes former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty.\nPawlenty quit Mitt Romney's campaign six weeks out from the 2012 election to take over the Financial Services Roundtable, a K Street lobbying operation whose members include Bank of America, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Wells Fargo, and General Electric.\nPawlenty, in this role, has lobbied for renewing the charter of the Export-Import Bank, a federal agency that subsidizes exporters and their lenders—and which Trump has said he opposes. Putting a corporate-welfare lobbyist for the biggest banks atop Treasury doesn't really count as \"draining the swamp.\"\nRudy Giuliani is the frontrunner to be Secretary of State, media reports say. Apparently, if there's anything this past election taught us, it's that the voters want a baby-boomer liberal New Yorker tied up with lobbyists, shady foreign actors, and bankers to push an aggressive globalist foreign policy from Foggy Bottom.\nGiuliani had his name on a lobbying firm up until 2016. While the former mayor was a named partner at Bracewell & Giuliani, the firm grew its lobbying from $4.7 million the year before he joined to a peak of $8.7 million in 2010. The firm's clients in Giuliani's decade there included Duke Energy, Bluefire Ethanol, the Council of Industrial Boiler Owners, and the Airborne Tactical Advantage Company.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Energy bill in limbo in lame duck Congress is back, but an energy bill languishing in its chambers for nearly a year may have to wait until next year.\nBy John Siciliano • 11/16/16 12:01 AM The boiler owners weren't Giuliani's most noteworthy corporate client. Marxist terrorist organization Mujahideen-e Khalq (MEK) also paid \"America's Mayor\" to advocate for the group, pleading on Capitol Hill and at Foggy Bottom to pull MEK off the list of foreign terrorist organizations, Josh Rogin reported in the Washington Post this week .\nGiuliani Partners, Rudy's other consulting venture, represented drugmaker Purdue before federal agencies regarding painkiller OxyContin, the New York Times reported in 2007.\nPete Hoekstra, the former congressman from Western Michigan, is a contender for a senior intelligence or Homeland Security job, according to various news reports. Hoekstra operates a lobbying and consulting firm, Hoekstra Global Strategies. Lobbying filings indicate Hoekstra lobbies Congress on tax credits for an energy company and federal contracts for a helicopter company.\nJeffrey Holmstead is a lobbyist at Bracewell LLP (they dropped Giuliani's name at the beginning of the year) is on the short list for the Environmental Protection Agency, according to the Times. Holmstead has been a lobbyist for nearly a decade. Liberals blast him for representing \"polluters,\" but one of his clients, Duke Energy, was lobbying for mandatory climate caps late last decade while Holmstead represented them.\nCorey Lewandowski and Newt Gingrich were in the early running for administration jobs, though early press reports suggest internal opposition. Lewandowski was an earmark lobbyist during the early days of the Tea Party. Gingrich was an unregistered lobbyist for government-backed mortgage-bubble-inflator Freddie Mac, for drug companies seeking Medicare subsidies, and for the ethanol industry.\nAlso from the Washington Examiner Media find bigotry in Trump's first adviser Bannon is viewed by most mainstream news outlets as a dangerous extremist.\nBy Eddie Scarry • 11/16/16 12:01 AM Trump defends this K Street bonanza by saying it was unavoidable: \"The whole place is one big lobbyist,\" he explains. That excuse may be an accidental admission: His promises to reform Washington, to storm the castle, were promises he couldn't keep.\nTrump was always right about the corruption in Washington. He may prove himself clueless in how to uproot it. Or worse, he may just be fine with it after all.\nTimothy P.

      "text": "By Evan Peterson Nov 16, 2016 Read more: GFLC 2016 \n\nGoldman Sachs President Gary Cohn has a straightforward way of describing what has been an unorthodox year for global economics and politics. \n“I would characterized 2016 as the year of unpredictability.” \nBetween growth in China, up and down oil prices, interest rates around the world, Brexit and the U.S. election, it has been difficult for financial decision makers, political leaders and market participants to get a hold on how to manage the risk. The latest swing post-election is in the bond market, where prices have dropped since Donald Trump was elected. \n“The environment is dying for stability and predictability,” says Cohn. “The market is hanging their hat on Trump saying certain things.” \nIn a discussion at the Global Financial Leadership Conference, Cohn also shared his thoughts on what the Federal Reserve has in store, and how the influence of the Fed has changed in the years since he joined Goldman Sachs in 1990. \n“We have a global growth issue and we’re trying to solve it with domestic policy and it won’t work,” he said. \nSince the economy is now global and the Federal Reserve’s policies are intended to address domestic monetary issues, they are often insufficient, according to Cohn. \n“It’s a global monetary policy, and there’s only so much the Fed can do. When you’re the Fed, you look at the data that says you should raise rates, but there are other considerations. What will it do to the dollar, and how will that affect other currencies and monetary policies?” \nHe acknowledged that the Fed is limited to using its traditional tools to spur growth, even if that is insufficient to address global issues. \n“The Fed is in a really tough position because they are only one piece of the global puzzle.” \nIn his conversation with CME Group Executive Chairman and CEO Terry Duffy, Cohn took a tour of some other issues facing global markets, including: \nBrexit: “I think the U.S is going to be a huge beneficiary of this.” “When in doubt, move to the safest and soundest jurisdiction in the world, which is the United States right now.” \nBonds: “In many respects, the perceived clarity the market thinks they’re getting, is leading people to believe we’re going into a higher rate, greater growth environment. People perceive more clarity than they did a week and a half ago.” \nChina: “Long term we continue to be very bullish on China,” Cohn said of Goldman \nHe added that China has executed on all their five, ten and fifty year plans: They’ve moved rural people to cities, built infrastructure, and created a consumptive population. “They know realistically that it’s going to take another generation of people to take people from the country, move to the city and spend money. It’s not the parents spending, it’s the next generation.” \nUnited States: “I’m bullish on the U.S. Europe is the place I’m most concerned. China, the U.S. and the rest of the world, kind of look interesting to me.” \nCyber security: “We’re all inextricably linked and dependent on each other. In the cyber world, the bad men and women of the world are looking when to pull the trigger.” \nEvan Peterson Evan Peterson is director of corporate marketing at CME Group and managing editor of OpenMarkets.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., is shown in this 2015 file photo. In this Aug. 30, 2016 file photo, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. speaks outside a polling station after voting, in Phoenix. \nNEW YORK -- In his Manhattan high-rise, President-elect Donald Trump met Tuesday with Vice President-elect Mike Pence as he worked to fill key posts in his Cabinet. But the transition team appeared to be straining under the challenge of setting up a new administration. \nFormer U.S. Rep. Mike Rogers, a respected Republican voice on national security issues, announced he was quitting the transition effort. And an apparent clerical oversight held up the Trump team's ability to coordinate with President Barack Obama's White House. \nTrump himself broke with protocol Tuesday night by leaving Trump Tower without his press contingent. The transition team had told reporters and photographers there would be no movement by the president-elect for the rest of the day and night, but less than two hours later a presidential-style motorcade rolled out of the building, suggesting that Trump was on the move and leaving reporters scrambling. \nTrump turned up at Club 21, a midtown Manhattan restaurant where he was having dinner with his family. Reporters were not allowed inside. \n[ TRUMP: Timeline of president-elect’s career + list of appointments so far ] \nA short time later, a tweet appeared on Trump's account: \"Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\" \nIn a statement Tuesday, Rogers, who as a congressman from Michigan led the House Intelligence Committee, said he was \"proud of the team that we assembled at Trump for America.\" And he said he was \"pleased to hand off our work\" to a new transition team led by Pence. \nTwo individuals with direct knowledge of the issue said Rogers was pushed out of the team. \nIn addition, a transition official said Tuesday that Trump had removed a second senior defense and foreign policy official from his transition team -- Matthew Freedman, who runs a Washington consulting firm that advises foreign governments and companies seeking to do business with the U.S. government. \nFreedman, who had been in charge of coordinating Trump's calls to world leaders after his election, is a former business associate of Paul Manafort, Trump's former campaign manager. \nPence, now running the transition team, ignored questions from reporters as he entered Trump Tower, a thick binder tucked under his arm, and as he left six hours later. He took over from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who spent months running transition operations before his demotion last week. \nSome efforts were frozen, senior White House officials said, because Pence did not until Tuesday night sign legally required paperwork to allow his team to begin collaborating with Obama's aides on the handover. Christie had signed the document, but Pence's promotion makes it invalid. By law, the document must be signed by the chairman of the transition operation or his designee. \nAmong other things, the paperwork serves as a mutual nondisclosure agreement for both sides, ensuring that members of the president-elect's team do not divulge information about the inner workings of the government that they learn during the transition period, and that the president's aides do not reveal anything they may discover about the incoming administration's plans. \nBrandi Hoffine, a White House spokesman, said the administration was waiting on more documents required by law before agencies could begin sharing information with the transition team. Those documents include a list of all transition team members and certification that they meet a code of conduct barring conflicts of interest. \nA person familiar with the transition efforts said different factions in Trump's team \"are fighting for power.\" \nA number of Christie allies have been told they were no longer in line for top posts, according to several people familiar with the transition, who spoke on condition of anonymity to speak candidly. \nA former U.S. official with ties to the Trump team described the ousters of Rogers and others as a \"bloodletting of anybody that associated in any way on the transition with Christie\" and said that the departures were engineered by two Trump loyalists who have taken control of who will get national security posts in the administration: retired Lt. Gen. Michael Flynn and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. \nIndeed, Trump effectively created two power centers in his White House even before taking office. He named Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus as his chief of staff and media executive Stephen Bannon as his chief strategist, but called them \"equal partners.\" Kushner is also deeply involved in the transition, creating another layer of uncertainty about who is making decisions. \n'jobs as lollipops' \nThe disarray caught the attention of some senior Republicans who criticized Trump during his campaign but said after he won that they would not necessarily rule out joining his administration or advising him. \nFormer GOP national security official Eliot Cohen blasted Trump's team on Twitter, calling them \"angry, arrogant.\" Cohen opposed Trump during the campaign, but in recent days, he said those who feel duty-bound to work in a Trump administration should do so. But he said Tuesday that after an exchange with Trump's team, he had changed his recommendation to \"stay away.\" \nCohen, who last week had urged career officials to serve in Trump's administration, said in an interview that a longtime friend and senior transition team official had asked him to submit names of possible national security appointees. After he suggested several people, Cohen said, his friend emailed him back in terms he described as \"very weird, very disturbing.\" \n\"It was accusations that 'you guys are trying to insinuate yourselves into the administration ... all of YOU LOST.' ... it became clear to me that they view jobs as lollipops, things you give out to good boys and girls,\" said Cohen, who would not identify his friend. \nCohen also said the transition official was \"completely dismissive\" of concerns raised about Trump's appointment of Bannon, whom Trump's advisers have strongly defended. \nHis friend's email conveyed the feeling that \"'we're so glad to see the bicoastal elites get theirs,'\" added Cohen, who described the response as \"unhinged.\" \nWith Trump out of sight for several days, his allies engaged in an unusual round of public speculation about his potential appointments -- including their own futures -- as the president-elect and his aides weighed the nation's top national security posts. \nFormer New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani seemed to be angling for secretary of state. But Trump's transition team was reviewing Giuliani's paid consulting work for foreign governments, which could delay a nomination or bump Giuliani to a different position, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about it. \nGiuliani founded his own firm in 2001, Giuliani Partners, and helped businesses on behalf of foreign governments, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela. \nGiuliani defended his 15 years in the private sector as a credential for the job. \n\"I have friends all over the world,\" Giuliani said in an interview. \"This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world.\" \nSen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Giuliani's fitness for the job, pointing to his list of paid speeches, his work for foreign governments and his support for the Iraq War. \nA Trump official said John Bolton, a former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, remained in contention for secretary of state. \nSen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama, a Trump ally and immigration hard-liner, is said to be a contender for defense secretary, along with U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., and Flynn. \nRetired neurosurgeon Ben Carson, who has been a confidant to Trump since the end of the Republican primaries, said he is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser. \nRussia 'reset' ripped \nAlso on Tuesday, perhaps the most influential Republican on national security matters, Arizona Sen. John McCain, weighed in on Trump's efforts to work with Russian President Vladimir Putin, saying any efforts to \"reset\" relations with Russia are unacceptable. \n\"With the U.S. presidential transition underway, Vladimir Putin has said in recent days that he wants to improve relations with the United States,\" the Senate Armed Services Committee chairman, who had a difficult relationship with Trump during the campaign, said in a statement released by his office. \n\"We should place as much faith in such statements as any other made by a former KGB agent who has plunged his country into tyranny, murdered his political opponents, invaded his neighbors, threatened America's allies, and attempted to undermine America's elections,\" he said. \nThat development followed a telephone call Monday between Trump and Putin, during which they agreed that relations between their countries were \"unsatisfactory\" and vowed to work together to improve them, the Kremlin said in a statement. \nIn his statement, McCain pointed out that Russia, in support of Syrian President Bashar Assad, resumed large-scale bombardment Tuesday in Syria. \n\"The Obama administration's last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin's invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,\" McCain said. \"At the very least, the price of another 'reset' would be complicity in Putin and Assad's butchery of the Syrian people.\" \n\"That is an unacceptable price for a great nation. When America has been at its greatest, it is when we have stood on the side [of] those fighting tyranny,\" McCain added. \"That is where we must stand again.\" \nAnd Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., proposed that Congress hold a series of hearings on \"Russia's misadventures throughout the world\" -- including whether they were involved in cyberattacks to disrupt the U.S. elections. \n\"Here's what I would tell Republicans: We cannot sit on the sidelines as a party and let allegations against a foreign government interfering in our election process go unanswered because it may have been beneficial to our cause,\" Graham added. \nInformation for this article was contributed by Ken Thomas, Julie Pace, Jonathan Lemire, Jill Colvin, Josh Lederman, Robert Burns and Erica Werner of The Associated Press; by Julie Hirschfeld Davis, Eric Lipton, Adam Goldman, Ashley Parker, Mark Landler, Jo Becker and staff members of The New York Times; by Jerry Markon, Karen DeYoung, Greg Miller, Andrew Roth, Robert Costa, Elise Viebeck and Jenna Johnson of The Washington Post; and by Lisa Mascaro of Tribune News Service. \nA Section on 11/16/2016 Print Headline: Hiccups slow Trump's team ADVERTISEMENT",

      "text": "7 Biggest Price Target Changes For Tuesday \nJuniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR )'s Switching product could drive a re-acceleration in the company’s top- and bottom-line growth into 2017, and lend “meaningful upside to estimates,” Goldman Sachs’ Simona Jankowski said in a report. She maintains a Buy rating on the company, while adding the stock to its Conviction List. \nAnalyst Jankowski mentioned that the 12-month price target of $31 reflected 19 percent upside, which is likely to result from upside to EPS estimates as well as multiple expansion. Product Cycle \nThe main upside to Juniper is likely to be driven by Switching , which represents 17 percent of the company’s sales estimate for 2016. Jankowski noted that the Goldman Sachs estimate for Switching was currently almost $100 million, or 10 percent, higher than the consensus expectations. \n“Juniper’s new switching products expand its TAM in the high growth data center switching segment, where it can gain share from Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: CSCO ) and compete with Arista Networks Inc (NYSE: ANET ). Juniper has already seen good traction (QFX up 50 percent yoy in 3Q). With the last QFX product out in 4Q we expect switching growth to accelerate,” the analyst wrote. \nJuniper’s deferred product revenue growth has accelerated significantly from 24 percent year-over-year in the past two quarters to 42 percent in the current quarter. “Our analysis shows product deferred is a leading indicator to sales, implying meaningful upside to the next 2 quarters,” Jankowski stated. \nJuniper recently reported upbeat Q3 results and raised its guidance for Q4. \nImage Credit: By LPS.1 (Own work) [CC BY-SA 3.0], via Wikimedia Commons Latest Ratings for JNPR",

      "text": "Black Coral Research Summary \nWith the election of Donald Trump, it seems all but certain that the Dodd Frank Act will not survive in its current form. \nGoldman Sachs, with its heavy reliance on trading revenues, will be one major beneficiary of this action. \nGoldman will also benefit from Trump’s planned ‘21st Century Glass-Steagall’ since it could force rivals like Bank of America and JPM Morgan to abandon their trading desks. Analysis In the aftermath of Donald Trump's surprise election victory, financial stocks have rallied, with Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) picking up over 16%. The impetus for Goldman's (and the broader financial sector's ) rally is the idea that Trump's administration will introduce a friendlier climate for banks, particularly as Trump's election platform has now become policy. Indeed, according to Trump's website, the \"Financial Services Policy Implementation team will be working to dismantle the Dodd-Frank Act and replace it with new policies to encourage economic growth and job creation.\" Dividend and Outlook Investors who hold $10,000 worth of Goldman shares for a year can expect around $127 in passive income, for a yield of 1.27%. This is around 90-basis points lower than yield of the S&P500 and is among the lower yields of its peer group, which has an average yield of 2.68%. Nonetheless, the real attraction of Goldman in the post-election environment is in the capital gains it can provide now that its biggest bugbear, the Dodd-Frank Act, may be put out to pasture. Dodd-Frank was born in the aftermath of 2008 financial crisis and was meant to prevent (or at least forestall) the onset of a similar crisis, with an emphasis on protecting consumers from predatory loan practices and preventing banks from assuming risks that could destabilize themselves and, consequently, the financial system. In particular, banks have chaffed under the Volcker Rule , which prevents banks from making speculative investments that do not benefit its customers. Loosely interpreted, this has been considered a de facto ban on proprietary trading and has been met with sharp resistance from Wall Street's biggest players. In fact, as recently as late August 2016, Goldman, Morgan Stanley (NYSE: MS ) and JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ) led banks in seeking a five-year deferment from the Federal Reserve on the implementation of the Volcker rule. The Trump victory - and the declaration that the Implementation Team would seek to dismantle Dodd-Frank would seem to preclude the need for such an extension. Moreover, one of Trump's choices (some have called him Trump's preferred choice ) for Treasury Secretary is Steven Mnuchin , a former Goldman Sachs partner. Meanwhile, Trump's senior adviser Steve Bannon is a former Goldman Sachs Vice President. We've mentioned these two Trump administration connections because it means that whether or not the 'dismantling' of Dodd-Frank actually happens , Goldman will have influential voices in the new administration - particularly as it relates to Goldman's investment banking practice, which makes us 19% of its net revenues. Just how important is proprietary trading to Goldman Sachs? A look at its latest 10-Q shows that its \"Market Making\" and \"Other Principal Transactions,\" which are essentially trading revenues totaled nearly $3.9 billion in the third quarter out of its $8.17 billion in net revenues. A portion of Goldman's net interest income likely comes from accruals related to its holdings of interest-bearing securities such as Treasuries, but for simplicity, we're excluding this from our count. Nonetheless, Goldman's proprietary trading operations likely accounts for north of 47.4% of its net revenues. Trading operations make up an outsized portion of Goldman's revenues because, unlike a regular bank, it doesn't really derive revenues from the traditional lending products (commercial loans, credit cards and mortgages) that rivals like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) and JP Morgan. In fact, prior to September 2008 (i.e. during the heart of the financial crisis), Goldman wasn't even a bank holding company . What's more, Goldman only recently began entertaining the idea of operating a retail banking operation . This is another area where the Trump victory also helps Goldman Sachs at the expense of its rivals. How so? President-elect Trump has called for a '21st Century' Glass-Steagall Banking Law. The original Glass-Steagall Act constituted four parts of the U.S. Banking Act of 1933 and is remembered for its separation of Commercial and Investment Banking. The former is something that Goldman doesn't really pursue with vigor - deposits only accounted for around $125 billion of its $792 billion in liabilities (or 24.6% of its total) through the third quarter of 2016 - or less than the $195 Billion it owed to its trading counterparties and the $191 Billion it owed to unsecured lenders during this period. In contrast, a more traditional bank such as Bank of America had deposits accounting for 64% of its total liabilities while trading accounted for less than 15% of its net revenues. A 21st Century Glass-Steagall could result in institutions like Bank of America, JP Morgan, Citigroup (NYSE: C ), Bank of New York Mellon (NYSE: BK ), Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) and others abandoning their trading operations for the relative 'luxury' of vanilla loan products such as commercial loans, credit card lending, mortgages, capital equipment financing and others. Meanwhile, Goldman and Morgan Stanley could return to their earlier incarnations as investment banks first and foremost and rebuild their previously sizable trading operations. Indeed, they would become the undisputed kings on the hill as other Wall Street firms shift their focus elsewhere. The trading businesses of money center banks would be very substantial spin-off entities - it's worth noting that, while Bank of American's trading revenues only accounted for 15% of its revenues, on an absolute basis, the $3.2 billion it earned from its trading operations in the 3rd quarter was not too far off from the $3.9 billion that Goldman earned from trading during the same period. In short, rather than simply winding these trading operations down, money center banks could elect to spin-off their trading operations - or even sell them to parties such as Goldman Sachs, assuming Goldman elects to give up its commercial banking license. This isn't unprecedented - the entity that became Morgan Stanley today was begun by JP Morgan & Co. partners as a result of the original Glass-Steagall Act. What's more, as recently as June this year, Goldman itself sold stakes in several hedge funds as their performance waned - and also because the Volcker rule would have required the sale down the line anyway. One other thing that a Trump victory has done is heighten market volatility . In the short-term, that is beneficial to financial institutions that actively trade - among other things, market making is lucrative when bank clients have exposures that they'd like to hedge and the occasional rush to sell also generates significant commissions. While there are downsides to excessive volatility, Goldman has demonstrated an ability to consistently profit from this and we don't anticipate that this cycle will be much different. Conclusion What does all this mean for Goldman? Only that the profit outlook for the company has taken a dramatic shift upwards, which is evidenced by the stock's reaction to Trump's victory. Currently, the earnings growth outlook for the stock over the next five years is 16.6% - a 7 percentage point pick-up from its performance in the previous five years. In our view, if Dodd-Frank is repealed and a new Glass-Steagall act is put in place, Goldman could see its profits grow by 25% to 30% beginning in 2018, as the company doubles-down on its trading operations. Given this, we see Goldman Shares pushing as high as $253.50 per share - a premium to the current consensus target of $183.5. Investors should note that the average target was set prior to Trump's election victory and that analysts were operating under a different set of assumptions - mainly that a Clinton Presidency would likely have maintained Dodd-Frank and been likely to push for the full implementation of the Volcker Rule. That clearly isn't the paradigm today. In the new environment, we anticipate that Goldman could easily see 20% upside from current levels.

      "text": "Tip : Use comma (,) to separate multiple quotes. Learn more... \nWed, Nov 16, 2016, 19:06 GMT - UK Markets closed Goldman Sachs sees Trump leading to more aggressive Fed, 'ambiguous' growth outlook By Patti Domm | CNBC – 22 minutes ago Print Goldman Sachs economists expect Donald Trump's economic agenda to lift inflation and interest rates. \nThey expect to see a more aggressive Fed. They also initially expect higher growth thanks to a Trump plan to spend on infrastructure — bumping their forecast for U.S. GDP growth in the second half of 2017 by a quarter point. \nBut they also described the effect of Trump's economic plans as \"ambiguous.\" While they see a bump in 2017's growth rate, they see the longer term impact of higher tariffs, reduced immigration and tighter Fed policy weighing on growth as a stimulus boost fades. \n\"Markets have traded the Trump victory primarily as a sizable positive growth shock, a small higher inflation shock and a small adverse policy shock (which probably mainly reflects concerns about protectionism),\" the economists said in a report. They see a steady rise in inflation to 2.2 percent, as measured by core PCE (personal consumption expenditure), by 2019. It currently stands at about 1.7 percent. \nThe economists also raised the odds of a December rate hike to 85 percent from 60 percent and said the election of Trump reinforces their view that the Fed will raise rates three times next year. \nThe Fed has forecast two rate hikes for next year, but the Goldman economists said Trump's proposals should \"reinforce the move in inflation that is already underway.\" That and the fact that the current thinking on the equilibrium rate is too low, meaning the Fed could raise the funds rate \"substantially\" more than implied by the markets. \nThey noted that \"aggressive implementation of Trump's trade and immigration policies would likely weigh on growth.\" \nThey trimmed 2019 and 2020 growth by a quarter point. Their current growth forecast is for annualized average U.S. GDP growth of 2.4 percent next year. \nThe economists also said global growth is now accelerating to the top of a 3 to 3.5 percent range it's been in, due to improved financial conditions in the U.S. and emerging world. \n\"The FCI-driven (financial conditions) acceleration in U.S. growth and the Trump-driven change in the growth and inflation outlook reinforce our forecast of tighter Fed policy. We have raised our subjective probability of a hike at the December FOMC meeting from 60 percent to 85 percent, and expect an additional 75 (basis points) of rate increases in 2017. This is above the FOMC's own 50 (basis point) projection because we have a higher core inflation forecast than the median FOMC participant, and also a slightly higher growth forecast,\" they wrote. \nThe tighter Fed policy would pressure global long-term interest rates , they note. That would likely lead the European Central Bank to extend its asset buying program, and the Bank of Japan would likely focus on its own plan to control yield. \nThese diverging policy efforts should put upward pressure on the U.S. dollar, the economists noted. The dollar index has been rising, and it hit a near 14-year high against a basket of currencies Wednesday. \nGoldman economists say the risks around their baseline projections are \"substantial and skewed to the downside.\" \n\"First, the Trump agenda and its effects on the economy are still very difficult to predict with confidence. In particular, greater emphasis on the trade or immigration aspects of the agenda would likely lead to more adverse outcomes even in the shorter term, and the harder-to-quantify effects on policy uncertainty is substantial,\" they wrote. \nThey also noted that the U.S. is not the only country with political risk. They pointed to an uncertain outlook around Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and European Union, as well as the upcoming Italian constitutional referendum. They said more important are concerns that Marine Le Pen could win the presidency of France in the spring. She has toned down her rhetoric but has previously promoted the idea that France should leave the euro. \nThey also added that the stronger dollar could be a risk to emerging economies, particularly China.",

      "text": "\nNew York-based Fintech firm Droit Financial Technologies secured a $16 million in Series A investments earlier this month from Goldman Sachs , Pivot Investment Partners , and Wells Fargo . Principal trading firm DRW also participated. Droit is a New York-based Fintech firm focused on providing enterprise solutions for OTC derivative trading processes. \nThe startup will use the funding to expand its operations globally, including to Singapore, and build its sales, support, and marketing teams. The investment in growth capital will accelerate the company’s real-time decision-making software. Droit focuses on “the business of trading derivatives and use technology to facilitate the process of trading.” The team works with all players in the world of trading, including traders, sellers, middlemen, regulators, and senior managers. It has on-boarded global financial institutions and global regulatory regimes, including Dodd-Frank. \nDroit’s mission is “to provide our clients with robust, enterprise infrastructure facilitating compliant and optimal trading of derivatives across asset classes, regulators, CCP’s and execution platforms.” In layman’s terms, Droit’s trading engine product — ADEPT — aims to bridge the gap between pre-trade proposals and decisions with post-trade compliance in an environment where regulation is a primary concern. The company describes ADEPT as such: \n“The platform ensures that every transaction is executed across jurisdictional guidelines on a timely basis by producing thousands of automated trading decisions per second. Combining finance and computational law, ADEPT also establishes that clients are current with regulations and market microstructure across their entities, counterparties and geographies.” \nFounding Partner and CEO Satya Pemmaraju further explained to Risk.net : \n“At any given point in the day, any active trading firm will need to answer three broad questions: Who can I trade with? What can I trade with this party? Where can I execute and clear this trade? To be compliant with external regulations and internal processes, firms need to be able to answer these questions systematically and consistently across asset classes, execution and clearing platforms, and global regulatory regimes.” \nIn addition to the gap problem, its engine may be able to address other major trading problems , including optimizing trades, choosing counter parties, minimizing grunt work, systematizing experiments, and ensuring seamless integration of all existing trading software. \nManaging Director of Technology at Goldman Sachs Joanne Hannaford commented: \n“Goldman Sachs is pleased to be both a user of and investor in Droit. The company’s success in creating its ADEPT platform gives the company an excellent opportunity to become the industry standard for regulatory-compliant decision engines, and we look forward to our continued cooperation.” \nCEO of DRW Don Wilson said: \n“With more complexity in global market regulation than ever before, Droit’s unique, leading-edge platform automates and standardizes regulatory compliant decision-making, and plays a critical role for market participants.” \nFounding Partner and CEO Satya Pemmaraju and Founding Partner and Head of Product and Strategic Alliances Brock Arnason co-founded Droit in 2012. Earlier this year, Droit won Risk Magazine’s “ Trading Technology Product of the Year “. You may also like... ",

      "text": " count=\"107\" data-total-count=\"107\"> Goldman Sachs , long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks — debt happens. On Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals — even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range — out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan.\nThe c ampaign’s 15- and 30-second video ads , which will appear on Facebook, Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not shameful overspending on unaffordable luxuries. A car gets a cracked windshield while parked at a Little League game. A couch gets chewed up by a new puppy. A child gets new braces. Or a water heater springs a leak.\n“Debt happens. It’s how you get out that counts,” the ads say.\nDustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman’s new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank’s aim was to “destigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.”\nThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple. Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans “can be a better option,” Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research.\n Mr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut.\nThrough the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals.\nGoldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its “vampire squid” reputation.\nPhoto Goldman Sachs will place 15- and 30-second video ads on YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and Hulu for its new service, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. But these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman’s longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets.\n“The real driver” of the new Marcus lending push is “the way the capital rules are,” Goldman’s chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein , said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. “We are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it’s easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,” Mr. Blankfein added.\nThe last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley, which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley’s earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter’s steadier fee-driven revenues.\nAlthough the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010.\nMarcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman’s head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. “We were looking for something different, something new” that wouldn’t compete with Goldman’s existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said.\n Goldman’s growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. “They’ve gone from great to merely good,” said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk.\nGoldman’s push into retail markets also includes getting consumer deposits online , a business that received a lift in April when Goldman bought a $16 billion consumer deposit portfolio from General Electric.\nIt is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. “Digital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,” Mr. Scherr said.\nLending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. “The thing to worry about, when you’re refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,” she said.\nThe small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future.\n“I think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,” said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. “Then three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.”",

      "text": "Foto anzeigen Getty Images\n\nGoldman Sachs economists expect Donald Trump's economic agenda to lift inflation and interest rates. \nThey expect to see a more aggressive Fed. They also initially expect higher growth thanks to a Trump plan to spend on infrastructure — bumping their forecast for U.S. GDP growth in the second half of 2017 by a quarter point. \nBut they also described the effect of Trump's economic plans as \"ambiguous.\" While they see a bump in 2017's growth rate, they see the longer-term impact of higher tariffs, reduced immigration and tighter Fed policy weighing on growth as a stimulus boost fades. \n\n\"Markets have traded the Trump victory primarily as a sizable positive growth shock, a small higher inflation shock and a small adverse policy shock (which probably mainly reflects concerns about protectionism),\" the economists said in a report. They see a steady rise in inflation to 2.2 percent, as measured by core PCE (personal consumption expenditure), by 2019. It currently stands at about 1.7 percent.\n\nThe economists also raised the odds of a December rate hike to 85 percent from 60 percent and said the election of Trump reinforces their view that the Fed will raise rates three times next year.\n\nThe Fed has forecast two rate hikes for next year, but the Goldman economists said Trump's proposals should \"reinforce the move in inflation that is already underway.\" That and the fact that the current thinking on the equilibrium rate is too low, meaning the Fed could raise the funds rate \"substantially\" more than implied by the markets. \nThey noted that \"aggressive implementation of Trump's trade and immigration policies would likely weigh on growth.\"\nThey trimmed 2019 and 2020 growth by a quarter point. Their current growth forecast is for annualized average U.S. GDP growth of 2.4 percent next year.\nThe economists also said global growth is now accelerating to the top of a 3 to 3.5 percent range it's been in due to improved financial conditions in the U.S. and the emerging world.\n\n\"The FCI-driven (financial conditions) acceleration in U.S. growth and the Trump-driven change in the growth and inflation outlook reinforce our forecast of tighter Fed policy. We have raised our subjective probability of a hike at the December FOMC meeting from 60 percent to 85 percent, and expect an additional 75 (basis points) of rate increases in 2017. This is above the FOMC's own 50 (basis point) projection because we have a higher core inflation forecast than the median FOMC participant, and also a slightly higher growth forecast,\" they wrote. \nThe tighter Fed policy would pressure global long-term interest rates , they note. That would likely lead the European Central Bank to extend its asset buying program, and the Bank of Japan would likely focus on its own plan to control yield.\n\nThese diverging policy efforts should put upward pressure on the U.S. dollar, the economists noted. The dollar index has been rising, and it hit a near 14-year high against a basket of currencies Wednesday. \nGoldman economists say the risks around their baseline projections are \"substantial and skewed to the downside.\" \n\"First, the Trump agenda and its effects on the economy are still very difficult to predict with confidence. In particular, greater emphasis on the trade or immigration aspects of the agenda would likely lead to more adverse outcomes even in the shorter term, and the harder-to-quantify effects on policy uncertainty is substantial,\" they wrote. \nThey also noted that the U.S. is not the only country with political risk. They pointed to an uncertain outlook around Brexit negotiations between the U.K. and European Union, as well as the upcoming Italian constitutional referendum. They said more important are concerns that Marine Le Pen could win the presidency of France in the spring. She has toned down her rhetoric but has previously promoted the idea that France should leave the euro. \nThey also added that the stronger dollar could be a risk to emerging economies, particularly China.",

      "text": "Don’t get used to the market surge under Trump, says Bill Gross.  en/265705/trump-trading/ \nBill Gross didn’t vote for Trump or Clinton , but he’s got a message for anyone thinking this post-Trump market surge is the new normal – it won’t last. \n“There is no new Trump bull market in the offing. Be satisfied with 3-5% globally diversified returns. The Wall Street, finance-led hegemon is fading. The populist sunrise has barely broken the horizon,” he said in a note to investors today . \nInvestment banks have been enjoying huge trading volumes since the vote , and the expectation that Trump’s will roll back Dodd Frank regulation has ensured that banks’ stocks have exceeded analyst expectations for the first time since 2009 . \n“I write in amazed, almost amused bewilderment at what American voters have done to themselves,” added Gross. \nScrapping Dodd-Frank would allow banks to prop trade again and, potentially, make the industry “fun” once again . However, dismantling a 2,300-page complex piece of regulation is not simply a good way of allowing banks to spread their wings. \nAdair Turner, the former head of the Financial Services Authority, and Jean-Claude Trichet, the former president of the European Central Bank, have both warned that rolling back the regulation could make the entire banking system much more fragile again. \n“Tighter controls of capital, and particularly capital as it relates to trading book activity, [have been] agreed on at global level… there should be no rollback from that,” said Turner. \nSeparately, senior bankers continue to trade jobs at bulge brackets for boutiques. In the case of John S. Weinberg, who left Goldman Sachs to become Evercore’s chairman, the decision is more surprising because he spent 30 years at Goldman Sachs and his family has a rich history of working there. \nPerhaps it’s a desire to return to the old investment banking model. Back in 2010, as Financial News points out, Ralph Schlosstein – Evercore’s president and chief executive, said it was creating a “throw back bank”, more like the way Lehman Brothers and Goldman Sachs operated in the 1970s.

By: PTI | New York | Published:  10 PM Gupta, 67, is Chairman of the WHEELS Global Foundation (WGF), a nonprofit organisation focussed on applying technology to uplift rural communities and provide technological solutions to global challenges in six areas; water, health, education, energy, lifestyles, and sustainability. (IE) \nIndia-born former Goldman Sachs Director Rajat Gupta has assumed a new role as Chairman of a US-based non-profit organisation, a gradual return to a normal life after completing a two-year prison term on insider trading charges. \nGupta, 67, is Chairman of the WHEELS Global Foundation (WGF), a nonprofit organisation focussed on applying technology to uplift rural communities and provide technological solutions to global challenges in six areas; water, health, education, energy, lifestyles, and sustainability. \nThe non-profit was founded in 2013 by a group of alumni from IIT, all prominent entrepreneurs and financial executives. \nA source told PTI that Gupta assumed the role of Chairman in October this year. \nGupta’s name appears under the list of WGF’s Board of Directors with the title of Chairman on WGF’s web page. \nAccording to his profile on the WGF website, he “serves on its board as a key strategist in defining direction and focus of the non-profit organisation.” It said Gupta brings his “considerable skills to WGF, along with his leadership associations and advisory roles to many other non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.” \nHis profile further adds that the IIT-Delhi and Harvard Business School alumnus and former McKinsey head is a “leading Indian-American businessman and philanthropist” and is “widely regarded as one of the first Indians to successfully break through the glass ceiling, as the first Indian-born CEO of a multinational corporation (not just a consultancy).” \nGupta was one of the highest-profile defendants convicted in the government’s crackdown on insider trading and was sentenced to two years in prison. \nHe served his term in a federal prison in Ayer, Massachusetts and walked a free man in March this year after completing his sentence. \nProsecutors had accused Gupta of passing confidential boardroom information about Goldman Sachs to now jailed hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. \nGupta is still fighting in an appeals court to have his insider-trading conviction thrown out.

      "text": "print \nWarner Bros / San Andreas \nSince Britain voted to leave the European Union, the economy has held up far better than almost every single economist and forecaster predicted. \nOther than the crash in the pound, the doom-laden predictions surrounding immediate recessions and instant massive capital flight that came prior to the vote have failed to materialise, and the UK's economy has shown remarkable resilience. \nMost major forecasters now expect Britain to keep growing despite the Brexit turmoil, and for any recession to be avoided (with the notable exception of Barclays). \nAmong those forecasters is Goldman Sachs — which initially predicted a recession in the UK in the event of a Leave vote, but has since rowed back, and now expects steady, if lower than pre-Brexit, growth. \nGoldman released its latest European Economics Analyst note on Wednesday, including a detailed analysis of the bank's forecasts for the coming three years across Europe. Within its analysis, Goldman provides what it calls its \"alternative scenario\" for the British economy going forward. \nThis is essentially a near-doomsday set of circumstances for Britain following a big \"shock to institutional confidence,\" because of Brexit. In the scenario, sterling crashes again, the Bank of England raises rates to 1.25%, and Britain is forced to resort to a brutal deficit reduction programme. As analyst Adrian Paul writes: \"(i) trade-weighted Sterling suffers a one-off 10% depreciation (not dissimilar to the ERM Crisis), (ii) the BoE can no longer ‘look through’ the resulting inflationary consequences (Bank Rate is hiked by a cumulative 100bp over the subsequent year) and (iii) the current Chancellor resorts to the former Chancellor’s pre-referendum plans for fiscal consolidation.\" \nPaul continues: \"A loss of confidence in UK institutions has three implications: (i) the shock to the currency boosts inflation by more than it cushions growth, (ii) the monetary policy impulse turns contractionary and (iii) the fiscal tightening constricts activity.\" \"All in all – notwithstanding a considerable tightening of monetary and fiscal policy – the shock to institutional confidence in our alternative scenario pushes annual CPI inflation to a peak of 3½% in mid- 2018 (compared with a 2.9% peak in our baseline). Three years ahead, the shock implies a level of UK GDP which is 1¾% lower than our baseline, and a price level which is 2% higher.\" \nThe chart below illustrates the potential impacts: \nGoldman Sachs \nGoldman is clear that its alternative scenario is just that, an alternative, and it expects the far more likely \"baseline\" outlook to prevail. In that situation, GDP growth will sit around 2% lower than expected prior to the referendum by the end of 2019. Immediately after the Brexit vote, that number was roughly 2.75%. \n\"To be clear, our baseline outlook for the UK economy (described in the main text), is one in which investor confidence (both foreign and domestic) in the UK’s institutional framework is preserved,\" the note says.",

      "text": "The New World Order (Seeking Alpha) \nGoldman Sachs’ Heather Bellini believes Google Cloud Platform (GCP) “has the technical capabilities and innovative services required to potentially increase market share from 3 percent in CY16 to 13 percent in CY20, becoming the #3 vendor over the next 5-10 years.” \nBellini maintained a Buy rating on Alphabet   ),   $970. \nThe stock had been among the tech stocks that had seen a selloff following the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the United States. \\Where Is The Cloud Going? \nFollowing the hiring of Diane Greene in November 2015, there have been key changes in GCP’s leadership team. Alphabet is also building out the product line for this business segment, as well as its data center footprint. \nIn addition, GCP has achieved key enterprise wins, which Bellini believes demonstrate the commitment of the business to help the migration of enterprises to the cloud. \n  GCP can add 100–400 bps to Alphabet’s revenue growth annually during CY 2017–2020, although it might dilute margins by 30–60 bps during the same period. Market Share \nBellini also expects the company to grow from having 2 percent market share in CY 2015 to 13 percent share in CY 2020 to become the third largest vendor in 2020. \nOn November 15, Alphabet had announced the formation of an artificial group for GCP in an attempt to increase its market share.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs, bank to the elite, makes pitch to the masses Randall Smith SHARES Getty Images \nGoldman Sachs , long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks — debt happens. \nOn Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals — even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range — out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan. \nThe campaign's 15- and 30-second video ads, which will appear on Facebook , Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not shameful overspending on unaffordable luxuries. A car gets a cracked windshield while parked at a Little League game. A couch gets chewed up by a new puppy. A child gets new braces. Or a water heater springs a leak. \nMore from the New York Times: A gay, Latino partner tests Goldman's button-down culture \n\"Debt happens. It's how you get out that counts,\" the ads say. \nDustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank's aim was to \"destigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\" \nThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple . Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans \"can be a better option,\" Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research. \nMr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut. \nThrough the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals. \nGoldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its \"vampire squid\" reputation. \nGoldman Sachs will place 15- and 30-second video ads on YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and Hulu for its new service, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. \nBut these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman's longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets. \n\"The real driver\" of the new Marcus lending push is \"the way the capital rules are,\" Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. \"We are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it's easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,\" Mr. Blankfein added. \nThe last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley , which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley's earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter's steadier fee-driven revenues. \nAlthough the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010. \nMarcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman's head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. \"We were looking for something different, something new\" that wouldn't compete with Goldman's existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said. \nGoldman's growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. \"They've gone from great to merely good,\" said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk. \nGoldman's push into retail markets also includes getting consumer deposits online, a business that received a lift in April when Goldman bought a $16 billion consumer deposit portfolio from General Electric . \nIt is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. \"Digital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,\" Mr. Scherr said. \nLending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. \"The thing to worry about, when you're refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,\" she said. \nThe small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future. \n\"I think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,\" said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \"Then three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.\" Related Securities",

      "text": "Getty Images Goldman Sachs , long the banker to the rich and powerful, has a message for ordinary folks — debt happens. \nOn Thursday, Goldman will introduce its first advertising campaign ever aimed at getting individuals — even those who may barely qualify for credit above the subprime range — out of their higher-cost credit card debt by replacing it with a fixed-rate, lower-cost personal loan. \nThe campaign's 15- and 30-second video ads, which will appear on Facebook , Hulu, Pandora and YouTube, depict debt as an unavoidable nuisance of modern life, not shameful overspending on unaffordable luxuries. A car gets a cracked windshield while parked at a Little League game. A couch gets chewed up by a new puppy. A child gets new braces. Or a water heater springs a leak. \nMore from the New York Times: \nGoldman's online lender, Marcus, opens (to those with the code) \nMeet Marcus, Goldman Sachs's online lender for the \nA gay, Latino partner tests Goldman's button-down culture \n\"Debt happens. It's how you get out that counts,\" the ads say. \nDustin Cohn, the head of brand management for Goldman's new consumer lending arm, Marcus by Goldman Sachs, said the bank's aim was to \"destigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt.\" \nThe ads were created by the digital agency Elephant, whose clients include Twitter and Apple . Marcus is pitching consumers on paying off their credit cards with loans of $3,500 to $30,000 for terms up to six years at average rates of 12 to 13 percent, a few percentage points below typical card rates. Two-thirds of the borrowers are not aware that personal loans \"can be a better option,\" Mr. Cohn said, citing Goldman research. \nMr. Cohn himself is a consumer marketing veteran who, before joining Goldman last year, worked at the underwear brand Jockey International as well as PepsiCo and Pizza Hut. \nThrough the ad campaign, Goldman is peddling itself to the masses in a way it has avoided through much of its 147-year history, during which it primarily focused on advising blue-chip corporations, professional money managers and wealthy individuals. \nGoldman has sold mutual funds through investment advisers since 1989, and last year it introduced a group of exchange-traded funds available to consumers. And it ran corporate-image ads after its initial public offering of stock in 1999, and again starting in 2010 to repair its \"vampire squid\" reputation. \nGoldman Sachs will place 15- and 30-second video ads on YouTube, Facebook, Pandora and Hulu for its new service, Marcus by Goldman Sachs. \n\nBut these days, Goldman is entering new consumer markets as the business environment shifts and new regulations make consumer-oriented businesses potentially more lucrative. Regulators have cracked down on some of Goldman's longtime strongholds, such as trading, and have forced big banks to maintain bigger capital cushions for some assets. \n\"The real driver\" of the new Marcus lending push is \"the way the capital rules are,\" Goldman's chief executive, Lloyd C. Blankfein, said last week at a New York Times DealBook conference. \"We are dissuaded from growing into certain activities that are capital-intensive, and it's easier to grow into other areas that are more favored by the regulators and capital rules,\" Mr. Blankfein added. \nThe last major Wall Street company to try something like this was Morgan Stanley , which merged with the down-market retail brokerage and credit card firm Dean Witter, Discover in 1997. The merger aimed to reduce the market-driven volatility of Morgan Stanley's earnings by balancing it with Dean Witter's steadier fee-driven revenues. \nAlthough the Dean Witter merger set off a culture clash between top executives and bankers, it also prepared Morgan Stanley to pick up the Smith Barney retail brokerage firm from Citigroup a decade later. The result: Morgan Stanley now ranks near the top in retail brokerage business, and the former head of those operations has been its chief executive since 2010. \nMarcus grew out of a companywide review of initiatives begun in 2014 under Stephen M. Scherr, Goldman's head of strategy and chief executive of Goldman Sachs Bank USA. \"We were looking for something different, something new\" that wouldn't compete with Goldman's existing businesses in investment banking, securities trading, money management and merchant banking, Mr. Scherr said. \nGoldman's growth has slowed since its heyday before the financial crisis; its stock has trailed both the broader market and bank stocks since mid-2009. \"They've gone from great to merely good,\" said Mike Mayo, a banking analyst at CLSA. One reason for the slowdown: All big Wall Street companies have slashed their borrowing levels to cut risk. \nGoldman's push into retail markets also includes getting consumer deposits online, a business that received a lift in April when Goldman bought a $16 billion consumer deposit portfolio from General Electric . \nIt is easier for Goldman to grow in this sphere because, unlike other Wall Street giants like JPMorgan Chase , Bank of America and Citigroup, it does not have a big credit card operation against which Marcus would compete. And it does not have to build an expansive network of branches. \"Digital delivery of financial products presented a different opportunity,\" Mr. Scherr said. \nLending to consumers always comes with some risk, said Karen L. Webster, chief executive of Market Platform Dynamics, a payments research consulting firm in Boston. \"The thing to worry about, when you're refinancing people who want to consolidate, is that they may not be your cream-of-the-crop borrower, elevating the risk even further for the lender,\" she said. \nThe small-scale start-up consumer business could prepare Goldman to expand in the future. \n\"I think what Goldman wants to do here is experiment with this, get in-house expertise and see if they can figure out how it works,\" said Chris Kotowski, a bank analyst at Oppenheimer & Company. \"Then three years from now, if some consumer banking business becomes available, they can approach it with a base infrastructure that can be expanded.\"",

      "text": "Forrmer Goldman Sachs Director Rajat Gupta India-born former Goldman Sachs Director Rajat Gupta has assumed a new role as Chairman of a US based non-profit organisation, a gradual return to a normal life after completing a two-year prison term on insider trading charges. Gupta, 67, is Chairman of the WHEELS Global Foundation (WGF), a nonprofit organisation focussed on applying technology to uplift rural communities and provide technological solutions to global challenges in six areas; water, health, education, energy, lifestyles, and sustainability. The non-profit was founded in 2013 by a group of alumni from IIT, all prominent entrepreneurs and financial executives.\nA source told PTI that Gupta assumed the role of Chairman in October this year. Gupta’s name appears under the list of WGF’s Board of Directors with the title of Chairman on WGF’s web page. According to his profile on the WGF website, he “serves on its board as a key strategist in defining direction and focus of the non-profit organisation.” It said Gupta brings his “considerable skills to WGF, along with his leadership associations and advisory roles to many other non-profits such as the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria.”\nIndia vs England Live score\nHis profile further adds that the IIT-Delhi and Harvard Business School alumnus and former McKinsey head is a “leading Indian-American businessman and philanthropist” and is “widely regarded as one of the first Indians to successfully break through the glass ceiling, as the first Indian-born CEO of a multinational corporation (not just a consultancy).” Gupta was one of the highest-profile defendants convicted in the government’s crackdown on insider trading and was sentenced to two years in prison. He served his term in a federal prison in Ayer, Massachusetts and walked a free man in March this year after completing his sentence.\nProsecutors had accused Gupta of passing confidential boardroom information about Goldman Sachs to now jailed hedge fund manager Raj Rajaratnam. Gupta is still fighting in an appeals court to have his insider-trading conviction thrown out.",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs Targets a New Kind of Customer: People in Credit Card Debt",
      "text": "\nIf you’ve racked up some credit card debt—or plan to sometime down the line—Goldman Sachs is looking for your business.\nIn a series of ads that have appeared on platforms like YouTube, Hulu and Pandora, Goldman Sachs is promoting its new line of personal loans—named Marcus, after the bank’s founder—to consumers burdened by credit card debt.\n“Debt happens. It’s how you get out that counts,” according to the ad’s tagline. The commercial depicts expensive mishaps like a water heater leaking or a couch getting chewed up by a new puppy.\nThe bank launched the product last month to a select group of customers with credit scores above 660, sending them a code by mail to apply for unsecured, no-fee loans on Marcus.com to refinance credit card debt and fund household projects, the New York Times reported . The loans can range in amount from $3,500 to $30,000. They can be paid back in terms between two and six years, with average rates of 12 to 13%, a few percentage points below typical credit card rates.\nThe ads are intended to “destigmatize debt and help consumers explore new ways of managing their debt,” a Goldman official told the Times .\nThe Marcus product isn’t the first time the bank—known for focusing on wealthy clients and corporations—has reached out to mainstream customers. In April, it launched an online savings account that lets customers make deposits with as little as $1, with a near-industry-high interest rate of 1.05%.\n \n",

      "text": "  \nMicrosoft stock prices, once a sore point for the company and perhaps the main reason that Steve Ballmer is no longer CEO, have rebounded recently, buoyed by renewed energy introduced by new CEO Satya Nadella and Microsoft’s position as a leader in cloud computing, which is becoming a darling of Wall Street. \nThis morning, financial investment firm Goldman Sachs upped their rating on Microsoft from “hold” to “buy,” and set a target price for the company’s stocks at $68. Microsoft’s stocks have been trading at just under $60, so the target would mean about a 15% upsurge in the company’s value. \nStreetInsider quotes Goldman Sach’s Heather Bellini on Microsoft’s Azure upside: \n“Azure is the #2 market share vendor in the cloud space, and has grown 100% or more yoy eight of the last ten quarters, and in fact growth accelerated in C3Q16. With a large Microsoft customer base and strong C-level relationships, we believe Azure can continue to grow revenue and improve margins over time. Our views are supported by channel partners as well, who have commented recently that they are seeing strong uptake of Azure amongst enterprise customers, particularly as it relates to hybrid cloud,” said Bellini. \nMicrosoft received a strong push from the market after its latest earnings, and continues to do well with Azure, with Office 365, with a changing perception of the company as “the new Microsoft,” and with some good PR coming from its popular Surface line of computers, and even from getting some Linux love. \nGoldman Sachs expects the company to earn $102 billion in fiscal year 2018, and climbing to $111 billion in FY ’19. Do you think good times are ahead for Microsoft?  ",

      "text": "YouTube/Marcus by Goldman Sachs \nGoldman Sachs just ran a series of groundbreaking advertisements. \nThe ads are for Marcus, the firm's first-ever consumer lending platform. It's an online tool that offers fixed-rate, no-fee personal loans of up to $30,000 for two- to six-year periods. \nWhile Goldman Sachs has done brand-focused advertising in the past, this is its first foray into consumer product advertising. \nMarcus is targeted at Americans with more than $10,000 in credit card debt. The ads, below, appear to be geared at middle-class families. The ads are running on Facebook, Hulu, Pandora and YouTube. \nGoldman also launched a digital savings account on GSBank.com in April , offering customers a 1.05% interest rate on their deposits, which can be as little as $1. \nCEO Lloyd Blankfein provided some insight into the firm's push into consumer banking while speaking with The New York Times' Andrew Ross Sorkin at the DealBook Conference last week. \n\"We think we can risk-manage it, we think we can deliver it, and it's a good, relatively safe, relatively low-capital cost business,\" Blankfein said. \"It's a valuable niche for us to fill.\" \nIn an interview last month with Carlyle Group founder David Rubenstein on Bloomberg's recently-launched David Rubenstein Show, Blankfein described the firm's decision to work on its public image in the years since the financial crisis when the bank was dubbed a \" Vampire Squid .\" \n\"I would say in general, we never publicized what we did anywhere,\" Blankfein said of the pre-crisis years. \n\"You never saw Goldman Sachs commercials or advertisements or even our name on our building. After the crisis, we realized that one of the things we didn't do is we didn't communicate enough with the public to let them know who we were and what our contribution was to society.\" \nLooks like that strategy has changed. \nCheck out the ads below.",

      "text": "Shares of Microsoft ( MSFT ) are up more than 1% Thursday after an analyst at Goldman Sachs upgraded the stock to buy from neutral and raised her price target to $68 from $60.\nThe analyst, Heather Bellini, is very smart, said TheStreet's Jim Cramer, co-manager of the Action Alerts PLUS portfolio , on CNBC's \"Stop Trading\" segment.\nThe stock hasn't been that strong lately, Cramer said, but he agrees with Bellini that the company's cloud strategies and initiatives should pay off.\nCEO Satya Nadella is being aggressive in the cloud, and he too is very smart, Cramer commented. Nadella is a good leader making the right moves for Microsoft, he added.\nThis isn't the old Microsoft, Cramer argued. This company is chasing growth , and when its projects get to scale, it should see an increase in margins from its cloud business, Cramer said. Bellini is looking for those moves too, he concluded.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Microsoft ( MSFT ) shares are up $1.07, or 1.8%, at $60.72, after Goldman Sachs ’s Heather Bellini upgraded the stock to a Buy from neutral, and raised her price target to $68 from $60, as part of a mammoth 72-page report on the future of “ public ” cloud computing .\nMicrosoft has a chance to see its gross profit dollars grow at an accelerating pace, and also see improvement in “incremental” profit margins, as a result of Azure’s progress in the cloud, writes Bellini. She and colleague Heath Terry spoke with over a dozen chief technology officers, they write, gauging feedback about Microsoft, and about Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google in cloud, both of which are covered by Terry.\nThe overarching theme is that cloud is still very young but will disrupt overall IT spending in a very big way in the next four years. They see public cloud spending rising from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020. That’s not including traditional software license revenue that Microsoft sells that moves to the cloud.\nOver that time, “we believe the public cloud market will continue to disrupt multiple industries, including servers, storage, networking, infrastructure software, data center construction, and data center outsourcing,” areas that amount to $500 billion in spending now and will be worth $650 billion in 2020.",

      "text": "A blog about business and economics. Nov. 17 2016 3:59 PM Goldman Sachs Is Now Pitching Consumer Loans to Cover Bills and Emergencies. How Depressing. A financial professional works in the Goldman Sachs booth on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange while a television reports airs about the company's lowered stock price April 16, 2010 in New York, New York. Photo by Chris Hondros/Getty Images \nCredit card commercials traditionally center on leisurely, aspirational scenes. A commercial for MasterCard’s Masterpass goes, “Modern life deserves a modern way to pay” as a well-heeled mother, daughter, and the latter’s boyfriend dine at the Cheesecake Factory while making plans to go shoe shopping. Visa is currently promising a free movie ticket as long as you order two others on Fandango. A recent Citi Double Cash card ad shows a young couple sitting with a contractor, planning a home renovation. \nThen there’s Goldman Sachs. In ads debuting Thursday promoting the company’s new consumer-loan division, Marcus by Goldman Sachs , the bank displays a grasp of American reality that appears to elude most of its competitors. The Marcus loans are pitched at people seeking to consolidate credit card debt, offering lower fixed rates on their personal loans. And what, you ask, does Marcus by Goldman Sachs believe has caused people to rack up such bills? Nights out on the town? Designer clothes? No. One commercial shows how borrowing money can help cover the costs of such things as a broken leg, busted water heater, or smashed car windshield. “Debt happens,” the ad proclaims. “It’s how you get out that counts.” Another lingers on a personal calendar with such entries as “electricity bill due” and “tuition due.” Advertisement \nYou know the ugly stats. According to the Federal Reserve, just under half of us could come up with $400 in cash from our own reserves in the event of an emergency. Health care expenses are a leading cause of bankruptcy and remain high, with out-of-pocket costs rising by more than 50 percent since 2010 for people with employer-provided insurance. A majority of students graduating from college in 2016 borrowed money to do so. Household incomes haven’t kept up with the things we cannot live without, and all too many of us are taking advantage of easy credit of the sort offered by Marcus in order to bridge the gap. \nDustin Cohn, head of brand management for Marcus, told the New York Times that one of the campaign’s goals is to “destigmatize debt.” That’s certainly a laudable ambition, especially since so many of us equate an inability to keep up with bills with moral failure . But there’s also something depressing about simply accepting the fact that we’ll need to resort to consumer debt to simply pay the bills. Other countries believe it’s inhumane to assume their citizens have thousands of dollars at the ready, and their safety nets reflect it. But not in the United States, where a study released this week by the New England Journal of Medicine determined that almost 25 percent of people who went to an emergency room in their health insurance network still received bills they did not expect. The average surprise medical bill was more than $900, and the researchers even found one person who got a surprise tab for $19,603. At least these poor souls now have Marcus to help them pay their bills! Get Slate in your inbox. \nAnyway, bully for Goldman Sachs. At least they don’t blame the victim. But shame on us for accepting this state of affairs. \nHelaine Olen is a columnist for Slate and co-author of The Index Card . She is the host of the Slate Academy series the United States of Debt .

      "text": "Goldman Sachs maps out its top ten market themes for 2017 It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but Goldman Sachs Group Inc is already preparing for 2017. PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 18, 2016 8:05 AM \n[NEW YORK] It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but Goldman Sachs Group Inc is already preparing for 2017. In a note to clients on Thursday, a team led by Chief Credit Strategist Charles Himmelberg released its top ten market themes for next year. \n\"High growth, higher risk, slightly higher returns,\" is how the strategists view the year ahead - and it's clear that their outlook has been heavily influenced by the pending regime change in Washington DC. \nHere's a brief summary of each of the ten themes Goldman sees as forming the backdrop for investing in 2017. \nExpected returns: only slightly higher Relative to its 2016 forecasts, the team says owners of financial assets can reasonably able to expect more upside - but stress that these returns will still likely remain low. \n\"The best improvement in the opportunity in global equities is in Asia ex-Japan, where we forecast returns of 12.5 per cent (versus 3.8 per cent for 2016),\" the strategists write. \n\"At the other end of the equity spectrum, in Japan we are forecasting declines of -3.7 per cent on the Topix (versus 5.2 per cent for 2016).\" \nUS fiscal policy: a pro-growth agenda President-elect Donald Trump's focus on infrastructure spending during his victory speech on Nov 9 - rather than trade protectionism or immigration restrictions - catalysed the risk-on sentiment that's pervaded markets, according to Mr Himmelberg. \n\"Markets are starved for growth. This is plainly visible in the eagerness with which markets seized on Trump's growth-focused message,\" he writes. \n\"It is also visible in the speed with which the market's narrative on the economic outlook under Trump has shifted from 'uncertainty' to 'growth.'\" \nFiscal stimulus in the US will help reflate the economy, and stands a good chance of passing through Congress, the team reckons. \nUS trade policy: concerns are likely overdone Goldman doesn't see an imminent trade war on the horizon, and expects any re-negotiation of agreements currently in place (like Nafta) to focus on attempts to improve the prospects for the US manufacturing sector. \n\"We think the popular media narrative on the downside risk of a trade war is overstated,\" the strategist writes. \n\"Our tentative view is that Trump's use of punitive tariffs will be just as pragmatic as President Obama's, albeit more vocal.\" \nEmerging markets risk: 'Trump tantrum' is temporary Emerging market assets have been crushed since the election, as the rise in Treasury yields has reduced the need to reach for yield overseas, and the potential for protectionist trade policies threatens to curtail growth opportunities. \nInvestors are voting with their feet, heading out of EM equity and bond exchange-traded funds in droves. But Goldman doesn't see a continuation of the EM rout as a theme for the year ahead. \n\"We have consistently found that when stronger US growth accompanies higher US rates, EM assets can prosper, especially EM equities and spreads,\" writes Mr Himmelberg. \nTrump and trade: hedge with RMB The president-elect has blasted China as a currency manipulator. Lately, Beijing has done more to keep its currency artificially high than weaken it, using its hoard of foreign reserves to defend the yuan. \nManaged depreciation has been the order of the day for the Chinese yuan: the surprise devaluation in Aug 2015 roiled financial markets, and Goldman's team expects this to continue in 2017. \n\"Our forecasts (US$/CNY at 7.30 in 12 months) call for a depreciation that is well beyond forward market pricing, thereby implying positive gains even accounting for the negative carry,\" the strategist writes. \n\"And beyond the usual reasons for wanting to hedge exposure to 'China risk,' we think it will also hedge the risk of a 'Trump trade tantrum.'\" \nMonetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation to Goldman, the Bank of Japan's move to yield curve control is the canary in the coal mine for a new swath of policy innovations \"that target the intermediary cost of supplying short-term bank credit rather than the market cost of borrowing via long-term public debt\". \nFocusing on that element of the transmission mechanism and moving towards measures like \"funding for lending\" schemes, they argue, is what will have the most impact on real economic activity, chiefly investment. \nBetter-targeted monetary stimulus could help avoid some negative side effects associated with quantitative easing and negative rates that inhibit credit creation, Goldman argues. \nCorporate revenue growth recession: signs of inflection For years, S&P 500 companies have exceeded analysts' expectations on the bottom line more often than the top line during quarterly earnings seasons, as a combination of cost-cutting and shrinking share count, rather than soaring sales, fueled the growth in earnings per share. \nHowever, the strategists \"expect 2017 to confirm that the U.S. corporate sector has emerged from its recent 'revenue recession.'\" \nA firming global economy and recovery in oil prices from their February lows significantly buoys the outlook for revenue growth stateside. \n\"For 2017, our US Portfolio Strategy team expects that modest improvements in the macroeconomic backdrop will help lift S&P 500 operating EPS by 10 per cent to US$116 and they have a year-end S&P 500 target of 2200,\" writes Mr Himmelberg. \nInflation: moving higher across developed markets Market-based measures of inflation expectations in the US have spiked since the election, as traders bet that Donald Trump will be the inflation president. \n\"What seems clear to us, as argued above, is that economic issues, notably tax cuts, infrastructure spending and defense spending, are high on the agenda - a recipe for reflation,\" writes Goldman's team. \n\"We are forecasting large boosts to public spending in Japan, China, the US, and Europe, which should fuel inflationary pressures in those economies.\" \nThe strategists think central bankers in developed nations will be willing to tolerate an overshoot in inflation should that arise, since price pressures have been below their targets for an extended period of time. \nThe next credit cycle: kinder and gentler While commodity-sensitive segments of the credit market have suffered pain in 2016, there hasn't been much in the way of contagion. \nGoldman's team expects more of the same in 2017, with the credit cycle not making a turn for the worse. \n\"Regardless of the state of balance sheet fundamentals, recessions lead to a meaningful acceleration in defaults while expansions keep defaults low. We expect the same playbook in this cycle,\" they write. \n\"The strong 'business cycle' component in the behaviour of high yield defaults, and our view that US recession risk remains low in 2017, leave us comfortable with the view that the inflection point is unlikely to materialise next year, despite the weak state of corporate balance sheets.\" \nThe 'Yellen Call' 2.0: now with 'contingent knock-in'At this time last year, Goldman's team argued that conventional wisdom surrounding the Federal Reserve - that it would work to keep financial assets aloft by easing policy in response to any market turbulence - was moving in the opposite direction. \nNow, an easing of financial conditions would enable the central bank to withdraw policy more expeditiously, ultimately capping the valuation of financial assets. \n\"For 2017, this intuition seems as relevant as ever, especially given that President-elect Trump has promised a material fiscal stimulus,\" writes mR Himmelberg. \n\"A 'contingent knock-in' has been added to the 'Yellen Call' - that is, conditional on a large fiscal stimulus in 2017, the FOMC will be obliged to respond more aggressively to an easing of financial conditions, all else equal.\" \nHowever, Goldman cautions that it's no sure bet that financial conditions will ease in the year ahead, noting the recent rise in bond yields and the US dollar. \nBLOOMBERG ",

Corporate revenue growth recession: signs of inflection \nFor years, S&P 500 companies have exceeded analysts' expectations on the bottom line more often than the top line during quarterly earnings seasons, as a combination of cost-cutting and shrinking share count, rather than soaring sales, fueled the growth in earnings per share. \nHowever, the strategists \"expect 2017 to confirm that the U.S. corporate sector has emerged from its recent 'revenue recession.'\" \nA firming global economy and recovery in oil prices from their February lows significantly buoys the outlook for revenue growth stateside. \n\"For 2017, our U.S. Portfolio Strategy team expects that modest improvements in the macroeconomic backdrop will help lift S&P 500 operating EPS by 10 percent to $116 and they have a year-end S&P 500 target of 2200,\" writes Himmelberg. \n8. Inflation: moving higher across developed markets \nMarket-based measures of inflation expectations in the U.S. have spiked since the election, as traders bet that Donald Trump will be the inflation president. \n\"What seems clear to us, as argued above, is that economic issues, notably tax cuts, infrastructure spending and defense spending, are high on the agenda — a recipe for reflation,\" writes Goldman's team. \"We are forecasting large boosts to public spending in Japan, China, the U.S., and Europe, which should fuel inflationary pressures in those economies.\" \nThe strategists think central bankers in developed nations will be willing to tolerate an overshoot in inflation should that arise, since price pressures have been below their targets for an extended period of time. \n9. The next credit cycle: kinder and gentler \nWhile commodity-sensitive segments of the credit market have suffered pain in 2016, there hasn't been much in the way of contagion. Goldman's team expects more of the same in 2017, with the credit cycle not making a turn for the worse. \n\"Regardless of the state of balance sheet fundamentals, recessions lead to a meaningful acceleration in defaults while expansions keep defaults low. We expect the same playbook in this cycle,\" they write. \"The strong ‘business cycle’ component in the behavior of high yield defaults, and our view that U.S. recession risk remains low in 2017, leave us comfortable with the view that the inflection point is unlikely to materialize next year, despite the weak state of corporate balance sheets.\" \n10. The 'Yellen Call' 2.0: now with 'contingent knock-in' \nAt this time last year, Goldman's team argued that conventional wisdom surrounding the Federal Reserve — that it would work to keep financial assets aloft by easing policy in response to any market turbulence — was moving in the opposite direction. Now, an easing of financial conditions would enable the central bank to withdraw policy more expeditiously, ultimately capping the valuation of financial assets. \n\"For 2017, this intuition seems as relevant as ever, especially given that President-elect Trump has promised a material fiscal stimulus,\" writes Himmelberg. \"A ‘contingent knock-in’ has been added to the ‘Yellen Call’— that is, conditional on a large fiscal stimulus in 2017, the FOMC will be obliged to respond more aggressively to an easing of financial conditions, all else equal.\" \nHowever, Goldman cautions that it's no sure bet that financial conditions will ease in the year ahead, noting the recent rise in bond yields and the U.S. dollar. \n\n© Copyright 2016 Bloomberg News.

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Microsoft ( MSFT ) shares are up $1.07, or 1.8%, at $60.72, after Goldman Sachs ’s Heather Bellini upgraded the stock to a Buy from neutral, and raised her price target to $68 from $60, as part of a mammoth 72-page report on the future of “ public ” cloud computing .\nMicrosoft has a chance to see its gross profit dollars grow at an accelerating pace, and also see improvement in “incremental” profit margins, as a result of Azure’s progress in the cloud, writes Bellini. She and colleague Heath Terry spoke with over a dozen chief technology officers, they write, gauging feedback about Microsoft, and about Amazon ( AMZN ) and Alphabet ’s ( GOOGL ) Google in cloud, both of which are covered by Terry.\nThe overarching theme is that cloud is still very young but will disrupt overall IT spending in a very big way in the next four years. They see public cloud spending rising from $32 billion this year to $137 billion in 2020. That’s not including traditional software license revenue that Microsoft sells that moves to the cloud.\nOver that time, “we believe the public cloud market will continue to disrupt multiple industries, including servers, storage, networking, infrastructure software, data center construction, and data center outsourcing,” areas that amount to $500 billion in spending now and will be worth $650 billion in 2020.",

      "title": "Goldman Sachs maps out its top 10 market themes for 2017",
      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg  34   \nNEW YORK (Nov 18): It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but Goldman Sachs Group Inc is already preparing for 2017. In a note to clients on Thursday, a team led by Chief Credit Strategist Charles Himmelberg released its top 10 market themes for next year. \n\"High growth, higher risk, slightly higher returns,\" is how the strategists view the year ahead — and it's clear that their outlook has been heavily influenced by the pending regime change in Washington, DC. \nHere's a brief summary of each of the 10 themes Goldman sees as forming the backdrop for investing in 2017. \nExpected returns: only slightly higher \nRelative to its 2016 forecasts, the team says owners of financial assets can reasonably able to expect more upside — but stress that these returns will still likely remain low. \n\"The best improvement in the opportunity in global equities is in Asia ex-Japan, where we forecast returns of 12.5 percent (versus 3.8 percent for 2016),\" the strategists write. \"At the other end of the equity spectrum, in Japan we are forecasting declines of -3.7% on the Topix (versus 5.2% for 2016).\" \nUS fiscal policy: a pro-growth agenda \nPresident-elect Donald Trump's focus on infrastructure spending during his victory speech on Nov 9 — rather than trade protectionism or immigration restrictions — catalyzed the risk-on sentiment that's pervaded markets, according to Himmelberg. \n\"Markets are starved for growth. This is plainly visible in the eagerness with which markets seized on Trump’s growth-focused message,\" he writes. \"It is also visible in the speed with which the market’s narrative on the economic outlook under Trump has shifted from ‘uncertainty’ to ‘growth.'\" \nFiscal stimulus in the US will help reflate the economy, and stands a good chance of passing through Congress, the team reckons. \nUS trade policy: concerns are likely overdone \nGoldman doesn't see an imminent trade war on the horizon, and expects any re-negotiation of agreements currently in place (like NAFTA) to focus on attempts to improve the prospects for the US manufacturing sector. \n\"We think the popular media narrative on the downside risk of a trade war is overstated,\" the strategist writes. \"Our tentative view is that Trump’s use of punitive tariffs will be just as pragmatic as President Obama’s, albeit more vocal.\" \nEmerging markets risk: 'Trump tantrum' is temporary \nEmerging market assets have been crushed since the election, as the rise in Treasury yields has reduced the need to reach for yield overseas, and the potential for protectionist trade policies threatens to curtail growth opportunities. \nInvestors are voting with their feet, heading out of EM equity and bond exchange-traded funds in droves. But Goldman doesn't see a continuation of the EM rout as a theme for the year ahead. \n\"We have consistently found that when stronger US growth accompanies higher US rates, EM assets can prosper, especially EM equities and spreads,\" writes Himmelberg. \nTrump and trade: hedge with RMB \nThe president-elect has blasted China as a currency manipulator. Lately, Beijing has done more to keep its currency artificially high than weaken it, using its hoard of foreign reserves to defend the yuan. Managed depreciation has been the order of the day for the Chinese yuan: the surprise devaluation in August 2015 roiled financial markets, and Goldman's team expects this to continue in 2017. \n\"Our forecasts ($/CNY at 7.30 in 12 months) call for a depreciation that is well beyond forward market pricing, thereby implying positive gains even accounting for the negative carry,\" the strategist writes. \"And beyond the usual reasons for wanting to hedge exposure to ‘China risk,' we think it will also hedge the risk of a ‘Trump trade tantrum.'\" Monetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation \nMonetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation \nTo Goldman, the Bank of Japan's move to yield curve control is the canary in the coal mine for a new swath of policy innovations \"that target the intermediary cost of supplying short-term bank credit rather than the market cost of borrowing via long-term public debt.\" \nFocusing on that element of the transmission mechanism and moving towards measures like \"funding for lending\" schemes, they argue, is what will have the most impact on real economic activity, chiefly investment. \nBetter-targeted monetary stimulus could help avoid some negative side effects associated with quantitative easing and negative rates that inhibit credit creation, Goldman argues. \nCorporate revenue growth recession: signs of inflection \nFor years, S&P 500 companies have exceeded analysts' expectations on the bottom line more often than the top line during quarterly earnings seasons, as a combination of cost-cutting and shrinking share count, rather than soaring sales, fueled the growth in earnings per share. \nHowever, the strategists \"expect 2017 to confirm that the US corporate sector has emerged from its recent 'revenue recession.'\" \nA firming global economy and recovery in oil prices from their February lows significantly buoys the outlook for revenue growth stateside. \n\"For 2017, our US Portfolio Strategy team expects that modest improvements in the macroeconomic backdrop will help lift S&P 500 operating EPS by 10% to US$116 and they have a year-end S&P 500 target of 2200,\" writes Himmelberg. \nInflation: moving higher across developed markets \nMarket-based measures of inflation expectations in the US have spiked since the election, as traders bet that Donald Trump will be the inflation president. \n\"What seems clear to us, as argued above, is that economic issues, notably tax cuts, infrastructure spending and defense spending, are high on the agenda — a recipe for reflation,\" writes Goldman's team. \"We are forecasting large boosts to public spending in Japan, China, the US, and Europe, which should fuel inflationary pressures in those economies.\" \nThe strategists think central bankers in developed nations will be willing to tolerate an overshoot in inflation should that arise, since price pressures have been below their targets for an extended period of time. \nThe next credit cycle: kinder and gentler \nWhile commodity-sensitive segments of the credit market have suffered pain in 2016, there hasn't been much in the way of contagion. Goldman's team expects more of the same in 2017, with the credit cycle not making a turn for the worse. \n\"Regardless of the state of balance sheet fundamentals, recessions lead to a meaningful acceleration in defaults while expansions keep defaults low. We expect the same playbook in this cycle,\" they write. \"The strong ‘business cycle’ component in the behaviour of high yield defaults, and our view that U.S. recession risk remains low in 2017, leave us comfortable with the view that the inflection point is unlikely to materialize next year, despite the weak state of corporate balance sheets.\" \nThe 'Yellen Call' 2.0: now with 'contingent knock-in' \nAt this time last year, Goldman's team argued that conventional wisdom surrounding the Federal Reserve — that it would work to keep financial assets aloft by easing policy in response to any market turbulence — was moving in the opposite direction. Now, an easing of financial conditions would enable the central bank to withdraw policy more expeditiously, ultimately capping the valuation of financial assets. \n\"For 2017, this intuition seems as relevant as ever, especially given that President-elect Trump has promised a material fiscal stimulus,\" writes Himmelberg. \"A ‘contingent knock-in’ has been added to the ‘Yellen Call’ — that is, conditional on a large fiscal stimulus in 2017, the FOMC will be obliged to respond more aggressively to an easing of financial conditions, all else equal.\" \nHowever, Goldman cautions that it's no sure bet that financial conditions will ease in the year ahead, noting the recent rise in bond yields and the US dollar.

      "text": "Nasdaq Finds Resistance, But Goldman Sachs Rises Is Goldman Sachs in a profit-taking zone? (EPA/Newscom) Reprints \nU.S. stock indexes crept lower Friday, after the Nasdaq scored a new all-time high but found resistance. \nThe Nasdaq and the S&P 500 each lost 0.3%. The blue chip Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.2%, but the small cap Russell 2000 rose 0.2%. Volume in the stock market today was running higher on the NYSE but lower on the Nasdaq. \nThe Nasdaq briefly touched a new all-time high and then reversed lower. That's a sign that resistance remains at that level. \nBlue chips were mostly down. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) led the upside with a 1% gain. Volume was almost twice its usual pace. Analysts at Macquarie upgraded the stock from neutral to outperform. \nGoldman, a Big Cap 20 stock, is extended 23% from a 172.52 buy point. This puts the stock in the 20%-to-25% profit-taking zone. Many stocks will begin to correct after such a gain. \nDow component IBM ( IBM ) slipped 0.2%, but the chart is showing constructive activity. IBM is adding a handle to a shallow pattern adjacent to another pattern. The new buy point is 161.96. IBM's stock has been struggling for more than two years. \nIBM is undergoing a company transformation. Big Blue has been de-emphasizing its legacy business to focus on cloud computing, analytics, security and mobile computing. \nIn the IBD 50 , a collection of the best stocks in fundamentals and technicals, winners led losers by a 7-to-6 ratio. Sterling Bancorp ( STL ) popped 2.5% in heavy volume. The savings and loan has risen 19% since the Election Day close. \nIn financial news, James Bullard, St. Louis Federal Reserve president, told a conference in Frankfurt, Germany, that he's \"leaning toward\" supporting a December rate hike. Bullard said \"the question now is more about 2017.\" Bullard is a voting member of the Fed. A two-day Fed meeting is scheduled for Dec. 13-14. \nMinutes from the Federal Reserve's early November meeting will be released Wednesday. \nLeading indicators for October were released this morning, matching expectations for a 0.1% gain. The Kansas City Fed Manufacturing Index's November reading came in at 1, vs. 6 in the prior month; the 1.0 score remained above the neutral zero for the third consecutive month. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "Microsoft Stock Upgraded at Goldman Sachs (MSFT) By Richard Saintvilus | November 18, 2016 — 10:33 AM EST \nShares of Microsoft Corporation ( MSFT ) rose as much as 2.17% Thursday, reaching a session high $60.95 on above-average volume after the software giant received an endorsement by analysts at Goldman Sachs. \nOn Thursday, citing strong growth opportunities in cloud computing , Goldman analyst Heather Bellini raised her rating on the software giant to Buy from Neutral. Bellini believes that Microsoft's Azure cloud platform will prosper against competing services by Amazon.com, Inc. ( AMZN ), which was something we noted on Wednesday. (See also: Cloud Computing: An Industry in Exponential Growth .) \n\"We believe the shares are poised to more consistently outperform in the year ahead on the back of sustained traction in its cloud offerings,\" Bellini said in a research note to investors. \"We estimate that Microsoft Azure will contribute $0.94, or 19% of Microsoft's total 2020 non-GAAP EPS of $4.83, and potentially $19 per share (23% of total estimated value).\" \nBellini lifted her price target on Microsoft to $68 from $60. The stock closed Thursday at $60.75, up 1.84%. Based on Bellini's price target, Microsoft can still deliver some 12% returns from current levels. That's not to suggest that the shares are cheap. The stock is priced at a forward P/E of 20 for 2017, which is three points above the S&P 500 ( SPX ) index average. \nAt the same time, a pricey valuation doesn't mean the shares can't still climb, especially when the company is projected to outgrow the average S&P 500 stock in terms of earnings per share . Microsoft shares, which closed Wednesday at $59.65, have risen 9.3% year to date, compared with a 7% rise in the S&P 500 index. The stock has a consensus Buy rating and an average price target of $64. (See also: Elon Musk-Backed AI Startup, Microsoft Ink Cloud Agreement .)

      "text": "Getty Images Federal Reserve Board Chairwoman Janet Yellen does not have a big fan in President-elect Donald Trump. WASHINGTON (MarketWatch) — President-elect Donald Trump has been critical of the Federal Reserve’s easy-money approach and one of his key advisers this week urged the bank to reduce its influence on the U.S. economy. But that’s easier said than done.\nTo combat the Great Recession, the Fed from 2008 to 2014 bought trillions of dollars of U.S. bond and mortgage-backed securities — an investment composed of many individual home loans. The goal: keep the nation’s interest rates uber-low to stimulate growth.\nThe untested and ambitious strategy resulted in the Fed increasing its total assets to $4.5 trillion from just $900 billion in a six-year span. And the central bank succeeded at keeping interest rates low. That may have helped the economy rebound in the years following the end of the downturn in mid-2009.\nRead: After Trump win, Yellen plans to stick around\nYet in the long run the Fed will have to whittle down its balance sheet to more normal levels to allow the economy to function without a crutch. The question is, how to do it?\nEconomists at the prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs tested out several scenarios, but the results were the same. It’s going to take years to unload the vast stores of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has accumulated.\nLet’s say the Fed merely decided to stop reinvesting the interest it earned on its holdings. The effect would be to place about $1.5 trillion worth of securities on the market for private investors from 2018 to 2020. That would be hard for Wall Street to digest, and interest rates might have to rise more than the Fed desires to attract buyers, a negative for the U.S. economy.\nOpinion: Will Trump doom his economic agenda by strong-arming the Fed?\nEven if the approach worked, the Fed’s balance sheet would still be twice as large in 2020 as pre-crisis norms, Goldman calculates.\nTo slim down its balance sheet even faster, the Fed would have to undertake a potentially controversial move by selling off assets, Goldman notes.\nIn that scenario the Fed could lose money — perhaps gobs of money — if forced to sell securities at a discount. The losses would show up by making the annual U.S. deficit higher, drawing a lot of unwanted political and public complaints.\nThe Fed, of course, is mostly shielded under law from political interference. Senior officials — most appointed by President Obama — will determine how and when to reduce the bank’s balance sheet.\nAs is often the case, it’s easier to get into something than it is getting out. For now, the central bank is taking a go-slow approach given considerable uncertainty about the economy’s future path of growth.\n“These are large numbers, which should reinforce the view that any changes to policy around the balance sheet will not happen quickly,” Goldman Sachs said in a report.\nMore from MarketWatch Stop calling stock-market rise a ‘Trump rally’ Is the bond market still smarter than the stock market?

      "title": "This is Goldman’s top trade for 2017 - MarketWatch",
      "text": "Stop me if you’ve heard this one before.\nGoldman Sachs has proclaimed going long the dollar as its top trade for 2017, a decision that might revive unpleasant memories for some of the bank’s clients. Specifically, the bank is recommending investors use the greenback to bet against the euro and British pound.\nThe storied investment bank made a similar call last year, advising its clients to bet that the dollar would rise against the euro and yen. That trade turned out to be a disaster for anyone who took the bank’s advice, as the yen appreciated rapidly in January, sinking the dollar, following the Bank of Japan’s decision to impose negative interest rates on some deposits. By mid-February, the bank had closed out the long-dollar call. The powerful bank’s calls, and their reversals, get a lot of attention. Describing its reach in 2009, a Rolling Stone article likened the investment bank’s reach to “a great vampire squid.”\nGoldman’s top currency strategists have long held on to their view that the dollar will appreciate past the point of parity against the euro, standing by their call even as the Federal Reserve’s reluctance to raise interest rates weighed on the U.S. currency. Goldman argues that the central bank was still miles ahead of its peers in Europe and Asia when it comes to normalizing monetary policy.\nGoldman Sachs This time around, Goldman reasons that President-elect Donald Trump’s plans for tax cuts, infrastructure spending, protectionism and immigration controls will, if implemented, drive up inflation, causing monetary conditions to tighten and the dollar to appreciate.\nMoreover, uncertainty surrounding the terms and timing of the U.K.’s exit from the European Union are likely to weigh on the pound, while a smattering of political risks — including a December constitutional referendum in Italy, as well as elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands next year — will dent the euro.\nUndergirding all of this is the old monetary policy divergence theme. Many expect the Fed to quicken the pace of interest-rate hikes if Trump’s infrastructure spending plan becomes a reality. Markets are already pretty confident that the Fed will move on its second rate hike in a year by twisting the policy dial a quarter-point next month.\nThe biggest risk to this trade, in Goldman’s view, would be a premature tapering of the European Central Bank’s bond-buying program. However, Goldman believes this is unlikely, given the political risks mentioned above.\nGoldman’s strategists expected Democrat Hillary Clinton to prevail in last week’s presidential election. To be fair, so did everyone else.\nFor its second top trade, Goldman recommends betting against the Chinese yuan by using a 12-month dollar-yuan non-deliverable forward.\nThe bank believes that to keep the yuan steady against a trade-weighted basket, the People’s Bank of China will need to allow it to weaken against the dollar.\nGoldman Sachs The dollar strengthened against the euro EU, +0.00% , pound GBPUSD, -0.5798% and the yuan USDCNY, +0.2006% , also known as the renminbi, on Friday. The dollar rose 0.5% to ¥110.74. It was up 0.2% to 6.89 yuan. The euro slid 0.2% to $1.0590.\nMore from MarketWatch Apple MacBook Pro Review: Living With Tradeoffs Giuliani’s Trump-Like Audition for Secretary of State Stop calling stock-market rise a ‘Trump rally’",

      "text": "By Bloomberg / Bloomberg | November 18, 2016 : 4:34 PM MYT NEW YORK (Nov 18): It's not even Thanksgiving yet, but Goldman Sachs Group Inc is already preparing for 2017. In a note to clients on Thursday, a team led by Chief Credit Strategist Charles Himmelberg released its top 10 market themes for next year.\n\"High growth, higher risk, slightly higher returns,\" is how the strategists view the year ahead — and it's clear that their outlook has been heavily influenced by the pending regime change in Washington, DC.\nHere's a brief summary of each of the 10 themes Goldman sees as forming the backdrop for investing in 2017.\nExpected returns: only slightly higher\nRelative to its 2016 forecasts, the team says owners of financial assets can reasonably able to expect more upside — but stress that these returns will still likely remain low.\n\"The best improvement in the opportunity in global equities is in Asia ex-Japan, where we forecast returns of 12.5 percent (versus 3.8 percent for 2016),\" the strategists write. \"At the other end of the equity spectrum, in Japan we are forecasting declines of -3.7% on the Topix (versus 5.2% for 2016).\"\nUS fiscal policy: a pro-growth agenda\nPresident-elect Donald Trump's focus on infrastructure spending during his victory speech on Nov 9 — rather than trade protectionism or immigration restrictions — catalyzed the risk-on sentiment that's pervaded markets, according to Himmelberg.\n\"Markets are starved for growth. This is plainly visible in the eagerness with which markets seized on Trump’s growth-focused message,\" he writes. \"It is also visible in the speed with which the market’s narrative on the economic outlook under Trump has shifted from ‘uncertainty’ to ‘growth.'\"\nFiscal stimulus in the US will help reflate the economy, and stands a good chance of passing through Congress, the team reckons.\nUS trade policy: concerns are likely overdone\nGoldman doesn't see an imminent trade war on the horizon, and expects any re-negotiation of agreements currently in place (like NAFTA) to focus on attempts to improve the prospects for the US manufacturing sector.\n\"We think the popular media narrative on the downside risk of a trade war is overstated,\" the strategist writes. \"Our tentative view is that Trump’s use of punitive tariffs will be just as pragmatic as President Obama’s, albeit more vocal.\"\nEmerging markets risk: 'Trump tantrum' is temporary\nEmerging market assets have been crushed since the election, as the rise in Treasury yields has reduced the need to reach for yield overseas, and the potential for protectionist trade policies threatens to curtail growth opportunities.\nInvestors are voting with their feet, heading out of EM equity and bond exchange-traded funds in droves. But Goldman doesn't see a continuation of the EM rout as a theme for the year ahead.\n\"We have consistently found that when stronger US growth accompanies higher US rates, EM assets can prosper, especially EM equities and spreads,\" writes Himmelberg.\nTrump and trade: hedge with RMB\nThe president-elect has blasted China as a currency manipulator. Lately, Beijing has done more to keep its currency artificially high than weaken it, using its hoard of foreign reserves to defend the yuan. Managed depreciation has been the order of the day for the Chinese yuan: the surprise devaluation in August 2015 roiled financial markets, and Goldman's team expects this to continue in 2017.\n\"Our forecasts ($/CNY at 7.30 in 12 months) call for a depreciation that is well beyond forward market pricing, thereby implying positive gains even accounting for the negative carry,\" the strategist writes. \"And beyond the usual reasons for wanting to hedge exposure to ‘China risk,' we think it will also hedge the risk of a ‘Trump trade tantrum.'\"\nMonetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation\nMonetary policy: focusing the toolkit on credit creation\nTo Goldman, the Bank of Japan's move to yield curve control is the canary in the coal mine for a new swath of policy innovations \"that target the intermediary cost of supplying short-term bank credit rather than the market cost of borrowing via long-term public debt.\"\nFocusing on that element of the transmission mechanism and moving towards measures like \"funding for lending\" schemes, they argue, is what will have the most impact on real economic activity, chiefly investment.\nBetter-targeted monetary stimulus could help avoid some negative side effects associated with quantitative easing and negative rates that inhibit credit creation, Goldman argues.\nCorporate revenue growth recession: signs of inflection\nFor years, S&P 500 companies have exceeded analysts' expectations on the bottom line more often than the top line during quarterly earnings seasons, as a combination of cost-cutting and shrinking share count, rather than soaring sales, fueled the growth in earnings per share.\nHowever, the strategists \"expect 2017 to confirm that the US corporate sector has emerged from its recent 'revenue recession.'\"\nA firming global economy and recovery in oil prices from their February lows significantly buoys the outlook for revenue growth stateside.\n\"For 2017, our US Portfolio Strategy team expects that modest improvements in the macroeconomic backdrop will help lift S&P 500 operating EPS by 10% to US$116 and they have a year-end S&P 500 target of 2200,\" writes Himmelberg.\nInflation: moving higher across developed markets\nMarket-based measures of inflation expectations in the US have spiked since the election, as traders bet that Donald Trump will be the inflation president.\n\"What seems clear to us, as argued above, is that economic issues, notably tax cuts, infrastructure spending and defense spending, are high on the agenda — a recipe for reflation,\" writes Goldman's team. \"We are forecasting large boosts to public spending in Japan, China, the US, and Europe, which should fuel inflationary pressures in those economies.\"\nThe strategists think central bankers in developed nations will be willing to tolerate an overshoot in inflation should that arise, since price pressures have been below their targets for an extended period of time.\nThe next credit cycle: kinder and gentler\nWhile commodity-sensitive segments of the credit market have suffered pain in 2016, there hasn't been much in the way of contagion. Goldman's team expects more of the same in 2017, with the credit cycle not making a turn for the worse.\n\"Regardless of the state of balance sheet fundamentals, recessions lead to a meaningful acceleration in defaults while expansions keep defaults low. We expect the same playbook in this cycle,\" they write. \"The strong ‘business cycle’ component in the behaviour of high yield defaults, and our view that U.S. recession risk remains low in 2017, leave us comfortable with the view that the inflection point is unlikely to materialize next year, despite the weak state of corporate balance sheets.\"\nThe 'Yellen Call' 2.0: now with 'contingent knock-in'\nAt this time last year, Goldman's team argued that conventional wisdom surrounding the Federal Reserve — that it would work to keep financial assets aloft by easing policy in response to any market turbulence — was moving in the opposite direction. Now, an easing of financial conditions would enable the central bank to withdraw policy more expeditiously, ultimately capping the valuation of financial assets.\n\"For 2017, this intuition seems as relevant as ever, especially given that President-elect Trump has promised a material fiscal stimulus,\" writes Himmelberg. \"A ‘contingent knock-in’ has been added to the ‘Yellen Call’ — that is, conditional on a large fiscal stimulus in 2017, the FOMC will be obliged to respond more aggressively to an easing of financial conditions, all else equal.\"\nHowever, Goldman cautions that it's no sure bet that financial conditions will ease in the year ahead, noting the recent rise in bond yields and the US dollar.\nhttp://www.theedgemarkets.com/en/article/goldman-sachs-maps-out-its-top-10-market-themes-2017\n Good Articles to Share >>\n[转贴] 【厨房有什么材料，我们就煮什么菜】 - Harryt30 - Nov 18, 2016 Airbus wins US$1.4 bil order for 13 planes from Japan’s Peach - Nov 18, 2016 Downstream is the future for palm oil industry, says minister - Nov 18, 2016 BMW, Baidu joint project on self-driving cars breaks down - Nov 18, 2016 Brexit no barrier for China's new financial district plan in London - Nov 18, 2016 [转贴] 股所不在，百股齐放! - Harryt30 - Nov 18, 2016",

      "text": "Awards set to expire on Thanksgiving were out-of-the-money Shares of Goldman Sachs have soared since Trump’s victory Share on Facebook \nDonald Trump pulled off more than one Election Day miracle. \nJust last week, it looked like more than 1 million stock options granted to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.’s top executives and directors would expire out of the money. The awards, granted with strike prices of $199.84 at the end of 2006, a solid year for bank stocks, were set to expire on Thanksgiving eve. But on Nov. 7, the night before Americans voted, they closed at $181.48, meaning it wouldn’t make sense for executives to exercise them. \nThen Trump pulled off an upset victory and Goldman Sachs surged 16 percent through Thursday, allowing executives to exercise the options and sell shares to lock in gains. The stock closed at $209.63 on Thursday and traded for as much as $212.07 this week, the highest since July 2015. Financial stocks have been the best performers among 11 major industries in the S&P 500 since the election. \nMichael DuVally, a spokesman for New York-based Goldman Sachs, declined to comment. \nInsiders at the bank sold $205 million of stock since Nov. 8, company filings show. That’s three times more than the group has sold in any month for at least five years, data compiled by Bloomberg show. \nAfter accounting for option exercises, the figures are less impressive. Chief Operating Officer Gary Cohn netted $1.68 million, data compiled by Bloomberg from regulatory filings show. Chief Executive Officer Lloyd Blankfein got $1.18 million and David Viniar, the former chief financial officer and a current board member, received $1.13 million. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal. LEARN MORE ",

      "text": "By Jeffry Bartash, MarketWatch\nReducing Fed's vast bond holdings to take years, study argues\nWASHINGTON (MarketWatch) -- President-elect Donald Trump has been critical of the Federal Reserve's easy-money approach and one of his key advisers this week urged the bank to reduce its influence on the U.S. economy. But that's easier said than done.\nTo combat the Great Recession, the Fed from 2008 to 2014 bought trillions of dollars of U.S. bond and mortgage-backed securities -- an investment composed of many individual home loans. The goal: keep the nation's interest rates uber-low to stimulate growth.\nThe untested and ambitious strategy resulted in the Fed increasing its total assets to $4.5 trillion from just $900 billion in a six-year span. And the central bank succeeded at keeping interest rates low. That may have helped the economy rebound in the years following the end of the downturn in mid-2009.\nRead: After Trump win, Yellen plans to stick around (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/after-trump-win-yellen-says-she-plans-to-serve-out-full-term-2016-11-17)\nYet in the long run the Fed will have to whittle down its balance sheet to more normal levels to allow the economy to function without a crutch. The question is, how to do it?\nEconomists at the prominent investment bank Goldman Sachs tested out several scenarios, but the results were the same. It's going to take years to unload the vast stores of Treasury bonds and mortgage-backed securities the Fed has accumulated.\nLet's say the Fed merely decided to stop reinvesting the interest it earned on its holdings. The effect would be to place about $1.5 trillion worth of securities on the market for private investors from 2018 to 2020. That would be hard for Wall Street to digest, and interest rates might have to rise more than the Fed desires to attract buyers, a negative for the U.S. economy.\nOpinion: Will Trump doom his economic agenda by strong-arming the Fed? (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/will-trump-doom-his-economic-agenda-by-strong-arming-the-fed-2016-11-18)\nEven if the approach worked, the Fed's balance sheet would still be twice as large in 2020 as pre-crisis norms, Goldman calculates.\nTo slim down its balance sheet even faster, the Fed would have to undertake a potentially controversial move by selling off assets, Goldman notes.\nIn that scenario the Fed could lose money -- perhaps gobs of money -- if forced to sell securities at a discount. The losses would show up by making the annual U.S. deficit higher, drawing a lot of unwanted political and public complaints.\nThe Fed, of course, is mostly shielded under law from political interference. Senior officials -- most appointed by President Obama -- will determine how and when to reduce the bank's balance sheet.\nAs is often the case, it's easier to get into something than it is getting out. For now, the central bank is taking a go-slow approach given considerable uncertainty about the economy's future path of growth.\n\"These are large numbers, which should reinforce the view that any changes to policy around the balance sheet will not happen quickly,\" Goldman Sachs said in a report.\n-Jeffry Bartash; 1259ET\n ",

      "text": "SHARES show chapters <p>Goldman: Big moves are ahead for retail socks</p> <p>Goldman Sachs&rsquo; options research team suggests buying options on retail stocks ahead of the holiday shopping season. Is this a smart trade? Dennis Davitt of Harvest Volatility Management and Jonathan Krinsky of MKM Partners discuss with Eric Chemi. </p> Thursday, 17 Nov 2016 | 4:02 PM ET | 05:02 \nLooking for a fun Christmas gift? Perhaps you should consider stuffing some stockings with options on retail stocks. \nIn a note released this week, Goldman Sachs' options research team opined that \"there are significant catalysts for many retail stocks — including high uncertainty around Holiday selling season, preannouncement season for the sector and the ICR XChange Industry conference in January.\" \nYet despite this, \"the options market is pricing in a decline in volatility for many stocks into January,\" the team led by Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote. \nIn other words, options appear to be too cheap. Which, of course, would be a reason to buy them. \nRather than simply buying calls to express a bullish thesis, or puts to express a bearish one, the Goldman team suggests doing both by buying straddles. This is a structure that entails buying both a put and a call with striking prices in line with the stock's current price. If a stocks moves more than the options market is expecting, a long straddle will turn a profit. \nSpecifically, Fogertey and Marshall suggest buying January-expiring straddles on shares of eBay , Under Armour , Nike and Kroger . \nYet Dennis Davitt, a longtime options trader now with Harvest Volatility Management, says that there's a reason the options market is pointing to reduced volatility for retail stocks. Many have seen big spikes in volatility recently. For instance, Under Armour tanked in late October following its earnings report, and Ebay did the same. \nMore generally, the prices of options have dropped across the board lately, now that the much-anticipated presidential election has fallen in into the rearview mirror. \n\"Options are beneficial to buy before periods of volatility when people are not looking at high historical yields,\" Davitt said Thursday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \n\"So it's kind of like, the hurricane has just passed, and now you want to buy insurance on it,\" he added. \"The options were priced for a volatile time, and now they're fairly priced.\"",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 7 hours ago \nIf Goldman Sachs is right, Brexit negotiations will drag on and on and on. How long will banks wait?  en/257425/hard-brexit-london-banking-jobs/ Ominous times ahead \nHow many London banking jobs will disappear after Brexit? Will it be 83,000 as predicted in the ‘private report’ from EY this week? Will it be up to 75,000, as predicted by Oliver Wyman? Or will it be far less under a “soft” Brexit? \nA little-noticed podcast featuring Goldman Sachs’ chief European economist Huw Pill , recorded last week, suggests the pain may be more rather than less. \nIn a conversation with Goldman’s global head of communications, Pill said that while a hard Brexit in the sense of a reversion to World Trade Organization Rules seems self-defeating and unlikely, a soft Brexit in the sense of continued membership of the European single market in any form (including the EEA) looks equally unlikely. Pill didn’t say so, but as the chart below from Deutsche Bank makes clear , this would mean a certain end to the existing-passporting regime that allows banks based in London to operate within the EU. \nUK prime minister Theresa May’s approach to Brexit seems to boil down to three things, said Pill: Legal separation from the EU, control over migration and an end to the European Court of Justice’s jurisdiction over British courts. None of these are compatible with the single market’s indivisible freedoms of goods, people, services, and capital. Nor does Pill think a customs union with the EU is particularly likely: this would necessitate the UK accepting the EU’s edicts on trade negotiations with outside countries in Africa or Asia, something which runs entirely contrary to the Brexit ethos. \nSo what does Pill expect? He doesn’t say exactly, just that: “The most likely outcome is a long, drawn out process where we try find an acceptable point to both sides in the space in between [hard and soft Brexit]. That’s probably not going to be as soft as many people thought in the past.” \nThis doesn’t bode well for banks, which have been asking for clarity on the U.K. government’s plans and a long transition period in which to implement them. Instead, Pill seems to expect a long transition period during which there is no clarity because negotiations are taking place. He doesn’t say so, but banks are likely to use this period of fog to crystallize and implement contingency plans. \nFollowing reports that Goldman is preparing to move jobs to Frankfurt, Goldman Sachs’ CFO Harvey Schwartz said this week that Goldman is still in the contingency planning phase for Brexit and is in no rush to make changes to its European organization. UBS chairman Axel Weber said much the same on Wednesday. However, some banks are already making moves: Citi, for example, is shunting jobs to Dublin. \nPill’s podcast is a timely reminder that Brexit negotiations are incredibly complex and that the inevitable triggering of Article 50 by the end of March is unlikely to relieve the uncertainty. Banks that want clarity are not going to get it, and with time they will respond accordingly. Deutsche Bank’s chart on the UK’s negotiating position regarding financial services and Brexit",

Learn more... \nFri, Nov 18, 2016, 21:51 GMT - UK Markets closed Goldman Sachs has an idea for how to make money this holiday season By Alex Rosenberg | CNBC – 1 hour 10 minutes ago 28.69 -0.18 Looking for a fun Christmas gift? Perhaps you should consider stuffing some stockings with options on retail stocks. \nIn a note released this week, Goldman Sachs' options research team opined that \"there are significant catalysts for many retail stocks — including high uncertainty around Holiday selling season, preannouncement season for the sector and the ICR XChange Industry conference in January.\" \nYet despite this, \"the options market is pricing in a decline in volatility for many stocks into January,\" the team led by Katherine Fogertey and John Marshall wrote. \nIn other words, options appear to be too cheap. Which, of course, would be a reason to buy them. \nRather than simply buying calls to express a bullish thesis, or puts to express a bearish one, the Goldman team suggests doing both by buying straddles. This is a structure that entails buying both a put and a call with striking prices in line with the stock's current price. If a stocks moves more than the options market is expecting, a long straddle will turn a profit. \nSpecifically, Fogertey and Marshall suggest buying January-expiring straddles on shares of eBay , Under Armour , Nike and Kroger . \nYet Dennis Davitt, a longtime options trader now with Harvest Volatility Management, says that there's a reason the options market is pointing to reduced volatility for retail stocks. Many have seen big spikes in volatility recently. For instance, Under Armour tanked in late October following its earnings report, and Ebay did the same. \nMore generally, the prices of options have dropped across the board lately, now that the much-anticipated presidential election has fallen in into the rearview mirror. \n\"Options are beneficial to buy before periods of volatility when people are not looking at high historical yields,\" Davitt said Thursday on CNBC's \" Trading Nation .\" \n\"So it's kind of like, the hurricane has just passed, and now you want to buy insurance on it,\" he added. \"The options were priced for a volatile time, and now they're fairly priced.\" Maltesers shrink by 15% as prices rise, declares Mars Sky News - 2 hours 1 minute ago Mars has blamed rising costs for its decision to shrink the size of Maltesers packets.

      "text": "Goldman Sachs ( GS ) is forecasting euro parity against the greenback next year in its top ideas for 2017, with dollar strength relative to the euro and sterling taking the top spot as its number one trade.\nOthers include bullish calls targeting emerging markets and inflation-protected fixed income. For the full list, see below;\nTop Trade #1:\nDivergence between economic fortunes on either side of the Atlantic ocean are likely to mean further gains for the U.S dollar relative to the euro and the pound.\nGoldman sees the euro at parity against the dollar by the end of the fourth-quarter 2017. This is while sterling is set to trade between the bank's forecast of 1.2000 at the start of the year and 1.1400 by the end of the final quarter.\nIn addition to trading gains, investors could earn an interest rate carry of 1.3%, according to the presentation.\nTop Trade #2\nCapital outflows stemming from fears of a trade-fight with Donald Trump added to an already strong U.S. dollar, leave Goldman analysts anticipating a further decline of the Chinese currency relative to the dollar.\nThey forecast that the dollar-renminbi pair will rise from 6.87 at the end of 2016 to 7.30 by the close of 2017. However, Goldman's preferred means of trading the pair is via the 12-month non-deliverable-forward.\nTop Trade #3\nDollar strength remains a base ingredient of the Goldman Sachs menu for the year ahead but higher interest rates and a bullish outlook for emerging market economies has left analysts eyeing an EM carry-trade.",
