      "text": "IBM Named a Leader in Application Programming Interface (API) Management Solutions IBM cited for supporting combined strategies for API management, PaaS, and integration November 30, 2016 12:30 PM EST Blog This \nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . \nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. \nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\" \n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. \nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets. \nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018). \nAbout IBM Cloud \nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n1.

This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios.\nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence.\nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\"\n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\"\nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud.\nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.\nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets.\nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018).\nAbout IBM Cloud\nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\n1.

      "text": "IBM continues to trade at a discount valuation. \nHowever, investors are putting most of their eggs in the AI basket. \nCompanies such as Microsoft and Amazon have been more successful at commercializing cloud computing. \nNevertheless, IBM could still see significant upside if AI initiatives prove successful. I'll hold my own feet to the fire - my last article was overly optimistic on IBM (NYSE: IBM ). IBM is a company that has managed to reduce its dependency on hardware sales and ramp up its AI and cloud offerings - something which I had commended the company for previously. However, my prior analysis had presented the company as building a highly sophisticated cloud infrastructure that would put the company at a significant advantage to its peers. In reality, IBM may be ramping up its cloud offerings, but its big bet remains with Watson. While IBM has managed to make advances in the area of cloud, the company has not been able to achieve the success enjoyed by competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN ) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ). The server capacity of AWS far exceeds that of its rivals including IBM, while Microsoft Azure has been much more successful commercially due to Microsoft's subscription model allowing for more attractive price offerings and integration with other Microsoft products. In this light, IBM may be advancing its cloud capabilities, but don't expect that it can compete with the likes of Amazon or Microsoft. There is a reason IBM is relatively cheap on a valuation basis - the company's future is far more uncertain. While cloud computing has become an established industry, the demand for AI remains somewhat hazy from a commercial standpoint. With that being said, the company could be set to see quite significant demand for this technology. I had already mentioned that IBM is working with Medtronic (NYSE: MDT ) on the Watson Health cognitive computing technology in an effort to revolutionize diabetes treatment - a technology which would likely see very significant demand if successful. Moreover, one of the first big tests of eventual success in cognitive computing is the company's launch of the Watson IoT consulting services - which allows companies to harness cognitive computing in data analysis and innovation initiatives. According to Forrester, 60 percent of key decision-makers at global companies intend to use IoT-enabled applications over the next two years, and growing uptake of the same will likely be indicative of the eventual success of AI from a commercial standpoint. Ultimately, IBM can be argued to have a significant margin of safety given the cheap valuation. Of course, IBM as an investment is more uncertain and an investor is putting most of their eggs in the AI basket. This stock is somewhat riskier than I thought, but could still be a success if AI demand continues to grow. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT.

      "text": "International Business Machines Corp ( IBM - Free Report ) recently announced that its cloud platform, has been chosen by American Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL - Free Report ) to enhance its enterprise scalability, flexibility and reliability.\nThe move will not only enable American Airlines to switch some of its enterprise applications to the cloud but also allow it to leverage IBM Cloud’s global footprint that consists of more than 50 data centers across the world. Additionally, the airlines company will be able to take advantage of IBM Bluemix’s application development capabilities. To top it all, American Airlines will have access to IBM’s cognitive technologies that enable it to offer enhanced customer experience.\nINTL BUS MACH Price \nINTL BUS MACH Price | INTL BUS MACH Quote \nWhat this Means for IBM? \nIn third-quarter 2016, IBM’s total software revenue increased 3% year over year to $5.7 billion. Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 4.5% year over year to $4.24 billion. Software solutions registered growth of 8%, driven primarily by analytics (Watson platform, Big Data, Information Integration). Cloud was up an impressive 74%.\nWith CEO Ginni Rometty’s “strategic imperatives” in place, cloud remains a key focus area for IBM’s revenue growth. Moreover, as per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud services is estimated to reach $195 billion by 2020 that is currently growing at a CAGR of 20.4%.\nThese partnerships augur well for the company in the long run given the huge scope for cloud.\nHowever, intensifying competition in the cloud space with the presence of major players such as Amazon.com, Inc.’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) AWS and Microsoft’s Azure remain a concern for IBM going ahead.\nStock Performance Overview \nWe note that IBM’s stock price has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer Integrated Systems Industry over the last one year. While the stock generated a return of 18.83%, the sector generated a return of 27.89%.\nThe underperformance of the stock could be due to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the cloud is a major headwind.\nNevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth in the future.\nZacks Rank and Key Picks \nAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nA better ranked stock in the broader technology space is Diebold Inc ( DBD - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank  stocks here. \nNotably, the consensus estimate for Diebold’s current year has remained stable at $1.20 over the last seven days. \nZacks' Top Investment Ideas for Long-Term Profit \nHow would you like to see our best recommendations to help you find today’s most promising long-term stocks?

      "text": " In IBM's future, Watson will be your doctor Engadget 1 hr ago Daniel Cooper © Provided by Engadget IBM is working on a way to make its Watson supercomputer a far more effective medical tool for flesh-and-blood doctors. The company wants to use the platform to analyze medical imaging data to learn what a healthy set of insides looks like. It should then be able to identify when things have gone awry in scan images to direct doctors toward areas of concern. If this data is merged with each patient's medical records, it could mean faster and more effective treatment for serious conditions.\nThe company is desperate to turn a profit on all of the money it's crammed into selling Watson as a general-purpose supercomputing tool. The only problem is that is that IBM thinks every issue in the world can be solved with big data, but here it may actually work. After all, other companies are trying similar things -- including Zebra Medical , which does the same job with X-ray images. That firm is also letting patients upload their own CT scans and mammograms for a big data second opinion.\nOne of the systems that IBM is developing is a \"physician support tool,\" that seems to take much of the mental leg-work away from doctors. If a patient is diagnosed with a tumor, Watson will pull together data from various sources to develop a personalized health care plan. Another system will help emergency rooms detect a brain bleed by cross-checking scan data with their historical records to spot patterns. Although there's always a worry that Google -- via its DeepMind AI -- may have won the hearts and minds of clinicians across the world.\nPRNewsWire\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "IBM Named a Leader in Application Programming Interface (API) Management Solutions [November 30, 2016] Tweet \nARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . \nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. \nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\" \"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. \nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets. \nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018). \nAbout IBM Cloud \nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n1.

      "title": "Erich Bloch, Who Helped Develop IBM Mainframe, Dies at 91",
      "text": "Continue reading the main story Erich Bloch, who helped develop the IBM mainframe computer that, more than any other machine, propelled the world into the digital age, and who then shepherded the internet into broader use as director of the National Science Foundation , died on Friday in Washington. He was 91. The cause was complications of Alzheimer’s disease, his daughter, Rebecca Rosen, said. Mr. Bloch became a computer processing pioneer after arriving in the United States in 1948 as a Jewish refugee who had been orphaned by the Holocaust in Nazi Germany. He went to work for IBM four years later. In 1964, he made his signal achievement at the company when he transformed computing by introducing the System/360 , the foundation for the modern concept of an operating system that would host a variety of computer programs. The system enabled IBM to dominate the computer market for a quarter-century and provided the technology that now lets consumers bypass bank tellers with A.T.M.s and make travel reservations from home. After 32 years at IBM, Mr. Bloch was appointed director of the National Science Foundation by President Ronald Reagan. In his six-year term, from 1984 to 1990, he oversaw the transition of the foundation’s early generation digital network into a wider system that became today’s internet. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story He also fostered closer collaboration between industry and American universities and helped establish engineering research centers on their campuses as the foundation’s annual budget grew to $3 billion. Mr. Bloch was the foundation’s first director without a doctorate and the first from the business world rather than academia. To the dismay of some critics, his agenda combined basic research, which they championed, with product innovation and made the nation’s economic competitiveness a priority. The shift from pure to practical research represented “the first serious advance in science policy since 1950,” Michael M. Crow, a specialist on science policy and now the president of Arizona State University, wrote in 1994. . On Mr. Bloch’s 90th birthday, Donald V. Budinger, the chairman of the Science Foundation Arizona, said of him: “He stands for mustering the will to make bold investments, to stay relentless in the effort to improve the human condition. Think about that. That’s the primary purpose of research.” Mr. Bloch joined IBM right after graduating from the State University of New York, Buffalo, in 1952 with a degree in electrical engineering, hired to work in the company’s laboratory in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. As an undergraduate, he worked in a chemical plant to help pay for his education. “When I started at IBM, I was looked at as a screwball: ‘Yeah, he wants to play around with computers,’ ” Mr. Bloch said last year in an interview with AtBuffalo, the university’s alumni magazine. In the 1950s, he developed the first ferrite-core memory storage units to be used in computers commercially and worked on the IBM 7030, known as Stretch, the first transistorized supercomputer. “Asked what job each of us had, my answer was very simple and very direct,” Mr. Bloch said in 2002. “Getting that sucker working.”",

      "text": "Contact(s) information \nARMONK, N.Y. - 30 Nov 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave ™ : API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . Forrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a “leader” for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. \nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. \nThe report notes that since Forrester’s last Wave evaluation on this space, “IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,” and “its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.” \n“Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,” said Marie Wieck, general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. “We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM’s commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.” \nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. \nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. \nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets. \nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM’s Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2.2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018). \nAbout IBM Cloud \nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing . \n1.

      "text": "Tweet Share ARMONK, N.Y., Nov. 30, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 . IBM Corporation logo More Forrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios. The 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence. The report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\" \"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck, general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\" Increasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud. Additionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance. In addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets. IBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2.2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018).

      "text": "Enabling Hybrid Cloud Storage for IBM Spectrum Scale Using Transparent Cloud Tiering An IBM Redpaper publication Permanent link Abstract \nThis IBM® Redbooks® publication provides information to help you with the sizing, configuration, and monitoring of hybrid cloud solutions using the transparent cloud tiering (TCT) functionality of IBM Spectrum™ Scale. IBM Spectrum Scale™ is a scalable data, file, and object management solution that provides a global namespace for large data sets and several enterprise features. \nThe Spectrum Scale feature called transparent cloud tiering allows cloud object storage providers such as IBM Cloud Object Storage (previously known as Cleversafe), IBM SoftLayer®, and Amazon S3 to be used as a storage tier for IBM Spectrum Scale. Transparent cloud tiering can help cut storage capital and operating costs by moving data that does not require local performance to an on or off premise cloud object storage provider. \nTransparent cloud tiering reduces the complexity of cloud object storage by making data transfers transparent to the user or application. This capability can help you adapt to a hybrid cloud deployment model where active data remains directly accessible to your applications and inactive data is placed in the correct cloud (private or public) automatically through Spectrum Scale policies. \nThis publication is intended for IT architects, IT administrators, storage administrators, and those wanting to learn more about sizing, configuration, and monitoring of hybrid cloud solutions using Spectrum Scale and transparent cloud tiering.

      "text": "Permanent link Abstract \nFor more than 50 years, IBM® mainframes have supported an extraordinary portion of the world’s computing work, providing centralized corporate databases and mission-critical enterprise-wide applications. IBM z™ Systems, the latest generation of the IBM distinguished family of mainframe systems, has come a long way from its IBM System/360 heritage. Likewise, its IBM z/OS® operating system is far superior to its predecessors in providing, among many other capabilities, world-class and state-of-the-art support for the TCP/IP internet protocol suite. \nTCP/IP is a large and evolving collection of communication protocols that is managed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), an open, volunteer organization. Because of its openness, the TCP/IP protocol suite has become the foundation for the set of technologies that form the basis of the internet. The convergence of IBM mainframe capabilities with internet technology, connectivity, and standards (particularly TCP/IP) is dramatically changing the face of information technology and driving requirements for even more secure, scalable, and highly available mainframe TCP/IP implementations. \nThe IBM z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP Implementation series provides understandable, step-by-step guidance for enabling the most commonly used and important functions of z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP. \nThis IBM Redbooks® publication is for people who install and support z/OS Communications Server. It introduces z/OS Communications Server TCP/IP, describes the system resolver, and shows the implementation of global and local settings for single and multi-stack environments. It presents implementation scenarios for TCP/IP base functions, connectivity, routing, and subplexing. Table of contents \nChapter 1. Introduction to IBM Communications Server for z/OS IPChapter 2.

      "text": " IBM Corporation\nIBM cited for supporting combined strategies for API management, PaaS, and integration\nARMONK, N.Y. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) announced today that Forrester Research named IBM a leader in its recent report, The Forrester Wave™: API Management Solutions, Q4 2016 .\nForrester analyzed and scored numerous API management solutions and identified IBM as a \"leader\" for offering broad and deep functionality. This included creating business agility, adapting to constant change and responding to new and changing competition across a wide range of unpredictable scenarios.\nThe 27-criteria evaluation used in the report is designed to help application development and delivery (AD&D) professionals select the right API management platform for their needs. API management platforms were evaluated on current offerings, strategy and market presence.\nThe report notes that since Forrester's last Wave evaluation on this space, \"IBM has rebuilt its API management solution around its StrongLoop acquisition to create a unified solution for API management and APIs built using Node.js,\" and \"its new microgateway provides a developer-focused extension to API management.\"\n\"Companies are increasingly using APIs to connect new and existing IT services and integrate vast amounts of data as part of their digital transformation strategy and shift to the cloud,\" said Marie Wieck , general manager, IBM Hybrid Cloud. \"We believe this recognition by Forrester underscores IBM's commitment to offer clients innovative hybrid integration solutions for cloud and on-premises deployments to meet their business needs.\"\nIncreasingly, new cloud services depend on integrating data and applications. To allow for this strategic transformation to hybrid cloud environments, IBM offers an easy-to-consume cloud service, IBM API Connect , that developers can use to connect applications, data and microservices. It is designed to make it easier to find, call and connect over the cloud.\nAdditionally, IBM API Connect helps enable the automated creation of APIs, simplified discovery of systems of records, self-service access for internal and third party developers and built-in security and governance.\nIn addition to a new integration pattern that is further accelerated by the shift to Cloud, APIs may help make it easier to spur on digital transformation, IoT, Mobile and capturing company value and differentiation from existing IT assets.\nIBM helps meet the business needs of its customers by providing a unified solution for API management, that can either be fully vendor-managed, hybrid-vendor managed, or fully customer managed. API Connect is designed to provide value-add functions for platform as a service-based API implementation hosting through IBM Bluemix. Additionally, API Connect forms the basis for IBM's Connect to Cloud family of offerings that enables key IBM software products to expose existing assets to participate in the $2 .2T API economy (source – IBM estimates for 2018).\nAbout IBM Cloud\nFor more information on IBM Cloud visit: www.ibm.com/cloud-computing .\n1.

      "title": "IBM's Cloud Platform Selected by American Airlines Group - November 30, 2016",
      "text": "International Business Machines Corp ( IBM - Free Report ) recently announced that its cloud platform, has been chosen by American Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL - Free Report ) to enhance its enterprise scalability, flexibility and reliability.\nThe move will not only enable American Airlines to switch some of its enterprise applications to the cloud but also allow it to leverage IBM Cloud’s global footprint that consists of more than 50 data centers across the world. Additionally, the airlines company will be able to take advantage of IBM Bluemix’s application development capabilities. To top it all, American Airlines will have access to IBM’s cognitive technologies that enable it to offer enhanced customer experience.\nINTL BUS MACH Price\nINTL BUS MACH Price | INTL BUS MACH Quote:\nWhat this Means for IBM?\nIn third-quarter 2016, IBM’s total software revenue increased 3% year over year to $5.7 billion. Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 4.5% year over year to $4.24 billion. Software solutions registered growth of 8%, driven primarily by analytics (Watson platform, Big Data, Information Integration). Cloud was up an impressive 74%.\nWith CEO Ginni Rometty’s “strategic imperatives” in place, cloud remains a key focus area for IBM’s revenue growth. Moreover, as per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud services is estimated to reach $195 billion by 2020 that is currently growing at a CAGR of 20.4%.\nThese partnerships augur well for the company in the long run given the huge scope for cloud.\nHowever, intensifying competition in the cloud space with the presence of major players such as Amazon.com, Inc.’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) AWS and Microsoft’s Azure remain a concern for IBM going ahead.\nStock Performance Overview\nWe note that IBM’s stock price has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer Integrated Systems Industry over the last one year. While the stock generated a return of 18.83%, the sector generated a return of 27.89%.\nThe underperformance of the stock could be due to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the cloud is a major headwind.\nNevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth in the future.\nZacks Rank and Key Picks\nAt present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\nA better ranked stock in the broader technology space is Diebold Inc ( DBD - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).

      "text": "IBM's Cloud Platform Selected by American Airlines Group by Zacks Equity Research Published on November 30, 2016 Trades from $ 3 International Business Machines Corp ( IBM - Free Report ) recently announced that its cloud platform, has been chosen by American Airlines Group Inc. ( AAL - Free Report ) to enhance its enterprise scalability, flexibility and reliability. The move will not only enable American Airlines to switch some of its enterprise applications to the cloud but also allow it to leverage IBM Cloud’s global footprint that consists of more than 50 data centers across the world. Additionally, the airlines company will be able to take advantage of IBM Bluemix’s application development capabilities. To top it all, American Airlines will have access to IBM’s cognitive technologies that enable it to offer enhanced customer experience. \nINTL BUS MACH Price \nINTL BUS MACH Price | INTL BUS MACH Quote What this Means for IBM? In third-quarter 2016, IBM’s total software revenue increased 3% year over year to $5.7 billion. Cognitive Solutions (solutions software and transaction processing software) revenues grew 4.5% year over year to $4.24 billion. Software solutions registered growth of 8%, driven primarily by analytics (Watson platform, Big Data, Information Integration). Cloud was up an impressive 74%. With CEO Ginni Rometty’s “strategic imperatives” in place, cloud remains a key focus area for IBM’s revenue growth. Moreover, as per an IDC report, worldwide spending on public cloud services is estimated to reach $195 billion by 2020 that is currently growing at a CAGR of 20.4%. These partnerships augur well for the company in the long run given the huge scope for cloud. However, intensifying competition in the cloud space with the presence of major players such as Amazon.com, Inc.’s ( AMZN - Free Report ) AWS and Microsoft’s Azure remain a concern for IBM going ahead. Stock Performance Overview We note that IBM’s stock price has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer Integrated Systems Industry over the last one year. While the stock generated a return of 18.83%, the sector generated a return of 27.89%. The underperformance of the stock could be due to the ongoing and heavily time-consuming business model transition to cloud. Further, sluggish IT spending particularly on on-premise and data center hardware and foreign exchange volatility remain concerns. Moreover, intensifying competition in the cloud is a major headwind. Nevertheless, IBM's strategic growth initiatives, including its Big Data & business analytics, cloud computing, mobile and social business are expected to drive growth in the future. Zacks Rank and Key Picks At present, IBM carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). A better ranked stock in the broader technology space is Diebold Inc ( DBD - Free Report ) , sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Notably, the consensus estimate for Diebold’s current year has remained stable at $1.20 over the last seven days.

      "text": " IBM\nFirst IBM MobileFirst for iOS applications taken into use in Finnair Technical Operations\nHELSINKI and ARMONK, N.Y. , Nov. 30, Finnair and IBM (NYSE: IBM ) today announced a first-of-its-kind agreement to utilize iOS enterprise apps from IBM to support the airline's overall digital transformation.\nFinnair is focused on Asia - Europe traffic, carrying over 10 million customers annually and connecting 70 European destinations with 17 Asian mega-cities and three North-American cities via its Helsinki hub. In preparation for growth, Finnair has recruited more than 500 employees, rolled out new aircraft and launched new routes this year. Now, Finnair seeks to improve its processes and enhance the customer experience through digital transformation.\n\"Our collaboration with Apple and IBM is an important building block in our digital transformation,\" says Katri Harra-Salonen , Chief Digital Officer, Finnair. \"We want to link our employees with the insights they need to make better decisions. This collaboration enables a user focused, high quality, yet cost effective way of developing digital solutions, helping us to improve the way we operate as an airline.\"\nFirst applications from the collaboration will be deployed in Finnair Technical Operations in aircraft line maintenance in the beginning of 2017.\n\"We see a wealth of opportunities for improving productivity as well as adding value to the work flow of our employees, by improving real-time visibility and transparency across the entire maintenance process,\" says Jari Huhtinen, Head of Finnair Technical Operations. \"Our mechanics team participated in the application creation work with Apple and IBM to ensure the best possible design, user experience and fit into our organizational processes.\"\nFinnair is the first organization to take advantage of IBM's new app design and development model for clients that plan to adopt multiple iOS apps, called Mobile at Scale for iOS. This integrated approach, unique to IBM MobileFirst for iOS , increases the speed, efficiency and quality of how iOS apps are designed, developed, deployed, enhanced and maintained over their lifecycle.\nThe airline has a team in the IBM MobileFirst for iOS Garage dedicated to rapidly executing Finnair projects. The MobileFirst for iOS Garage operates as a global hub for the development of iOS, enabling Finnair to tap into the world's largest concentration of Swift developers, design, integration and iOS device expertise along with consulting services. The Garage team can deliver initial apps in weeks that are tailored to meet Finnair's enterprise needs and the user requirements of its employees This integrated approach brings consistency to the project, saving 25 percent of development effort, cost and time.\nThe apps will be managed and hosted on IBM Cloud allowing Finnair to implement multiple apps at speed and at scale, transforming everyday tasks for employees across the organization. The apps combine simplicity with the power of analytics to generate insight for more informed decision-making and better management.\n\"Finnair is innovating and setting an example -- not just for its industry, but for all enterprises. Rather than using mobile in silos, the airline is looking to IBM's industry expertise and solutions to digitize the entire airline,\" said Raimon Christiani , global industry leader IBM Travel & Transportation. \"Finnair has access to IBM's full portfolio of MobileFirst for iOS apps and if there's something else it needs to empower employees and provide Finnair passengers a more seamless travel experience, we can build it.\"\nThe first apps to be rolled out within the agreement are:\nInspect & Turn provides aircraft mechanics with digital task cards and documentation with analytics-driven recommendations to complete work assignments to ensure the safe upkeep of aircraft and achievement of on-time arrival and departure targets. Assign Tech provides aircraft mechanic supervisors a clear overview of ?ight schedules, maintenance process and mechanic availability. Using advanced analytics, the app recommends optimal shift assignments and incorporates the skills and certi?cations of each mechanic. Push noti?cations also alert supervisors to ?ight delays process issues, so they can easily make changes on the ?y. About Finnair\nFinnair flies between Asia , Europe and North America with an emphasis on fast connections via Helsinki , carrying more than ten million passengers annually and connecting 17 cities in Asia with more than 70 destinations in Europe . The only Nordic carrier with a 4-star Skytrax ranking, Finnair has also won the World Airline Award for Best Airline Northern Europe for the past seven years running.

      "text": "Microsoft, Intel, IBM Push Back on China Cybersecurity Rules  55:  \nBEIJING—Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing. \nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers. \nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors—and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections. \nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\" \nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7. \nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017. \nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S.National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas. \nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts. \nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities. \nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\" \nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\" \nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification. \nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft. \nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications. \n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM. \nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\" \nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have. \nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law. \n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\" \nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced—but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said. \nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\" \nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies. \n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security'sNetwork Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\" \nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article. \nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com  160555ET   Technology",

Subscribers can download a limited selection of its content for viewing even without an internet connection. As Devindra Hardawar points out , the move was inevitable after Amazon Prime expanded caching support last year, but is it enough to keep you happy? \nBack to the present A first look at Nike's self-lacing sneakers \nPower laces are real. The HyperAdapt 1.0 hits the streets today, but Edgar Alvarez got an early look. Nike says one charge is enough to keep that E.A.R.L. motor grinding away for a couple of weeks, but your biggest problem could be getting your hands on a pair of the $720 sneakers. \nWe only have ourselves to blame The 2017 patch for \"League of Legends\" is heavily influenced by players \nRiot Games' Greg Street explains the impetus behind upcoming changes for the popular MOBA, saying \"we want to create a good environment for all players.\" That means keepingeSports pros and average joes happy using the same ruleset, across a base of 103 million players. \"League of Legends\" patch 6.24 goes live December 7th with a new practice mode,changes to the jungle, post-game replays and more. \nIt's early DirecTV Now hands-on \nAT&T's new internet TV service is... a lot like the other internet TV offerings we've seen. Testing DirecTV Now streaming via Apple TV revealed a better UI than the one Sling TV offers, but right now, it can't match the DVR feature of PlayStation Vue. \nPhabulous Motorola's president says a Tango Moto mod is \"likely\" \nWe didn't immediately fall in love with Lenovo's Project Tango-packing Phab 2 Pro , but what if you could buy its reality-measuring sensors as an add-on? At a Chicago event, Motorola Mobility president Aymar de Lencquesaing said that the Lenovo subsidiary is \"likely to have a Tango module\" for the Moto Z line of smartphones, so stay tuned. \nIf they have a warrant, it doesn't matter where you are Senate fails to stop FBI's expanded hacking authority \nnate fails to stop FBI's expanded hacking authorityA Senate effort to stop an expansion of the FBI's authority to hack computers has failed. A rule change going into effect today means judges can issue warrants that let it hack computers regardless of jurisdiction. Senators like Ron Wyden are concerned about possible unintended consequences, and he called it \"one of the biggest mistakes in surveillance policy in years.\" \nLong-term planning The EPA will push to lock in fuel efficiency goals before the Trump administration arrives \nIn 2012, the EPA set a goal for automakers to double fuel efficiency by 2025. Today, it proposed leaving those rules in place without any updates, citing technical analysis that shows automakers will be able to meet the deadline. The reason for that move? Locking standards in could make it tougher for the incoming administration to reverse or modify the guidelines. But wait, there's more...",

      "text": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery Collaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights  00   ARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1,   IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. Immunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. Watson Health and Pfizer announce a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology. Shahram Ebadollahi, VP Innovations and Chief Scientific Officer at Watson Health, and Bob Abraham, Senior VP and Head of Oncology R&D at Pfizer, discuss the importance of this collaboration and the promise of Watson for Drug Discovery's cognitive capabilities to help Pfizer bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more... Using machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies, Watson for Drug Discovery can help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications by looking across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. Cancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" Laurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" The newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" About IBM Watson Health Watson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": " 00 AM EST IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery \nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

IBM’s Deborah DiSanzo made the announcement at the 2016 Forbes Healthcare Summit. \nImmunotherapy is an approach that uses the immune system to fight diseases, unlike chemotherapy, which kills cancer cells. Immunotherapy works on cells in the immune system to combat cancer.

Watson will also be able to combine such a massive database with Pfizer’s own proprietary research information. ‘s president of worldwide research and development, said in an interview. “I read hundreds of papers over a few months, but I cannot read millions like Watson can.” \nWithout the cognitive computing and artificial intelligence IBM Watson brings to the table, Dolsten compared drug discovery and developing hypotheses as trying to find three trees that share similarities in a large forest. Inside Obamacare: The Fix For America’s Ailing Health Care System explores the ways the Affordable Care Act will impact your health care. \n“You could spend a lifetime looking for the trees that share the similarities,” Dolsten said. “The cognitive computing looks for patterns.” \nPfizer decided to collaborate with Watson after a potential treatment target emerged during a pilot program in the last year and a half, Dolsten said. \nPfizer was working on two products “outside of cancer” and fed information about that research into Watson, which later suggested a “very strong combination outcome” as a possible cancer treatment. Meanwhile, Pfizer’s own drug research team suggested a similar combination, giving the drug maker’s research team confidence it was headed in the right direction. “We’re now trying to validate it in animals,” Dolsten said in an interview. He wouldn’t disclose the product or when it may reach human trials. \nCancer is one of the world’s leading causes of death and it’s a rapidly changing field requiring a single researcher to look at several hundred pieces of medical research in a given year. Researchers and scientists “need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,” said Lauren O’Donnell, IBM Watson Health’s vice president of life sciences. \nThe drug discovery collaboration is the latest of IBM’s expansion into healthcare. IBM Watson already has other partnerships with companies like CVS to bring better care coordination and more personalize care to pharmacy customers. IBM Watson also has collaborations with , and to link health care companies to a new cloud-based architecture. ",

      "text": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery - Collaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights \nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA discovering new medicines is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "BEIJING—Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors—and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced—but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\n 05:55 ET (10:55 ",

      "text": "By Eva Dou\nBEIJING--Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors--and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced--but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally. When China passed the cybersecurity law last month, a spokesman for the internet regulator said foreigners who thought the law would favor domestic firms had a \"misunderstanding, a biased view.\"\nBut in Technical Committee 260's discussions, certain government officials argued for the standards to be drafted to favor domestic companies.\n\"The big trend is called shifting to domestic production,\" wrote Guo Qiquan, chief engineer at the China Ministry of Public Security's Network Security Bureau, in a suggestion that the committee marked \"approved.\" \"But it can't be written that way, so one calls it independent and controllable.\"\nYang Jie, Rachael King and Don Clark contributed to this article.\nWrite to Eva Dou at eva.dou@wsj.com\n 05:33 ET (10:33 ",

      "text": "In IBM's future, Watson will be your doctor Engadget 3 hrs ago Daniel Cooper © Provided by Engadget IBM is working on a way to make its Watson supercomputer a far more effective medical tool for flesh-and-blood doctors. The company wants to use the platform to analyze medical imaging data to learn what a healthy set of insides looks like. It should then be able to identify when things have gone awry in scan images to direct doctors toward areas of concern. If this data is merged with each patient's medical records, it could mean faster and more effective treatment for serious conditions.\nThe company is desperate to turn a profit on all of the money it's crammed into selling Watson as a general-purpose supercomputing tool. The only problem is that is that IBM thinks every issue in the world can be solved with big data, but here it may actually work. After all, other companies are trying similar things -- including Zebra Medical , which does the same job with X-ray images. That firm is also letting patients upload their own CT scans and mammograms for a big data second opinion.\nOne of the systems that IBM is developing is a \"physician support tool,\" that seems to take much of the mental leg-work away from doctors. If a patient is diagnosed with a tumor, Watson will pull together data from various sources to develop a personalized health care plan. Another system will help emergency rooms detect a brain bleed by cross-checking scan data with their historical records to spot patterns. Although there's always a worry that Google -- via its DeepMind AI -- may have won the hearts and minds of clinicians across the world.\nPRNewsWire\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Related resources \nARMONK, New York and NEW YORK - 01 Dec 2016: IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer’s research in immuno-oncology , an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body’s immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson’s machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nUsing machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies, Watson for Drug Discovery can help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications by looking across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. (Credit: IBM) \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient’s immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer’s proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated. \n“Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,” said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. “With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.” \nLaurie Olson, Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, “At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients .” \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization’s private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations. \n“We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,” said Lauren O’Donnell, Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. “IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.” \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015, the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "title": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery",
      "text": " IBM\nCollaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights\nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology.\nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.\n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\"\nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\"\nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.\n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\"\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "Box Gets Another IBM Boost, Stock Nears Buy Point After Solid Beat Box has leveraged partnerships with IBM and others to accelerate growth. (BOX) Reprints \nCloud data storage firm Box ( BOX ) continues to leverage partnerships, led by its pact with IBM ( IBM ), to grow its business and score earnings beats. \nBox stock was up nearly 3% in early trading in the stock market today , after the company late Wednesday posted a beat for its fiscal Q3 ended Oct. 31, and guided above Wall Street models for the current quarter. Trading above 15.50, shares were near a possible 16.69 buy point . Box stock hit a 16-month high of 16.59 on Oct. 4. \nThe company has taken what one analyst has called a \"Switzerland\" approach in enabling its service to work on many platforms, including the Office 365 platform of sometimes-rival Microsoft ( MSFT ), as well as IBM and internet giants Facebook ( FB ) and Alphabet 's ( GOOGL ) Google. Besides data storage, Box offers file-sharing and collaboration services. \n\"Billings and revenues were driven by new products, built on top of the company's platform, leading not only to customer expansions but also new customer wins with the Governance product,\" Rosenblatt Securities analyst Marshall Senk wrote in a research note Thursday. \"IBM continues to be a significant contributor delivering eight of the 38 deals greater than $100,000.\" IBD'S TAKE: Facebook and Google are two of the so-called FANG internet giants, along with Amazon and Netflix. All have been great stocks at times, but not at other times. Post-Trump victory, the FANGs have been on the downside . \nSenk says IBM also drove 20% of Box's top 20 deals in the July quarter. \nSenk maintained a buy rating and 25 price target on Box stock, while Pacific Crest Securities maintained its overweight rating and 21 price target. \n\"Box's competitive moat continues to widen as the company commands relevance with market-leading innovation and functionality,\" Pacific Crest analysts Rob Owens and Ben McFadden wrote in their research report. \"As milestones are achieved and lend confidence to the company's $1 billion target for fiscal 2021, we believe BOX's multiple will continue to rerate higher as investors catch on to the underlying differentiation and compelling model characteristics of the story.\" \nBox posted revenue of $303 million for its fiscal 2016 ended Jan. 31, so it will need the heft of IBM and other big partners to hit its targets. \n\"While we are not forecasting significant revenue from either the Facebook or Google partnerships, we do believe these deals carry weight with large customers who see the continued expansion of the ecosystem as an endorsement of not only the company's platform strategy but also the strength of the technology,\" Senk wrote. \nRELATED:",

By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST Global Business Services segment \nPreviously in this series, we discussed the 3Q16 performance of IBM’s ( IBM ) Cognitive Solutions and Technology Services and Cloud Platforms segments. Let’s see how IBM’s Global Business Services (or GBS) segment performed in 3Q16. \nThe GBS segment’s revenue fell 0.4% to $4.2 billion in 3Q16. On a constant currency basis, this fall was 1.6%. IBM’s GBS segment encompasses the Consulting, Global Process Services, and Application Management businesses. \nIn 3Q16, the Application Management business, which contributed ~48% toward the GBS segment’s revenue, rose 2% to $2 billion. The remaining ~43% and ~10% were contributed by the Consulting and Global Process Services businesses, respectively. These businesses reported revenue falls of 5% and 1%, respectively. \nThe Strategic Imperatives business’s revenue in GBS rose 12% to $2.3 billion, while the Cloud business’s revenue rose 69% to $800 million on a constant currency basis. IBM continues to boost its Interactive Experience business \nIBM continues to boost its Interactive Experience (or iX) business, part of its GBS segment, via strategic acquisitions. Later in the series, we’ll discuss the company’s recent acquisition of Expert Personal Shopper to better equip its iX unit in the increasingly digitized world. \nApart from Expert Personal Shopper, IBM has acquired Ecx.io , Aperto , Resource/Ammirati , and Bluewolf Group so far in 2016 to broaden its iX capabilities. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"IBM\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"International Business Machines Corp.\"]}",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 7 OF 14 Why IBM, Its Peers, and Banks Are Moving toward Blockchain By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST Financial and technology players seek collaboration \nWe’ve discussed IBM’s ( IBM ) ongoing initiatives to increase its pace in blockchain technology. The company has collaborated with several industry leaders in both the technology and financial spaces to develop the open-source Hyperledger. \nIn simple terms, blockchain can be referred to as a simple ledger, which is operated by a set of algorithms that keep it not only secure but also up to date. Blockchain applications are also referred to as distributed ledger technology. Since they’re decentralized, they eliminate the need for a centralized database. \nBlockchain technology is the foundation of bitcoin, the world’s first decentralized digital currency, also known as cryptocurrency. Cryptocurrency is an encrypted digital currency that works independently of banks or regulatory authorities. \nIBM isn’t the only technology player with its eyes on blockchain technology as a new avenue for revenue growth. In April 2016, Microsoft ( MSFT ) partnered with R3CV to develop blockchain technology. \nHyperledger’s partnership with KYCK! and Microsoft’s partnership with R3CV reflects the increasing interest of financial and technology players in harnessing the benefits of blockchain technology. \nGoldman Sachs ( GS ) believes that blockchain could be used in voting systems, wire fees, firearm purchase background checks, vehicle registrations, and trade settlements. Recently, according to CNBC, JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) invested ~$9 billion in the technology space, with a significant focus on blockchain technology. Speed, security, among other uses are driving blockchain’s adoption \nIn a blockchain, each single block amounts to an electronic record that cannot be altered or meddled with once included in the chain. Also, each block possesses its own timestamp and a connection to an earlier block in the chain, providing all concerned parties with easy access to information through a secure network. \nFinancial institutions believe that blockchain technology can eliminate the inefficiencies currently present in financial markets. They also believe that it can provide enhanced liquidity, transparency, and security. Blockchain technology eliminates the need for an intermediary, mitigating the risk of human error with full automation. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"MSFT\",\"GS\",\"IBM\",\"JPM\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Microsoft Corporation\",\"Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.\",\"International Business Machines Corp.\",\"JPMorgan Chase & Co.\"]} X",

      "text": "Tech giant IBM ibm and flagship U.S. pharma Pfizer pfe this morning announced a wide-ranging new collaboration to help identify next-generation cancer treatments.\nPfizer will be harnessing the power of IBM’s Watson supercomputer to assist in drug discovery for cancer immunotherapies, which are medicines that use the body’s own immune system to help battle tumors.\nImmuno-oncology has become an increasingly popular field for biopharma companies. Firms like Merck mrk , Bristol-Myers Squibb bmy , Roche, and others have invested heavily in the space, including in a specific type of new cancer immunotherapy called “checkpoint inhibitors” that have been bringing in massive sales. Merck, BMS, and Roche have all had their flagship checkpoint inhibitors approved over the past two years, and Pfizer recently filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its own rival product.\nThese companies plan to build on these next-gen cancer medicines by discovering new molecules, developing new products, and testing out combinations of drugs to see which cancers they can treat most effectively. And that’s where Watson Health’s help will be critical. As IBM notes, the average researcher reads between 200 and 300 scientific articles per year. But the volume of cancer research data coming out on an annual basis dwarfs that, making it impossible for even scientists at a pharmaceutical titan like Pfizer to keep up with the mountains of new, potentially relevant information.\nWatson, with its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, will assist Pfizer researchers in identifying the most promising research, drug candidates, and therapy combinations.\nClick here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. \n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies like IBM Watson can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, in a statement. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.”\nIBM Watson is partnered with a bevy of major cancer institutes, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson, to assist in data analytics.",

      "text": "Home > Stock Picks > Hot Stocks > Why the Heck Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) Stock as Cheap as IBM? If we're going by earnings, AAPL stock is worth no more than shares of Big Blue ... and that's baffling By Dana Blankenhorn , InvestorPlace Contributor | Dec 1, 2016, 9:02 am EST Source: Yuanbin Du Via Flickr \nThe companies — at least from the standpoint of earnings — are nearly identical. \nNow, you’ll get a little bit less of IBM for your money. Big Blue trades at about $162 per each of its less than 1 billion shares. Meanwhile, AAPL stock trades at about $110 for each of its 5.3 billion shares. \nBut when you buy stock, you’re buying a call on earnings, both now and in the future. We are comparing oranges to oranges here. And these two companies, right now, are among the biggest bargains on the technology landscape. Why Is Apple Stock So Cheap? \nApple has been cheap for a long time, ever since CEO Tim Cook decided to share the company’s wealth with his investors. What those investors see today is a company with declining sales, declining margins and a dividend yielding just 2.1%. \nThey might see Apple’s $200 billion in cash and the 25% profit margins, but they certainly don’t value those things. They don’t value AAPL’s success in services, which have enabled it to pay for its huge capital expenditures of the last few years out of earnings. The 10 Best Under-the-Radar Stocks to Buy for 2017 \nWhile investors will pay 29 times earnings for Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ), 28 times earnings for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) and a whopping 46 times earnings for Facebook Inc (NASDAQ: FB ), they have decided that Apple’s best days are behind it. One analyst thinks Apple’s stock price is going to be cut in half because it’s too reliant on the iPhone. \nNever mind that Apple has plenty of cash to go after automating healthcare, creating virtual worlds and augmenting reality with new interfaces. Never mind that Apple could buy IBM, today, for cash , and still have enough left over to pick up Salesforce.com Inc. (NYSE: CRM ) if it chose to do so. \nThis bearishness is not new. Apple was very near its current price at the start of 2015. Over the last year, the shares are down 6%. \nIBM, on the other hand, is up almost 18% in 2016. And that’s the mystery. Why Is IBM stock So Dear? \nI’ve suggested breaking the company up , and IBM is vulnerable to the kind of slash-and-burn tactics Wall Street hedge fund managers love to deploy on failure. Sell the assets, dump the employees, throw the retirement obligations on the taxpayers and profit! \nIBM has long been in the practice of extracting its own capital and giving it back to shareholders. The dividend has doubled in the last five years even though sales are down 20%, and the debt-to-assets ratio has been climbing steadily.",

      "text": "A Closer Look at IBM’s Growth-Chasing Strategy PART 9 OF 14 Why IBM Acquired Expert Personal Shopper By Anne Shields | Nov 29, 2016 2:07 pm EST IBM targeted Expert Personal Shopper to boost its iX division \nEarlier in the series, we discussed IBM’s ( IBM ) GBS segment’s performance in 3Q16. In 2016, IBM has made several strategic acquisitions to boost its Interactive Experience (or iX) business, part of its GBS segment. \nTo give iX a further push, IBM announced its acquisition of Fluid’s Expert Personal Shopper (or XPS) division at the beginning of November 2016. Fluid provides digital customer experiences. \nXPS is “a dialogue-based product recommendation platform” that converses with people online to help them with their purchases, make recommendations, and facilitate the shopping process. This platform uses IBM’s Watson technology to customize and enhance the customer experience. XPS is delivered via subscription. It provides customized recommendations on a company’s website and can be integrated with social channels. \nIBM’s acquisition of XPS marks the company’s fifth acquisition aimed at broadening its iX capabilities in 2016 after Ecx.io , Aperto , Resource/Ammirati , and BlueWolf Group . With XPS, IBM aims to harness the e-commerce space \nIn 2014, IBM invested in Fluid’s XPS app. Both companies worked together with the aim of evolving the e-commerce experience beyond the traditional realms of price, convenience, and selection. With Watson’s cognitive technology, the companies added the prowess and tailored advice of an in-store sales representative. In the words of Kent Deverell, Fluid’s CEO, “Three years ago, Fluid, in collaboration with IBM Watson, developed the very first commercial example of conversational commerce.” \nXPS isn’t the first company IBM has invested in first and then bought it out. In early 2016, to enhance Watson’s dataset, IBM bought data and digital assets from The Weather Company for ~$2 billion. Prior to this acquisition, in March 2015, IBM had entered into a partnership with The Weather Company as part of its billion-dollar investment in the Internet of Things (or IoT) space. \nPaul Papas, the global leader of IBM iX, said, “We look to incorporate the Expert Personal Shopper platform into the customer engagement and commerce solutions that we create for our retail clients.” \nE-commerce is a rapidly growing market, dominated by Amazon ( AMZN ). To tap this growing market, in mid-2016, Salesforce ( CRM ) announced its acquisition of Demandware to gain entry into the lucrative e-commerce space. Though IBM’s Watson is gaining recognition, it still faces intense competition from Amazon and Salesforce.com.

      "text": "What Does the Future Hold for Apple? PART 9 OF 10 How Is IBM Helping Apple Sell More Devices? By Puneet Sikka | Nov 29, 2016 11:13 am EST IBM sees huge cost savings by deploying Apple’s devices \nApple ( AAPL ) and IBM’s ( IBM ) partnership continues to gain strength. These companies had forged a partnership in 2014 to have IBM analyze data collected from Apple devices. The partnership also aims to develop more than 100 mobile apps specifically for enterprises. IBM is also helping Apple directly by deploying Apple’s devices for its own employees. Apple mentioned that IBM has now deployed 90,000 Macs, 48,000 iPads, and 81,000 iPhones for its employees across the organization. \nBy deploying Apple’s devices in its organization, IBM is managing huge cost savings. According to Apple, “IBM reports that PCs have three times the cost to manage, drive twice the number of support calls and are 5 times more likely to require a follow-up appointment to resolve an issue than Macs. Thanks to much lower support cost and significantly higher residual value, the company is saving as much as $535 per computer when comparing the total cost of Mac ownership to a PC over a full-year lifecycle.” Apple has also partnered with Deloitte and Revel Systems \nIn addition to IBM, Apple has also entered a major partnership with Deloitte in order to generate more business from enterprises. During the fiscal 4Q16 earnings conference call, Apple mentioned that under this partnership, Apple has developed a new consulting service named “Enterprise Next” for the purpose of providing custom solutions to companies in more than 20 industries. Apple also partnered with Revel Systems to provide iPad-based POS (point-of-sale) solutions at 34,000 Shell (RDS.A) retail locations. This partnership also includes support for Apple Pay around the world.

      "title": "IBM & Mahindra to Develop Blockchain Supply Chain Finance Solutions in India",
      "text": "Weibo \nT echnology giant IBM has announced a partnership with Indian conglomerate and multinational Mahindra to develop blockchain solutions to revolutionize supply chain finance in the country. \nThe two companies aim to develop a cloud-based solution that is a notable departure from existing traditional banking protocols in India , to enable trade finance transactions from suppliers-to-manufacturers through a permissioned blockchain. \nMarket observers and researchers of blockchain applications in the financial industry frequently tout trade finance as a sector primed for blockchain disruption. If successful, a blockchain solution for small and mid-sized enterprises in India could have a telling impact in the way the innovation can streamline and fasten business transactions while reducing risks and errors. \nAnnounced today, the IBM-Mahindra blockchain solution will fundamentally enable all parties involved in a supply chain finance solution to act on a singular shared ledger. The supplier and manufacturers will update their individual parts of the transactional process to contribute to a rounded transaction in a process that will ensure increased efficiency and transparency. \nIBM elaborates on this with the example of invoice discounting, a common practice in India which is where a finance company issues a loan by taking note of a company’s unpaid settlements from its customers, as collateral. Traditionally, it has proven a cumbersome process where dues can be prolonged and go often unpaid, while errors are commonplace due to different parties maintaining separate and oftentimes inconsistent ledgers. Over a blockchain, however, suppliers will be able to access credit and capital from financiers when transactions and numbers are recorded in a shared ledger in real-time. \nThe immediate benefactors of the IBM-developed blockchain platform will be Mahindra Finance, the company’s financing arm for everyday Indians. \nAnish Shah, Mahindra Group president for strategy said in statements: \nThis proof of concept represents a significant step forward in blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business. \n\nThe executive also added that Mahindra is looking at blockchain solutions beyond the financial sector in the auto and agritech industries – the company is a major car and tractor manufacturer with exports around the world. \nIBM global business services’ managing partner Lula Mohanty added: \nBlockchain is poised to revolutionize business like the Internet did, and IBM is at the forefront of the revolution…The work with Mahindra has the potential to fundamentally transform the way businesses interact with one another and their customers and suppliers, and we’re confident that this engagement can be replicated not just in the finance industry but across other sectors as well. \nRampant Blockchain Development to Disrupt Traditional Trade Finance \nThe announcement comes in a year when a number of blockchain-based endeavors to develop solutions in the trade finance sector have come to the fore, around the world. Singaporean bank DBS and London-based Standard Chartered were working toward a trade finance blockchain platform as early as December 2015, while the Bank of America conducted its own pilot earlier this year. More recently, the bank partnered with Microsoft to press on with a distributed ledger trade finance solution. Blockchain tech could have a telling impact on global trade finance. \n\nIn India, major private sector bank ICICI also announced a successful trade finance pilot transaction over a blockchain between Mumbai and Dubai that saw shredded steel metal scrap imported into India from a UAE-based supplier. \nBeyond the pilots and proof-of-concepts, the world’s first global trade finance powered by blockchain technology saw the exports of cheese and butter worth nearly $100,000 from a supplier in Ireland to a food distributor in Seychelles. \nImages from Shutterstock.",

      "text": "IBM Aids Development of Blockchain Solution (IBM) By Jeff Hawkins | December 1, 2016 — 11:22 AM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) on Wednesday announced it’s collaborating with the Mahindra Group to develop a blockchain solution, according to a press release. \nBased in Armonk, New York, IBM, which has a market valuation of $154.25 billion, specializes in information technology services. The Mahindra Group is an international collection of companies headquartered in India. (See also: IBM Makes Largest Ever Deployment Of Macs .) \nThe supply chain finance solution is a cloud-based application that focuses on operational processes, security and transparency. It was created to reshape supplier-to-manufacturer deals via a permission-enabled distributed ledger and is one of the few available in India. The app allows everyone involved in the transaction to utilize a shared ledger, a release noted. \n“The Mahindra Group is pioneering the use of blockchain to disrupt its traditional businesses and drive future growth,” said Anish Shah, group president of strategy. “We are actively looking at other applications in financial services, auto, mobility and agritech. This proof of concept represents a significant step forward in making blockchain, still a new technology, a more compelling and efficient supply chain solution for Mahindra Finance’s small and mid-sized enterprises loans business.” \nIBM’s stocks ended Wednesday’s session trading at $162.53, a decrease of .80 percent. While the company’s stocks took a step back, it remained just $2.47 shy of establishing a new 52-week high.

      "text": "ARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --  IBM (NYSE:  IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool - tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology. \nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments. \nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.   \n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\" \nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA - discovering new medicines - is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\" \nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery  is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated.  Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.  \n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\" \nAbout IBM Watson Health \nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. How Pfizer and IBM Are Teaming Up to Develop Next-Gen Cancer Drugs \nTech giant IBM ibm and flagship U.S. pharma Pfizer pfe this morning announced a wide-ranging new collaboration to help identify next-generation cancer treatments. \nPfizer will be harnessing the power of IBM’s Watson supercomputer to assist in drug discovery for cancer immunotherapies, which are medicines that use the body’s own immune system to help battle tumors. \nImmuno-oncology has become an increasingly popular field for biopharma companies. Firms like Merck mrk , Bristol-Myers Squibb bmy , Roche, and others have invested heavily in the space, including in a specific type of new cancer immunotherapy called “checkpoint inhibitors” that have been bringing in massive sales. Merck, BMS, and Roche have all had their flagship checkpoint inhibitors approved over the past two years, and Pfizer recently filed for Food and Drug Administration (FDA) of its own rival product. \nThese companies plan to build on these next-gen cancer medicines by discovering new molecules, developing new products, and testing out combinations of drugs to see which cancers they can treat most effectively. And that’s where Watson Health’s help will be critical. As IBM notes, the average researcher reads between 200 and 300 scientific articles per year. But the volume of cancer research data coming out on an annual basis dwarfs that, making it impossible for even scientists at a pharmaceutical titan like Pfizer to keep up with the mountains of new, potentially relevant information. \nWatson, with its machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities, will assist Pfizer researchers in identifying the most promising research, drug candidates, and therapy combinations. \nClick here to subscribe to Brainstorm Health Daily, our brand new newsletter about health innovations. \n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies like IBM Watson can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, president of Pfizer Worldwide Research and Development, in a statement. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.” \nIBM Watson is partnered with a bevy of major cancer institutes, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson, to assist in data analytics.

      "text": "Posted by Chuck Coulson, Global Technology Partnerships\n\n\nIf your organization runs IBM software, we have news for you: Google Cloud Platform is now officially an IBM Eligible Public Cloud, meaning you can run a wide range of IBM software SKUs on Google Compute Engine with your existing licenses.\n\nUnder IBM's Bring Your Own Software License policy (BYOSL) , customers who have licensed, or wish to license, IBM software through either Passport Advantage or an authorized reseller, may now run that software on Compute Engine. This applies to the majority of IBM's vast catalog of software -- everything from middleware and DevOps products (Websphere, MQ Series, DataPower, Tivoli) to data and analytics offerings (DB2, Informix, Cloudant, Cognos, BigInsights).\n\n\nWhat comes next depends on you. Help us identify the IBM software that needs to be packaged, tuned, and optimized for Compute Engine. You can let us know what IBM software you plan to run on Google Cloud by taking this short survey . And feel free to reach out to me directly with any questions. ",

      "text": "IBM, Pfizer Announce Partnership (IBM, PFE) By Daniel Kobialka | December 1, 2016 — 3:42 PM EST \nInternational Business Machines Corp. ( IBM ) and Pfizer Inc. ( PFE ) have announced a partnership to accelerate immuno-oncology research. (See also: IBM Aids Development of Blockchain Solution .) \nThe companies today said PFE will use IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to speed up its immuno-oncology research. PFE will leverage Watson for Drug Discovery's cognitive reasoning technologies to \"support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology,\" according to IBM. \nMikael Dolsten, PFE's president of worldwide research and development, said Watson for Drug Discovery may help his company bring new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients faster than ever before. \"We believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,\" he said. \nLauren O'Donnell, vice president of life sciences for IBM Watson Health, stated her company is \"honored\" to work with PFE. Together, IBM and PFE may be able to deliver life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients globally, O'Donnell said. \"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge,\" she noted. What Does the Partnership Mean for Both Companies? \nIBM remains one of the world's leading technology companies, and PFE represents a globally recognized pharmaceutical business. The collaboration between IBM and PFE may prove to be mutually beneficial and empower both businesses to extend their global reach. \nFor IBM, the partnership enables the company to promote Watson for Drug Discovery, a cloud-based solution that is designed to help life sciences researches evaluate new drug targets and alternative drug indications. Watson for Drug Discovery allows life sciences researchers to examine disparate data sets, IBM said, and uncover hidden patterns through visualizations. \nDolsten pointed out PFE is dedicated to \"staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research.\" Subscribe to News To Use for the latest insights and analysis   Investopedia Insights - News to Use.",

      "text": "12-01-2016 Clarkson University's Snyder Panelist at IBM's World of Watson Conference \nClarkson University Department of Education Chair Catherine Snyder served on a panel at IBM’s World of Watson Conference in Las Vegas, earlier this semester. \nBrian Dempsey (MAT '08), Offering Manager for IBM Watson Education, approached Snyder -- given her worldwide expertise in higher education -- to share some initial thinking and get feedback on an innovative project for higher education. Snyder was very excited about the project and offered to continue in a ‘sound board’ role for this and other Watson Education projects going forward. \nAt the conference, the panel discussion introduced the notion of an IBM Watson software solution that can act as an \"intelligent tutor.\" The solution fits in between a professor and/or graduate teaching assistant and the student. \nThis intelligent tutor would work with the student on fundamentals of the curriculum, common misconceptions, and basic concepts. This can free up the professor and TA to tackle more complex ideas, react to the data analytics that Watson can gather while tutoring, and generally make the time spent human-to-human more effective and efficient. \nSnyder remarked that an intelligent tutor powered by Watson would possess three qualities that a human tutor does not: \n- It would be infinitely patient. It would never get exasperated! \n- It would not be biased. Watson will not judge a mistake; will not make assumptions about a student based on dress, appearance, academic skill, reaction time; etc. \n- It would have infinite time. Watson will never run out of time. It can spend as much or as little time with the student as needed. \nSnyder says that the data analytics could be incredible: \"If I was, for example, a professor in an introductory psychology class with 60 students, the intelligent tutor could tell me what the most common errors were my students were making, what misconceptions surfaced, etc. That could then allow me to adjust my class for the next day to address these very specific needs. I would no longer have to base my assumptions about student understanding on past classes taught, or anecdotal office hour conversations. I could also dispatch my graduate teaching assistants in more precise ways to meet the needs of the learners in the class.\" \n  \nPhoto caption: Clarkson University Department of Education Chair Catherine Snyder (right) served on a panel at IBM’s World of Watson Conference in Las Vegas, earlier this semester. \n[A photograph  //www.clarkson.edu/news/photos/csnyder-watson.jpg .] [News  ",

      "title": "IBM and Pfizer to Accelerate Immuno-oncology Research with Watson for Drug Discovery",
      "text": " IBM\nCollaboration combines IBM Watson's cognitive computing capabilities with Pfizer's scientific knowledge to help scientists generate meaningful insights\nARMONK, N.Y. and NEW YORK IBM (NYSE: IBM ) Watson Health and Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE ) today announced a collaboration that will utilize IBM Watson for Drug Discovery to help accelerate Pfizer's research in immuno-oncology, an approach to cancer treatment that uses the body's immune system to help fight cancer. Pfizer is one of the first organizations worldwide to deploy Watson for Drug Discovery, and the first to customize the cloud-based cognitive tool – tapping in to Watson's machine learning, natural language processing, and other cognitive reasoning technologies to support the identification of new drug targets, combination therapies for study, and patient selection strategies in immuno-oncology.\nImmunotherapies, which modify a patient's immune system to recognize and target cancer cells using a combination of vaccines, immunomodulators, and small/large molecules, are reshaping the field of oncology. Oncology researchers at Pfizer will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze massive volumes of disparate data sources, including licensed and publicly available data as well as Pfizer's proprietary data. With this new tool, Pfizer researchers will analyze and test hypotheses to generate evidence-based insights for real-time interaction. The customized technology can also support efficient safety assessments.\nCancer is one of the leading causes of death worldwide, and is arguably one of the most complex diseases known to mankind. 1 Many researchers believe that the future of immuno-oncology lies in combinations tailored to unique tumor characteristics, which could transform the cancer treatment paradigm and enable more oncology patients to be treated.\n\"Pfizer remains committed to staying at the forefront of immuno-oncology research,\" said Mikael Dolsten, President, Pfizer Worldwide Research & Development. \"With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents. We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson's cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.\"\nLaurie Olson , Executive Vice President, Strategy, Portfolio and Commercial Operations, Pfizer, said, \"At Pfizer, we are entering a new frontier in data innovation in which we are investing in a range of new technologies and digital solutions to help us dynamically mine both internal and external data sources to find new connections in science, as well as help us better understand how diseases progress and how they could potentially be treated. Applying the power of cognitive computing to an area that is a core part of our DNA – discovering new medicines – is helping Pfizer to learn how we can most efficiently discover those immuno-oncology therapies that have the best chance of successful outcomes for patients.\"\nThe newly launched Watson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based offering that aims to help life sciences researchers discover new drug targets and alternative drug indications. The average researcher reads between 200 and 300 articles in a given year 2 , while Watson for Drug Discovery has ingested 25 million Medline abstracts, more than 1 million full-text medical journal articles, 4 million patents and is regularly updated. Watson for Drug Discovery can be augmented with an organization's private data such as lab reports and can help researchers look across disparate data sets to surface relationships and reveal hidden patterns through dynamic visualizations.\n\"We believe that the next great medical innovations will emerge as researchers and scientists find new patterns in existing bodies of knowledge. In order to do this, they need access to R&D tools that can help them efficiently navigate the opportunities and challenges presented by the explosion of data globally,\" said Lauren O'Donnell , Vice President of Life Sciences, IBM Watson Health. \"IBM is honored to collaborate with Pfizer, and put Watson for Drug Discovery to work to support efforts in bringing life-saving immunotherapies to doctors and patients worldwide.\"\nAbout IBM Watson Health\nWatson is the first commercially available cognitive computing capability representing a new era in computing. The system, delivered through the cloud, analyzes high volumes of data, understands complex questions posed in natural language, and proposes evidence-based answers. Watson continuously learns, gaining in value and knowledge over time, from previous interactions. In April 2015 , the company launched IBM Watson Health and the Watson Health Cloud platform. The new unit works with doctors, researchers and insurers to help them innovate by surfacing insights from the massive amount of personal health data being created and shared daily. The Watson Health Cloud can mask patient identities and allow for information to be shared and combined with a dynamic and constantly growing aggregated view of clinical, research and social health data. The Watson Health portfolio includes a variety of data, analytic and cognitive offerings to help life sciences organizations address the complex challenges involved in drug discovery, regulatory compliance, real world evidence and commercial optimization.

      "text": "The fintech ecosystem explained \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Fintech Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nTech giant IBM has been working on making itself a global leader in developing blockchain use cases for financial services, and on Wednesday , it announced yet another project. \nIBM will develop a blockchain-based supply chain finance solution with Mahindra Group, one of India's largest conglomerates, according to Bezinga . \nThe new platform will use a permissioned blockchain and be designed to optimize processes involved in supply chain finance, with particular emphasis on invoice discounting. \nSupply chain financing is typically laborious. Many transactions between suppliers, buyers, and any financing parties involve paper invoices that have to be mailed and require the manual inputting of documents into each participant's respective system. This greatly increases processing times and the risk of human error. \nBlockchain technology is well placed to help mitigate both issues as it can be used to create a shared, immutable ledger that each participant can update instantly, while also limiting each party's access to the parts of the contract related to them. This can reduce human error and operating costs, as well as ensure transparency and the protection of sensitive data. \nIBM has long been upping its blockchain offerings. It's been particularly focused on producing real-world applications for the technology — including in the areas of financial services and trade finance. IBM has made open-source contributions to the Hyperledger Fabric, and in April, it made blockchain services available to its IBM Bluemix cloud users so they could build and test blockchain-based solutions. \nWe think it likely that its real-world approach will give IBM an edge over groups or consortiums working on blockchain technology. In addition, its structure is less fractious, which may make it easier for the firm to specialize and focus on particular use cases. \nBlockchain technology, which is best known for powering Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, is gaining steam among finance firms because of its potential to streamline processes and increase efficiency. The technology could cut costs by up to $20 billion annually by 2022, according to Santander . \nThat's because blockchain, which operates as a distributed ledger, has the ability to allow multiple parties to transfer and store sensitive information in a space that’s secure, permanent, anonymous, and easily accessible. That could simplify paper-heavy, expensive, or logistically complicated financial systems, like remittances and cross-border transfer, shareholder management and ownership exchange, and securities trading, to name a few. And outside of finance, governments and the music industry are investigating the technology’s potential to simplify record-keeping. \nAs a result, venture capital firms and financial institutions alike are pouring investment into finding, developing, and testing blockchain use cases. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, have begun researching the technology in-house, or have helped fund startups with products rooted in blockchain. \nJaime Toplin, research associate for BI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on blockchain technology that explains how blockchain works, why it has the potential to provide a watershed moment for the financial industry, and the different ways it could be put into practice in the coming years. \nBII \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: Spending on capital markets applications of blockchain is expected to grow at a 52% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2019, according to Aite Group, to reach $400 million that year. Banks and major financial institutions are working both collaboratively and independently to develop blockchain tech. Over 50 major financial institutions are involved with collaborative blockchain startups, like R3 CEV or Chain. And many are investing in the technology on their own as well. Putting blockchain to use for real-world transactions is likely not that far off. If working groups' tests are successful, firms could be using it to transact real value as early as the end of this year and we could see widespread industry application within the next few years. \nIn full, the report: Examines the funding increases that are pouring into blockchain Assesses why blockchain is becoming so popular and what factors are driving up increased research and development Explains in full how blockchain technology work and what assets make it valuable and vulnerable Identifies pain points in the financial industry and profiles how various firms are using blockchain to solve them Demonstrates the challenges to mainstream adoption and their potential solutions \nTo get your copy of this invaluable guide, choose one of these options: Subscribe to an ALL-ACCESS Membership with BI Intelligence and gain immediate access to this report AND over 100 other expertly researched deep-dive reports, subscriptions to all of our daily newsletters, and much more. >> START A MEMBERSHIP Purchase the report and download it immediately from our research store. >> BUY THE REPORT \nThe choice is yours.

      "text": "IBM is launching the latest addition to the Watson family: Watson for Drug Discovery, which will use cognitive computing to help researchers zero in on new drug targets. First up is a collaboration with Pfizer, which will use the tech to boost its immuno-oncology research.\nWatson for Drug Discovery is a cloud-based platform that will use deep learning, natural language processing and other cognitive reasoning tech to support researchers seeking new drug targets and new drug indications, IBM said in a statement. The platform has been fed more than 25 million abstracts, more than 1 million full-text journal articles and 4 million patents in order to streamline the drug discovery process. By contrast, a researcher will read between 200 and 300 articles in a given year, according to a 2015 PhRMA report.\nPfizer scientists will use Watson for Drug Discovery to analyze vast amounts of data–including medical literature and Pfizer’s own data–and test hypotheses to identify new drug targets and possible combination therapies for cancer, according to the statement. The platform will also help them select patients for clinical studies.\n“With the incredible volume of data and literature available in this complex field, we believe that tapping into advanced technologies can help our scientific experts more rapidly identify novel combinations of immune-modulating agents,” said Mikael Dolsten, Pfizer’s worldwide R&D chief. “We are hopeful that by leveraging Watson’s cognitive capabilities in our drug discovery efforts, we will be able to bring promising new immuno-oncology therapeutics to patients more quickly.”\nImmunotherapies, which include vaccines, immunomodulators and small and large molecules, induce the immune system to recognize and attack cancer cells. The path forward in immuno-oncology includes matching treatments to specific tumor characteristics, resulting in more cancer patients receiving treatment and more effective treatments.\nIBM has embarked on a number of oncology collaborations, including a $50 million project with the Broad Institute to map out the genomes of thousands of drug-resistant tumors. With Memorial Sloan Kettering, IBM offers Watson for Oncology, which will be deployed in 22 hospitals across China. It analyzes patients’ medical records and provides oncologists with evidence-based treatment options, thanks to training from MSK physicians. And that’s not all: IBM also has versions of Watson for clinical trial matching and genomics. The Department of Veterans Affairs is using the latter to expand access to its cancer precision medicine program.",

      "text": "View All Posts \nInternational Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) has been a frequent member of the Dow Jones Composite Average and one of the most followed stocks on Wall Street. IBM stock sports a market capitalization of $150 billion and has to explore new areas to continue its growth. Luckily for IBM, the company has an ace up its sleeve in the form of Watson. Source: Atomic Taco via Flickr \nThe Jeopardy-winning super computer is pushing International Business Machines into new areas, including its latest launch in autonomous cars. Boosted by Watson, IBM stock looks like a buy. \nWatson is most famous for defeating two Jeopardy champions in a televised three-day event back in 2011. During the competition, Watson beat Ken Jennings and Brad Rutter with a win of $77,147 to $24,000 (Jennings) and $21,600 (Rutter). International Business Machines won $1 million from Watson’s performance, which went to charity. The bigger win for the company was showing off just how powerful its supercomputer was at learning anything fed at it. Watson and Autonomous Cars \nIBM stock could get a boost if the company’s latest push into autonomous cars pays off. The company is starting small by going after the bus market, but its technology could soon find its way into autonomous cars through partnerships with major automobile manufacturers. \nThe Olli driverless transit vehicle was shown off at the Los Angeles Auto Show with full demonstrations. Designed by Local Motors, this is the first product to use Watson in its automotive technology. This autonomous car can transport 12 passengers along pre-determined or on-demand routes at speeds of up to 25 miles per hour. Local Motors calls the vehicle perfect for current bus routes, airports, theme parks or college campuses. 10 Double-Whammy Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2017 \nIBM stock won’t see a huge boost from this early Watson-powered device. The possibilities here are what investors should be excited about when International Business Machines finally lands inside other autonomous cars. \nPerhaps the coolest feature from IBM’s Watson is the ability for passengers to talk to their autonomous car Olli and ask questions about the route, the technology used or recommendations for places to go. Watson acts similar to Apple Inc. ’s (NASDAQ: AAPL ) Siri or Amazon.com, Inc. ’s (NASDAQ: AMZN ) Alexa. \nThe difference here is that International Business Machines’ Watson doesn’t just provide facts, it is able to familiarize itself with the person inside the vehicle and learn patterns that could lead to better feedback and recommendations. \nEarlier this year, Watson software was also used by General Motors Company (NYSE: GM ) for its new OnStar Go platform. The service, which will be available to more than 12 million automobiles, is a “ cognitive mobility platform ”. \nLike Olli, passengers will be able to ask for recommendations and see tailored settings to their habits. This OnStar platform will also use IBM to help launch advertisers and partners, like Mastercard Inc (NYSE: MA ), iHeartRadio and Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE: XOM ). This partnership could be the first of several between GM and International Business Machines. \nIBM has been pushing its internet of things business and is listing automotive as one of the areas on its site. Olli is being rolled out in Washington D.C. and has deals in place with Miami and Las Vegas. This puts autonomous cars on the road using International Business Machines’ Watson as the brains. \nThe internet of things market remains a huge opportunity for IBM stock. The company sees the IOT market hitting $11 trillion by 2025 and 250 million connected vehicles on the road by 2020. That’s why International Business Machines is pushing Watson and its other businesses into connected areas like homes, buildings, retailers and vehicles.",

      "text": "  Thermal putty like substance for ThinkPad t20 I'm repairing an IBM T20. I'm replacing the mother board. I believe I need to replace the dark grey putty in the picture. The metal is aluminum. This heat sink sits over the Intel PIII. What is this stuff called? Where do you recommend I get the stuff? I've looked around. I see thermal grease and thermal pads. I don't think either of these is right. I'd say this stuff is something like thermal putty. Google didn't seem to agree. I even know the IBM part number 05K5751. IBM calls the stuff \"thermal grease\", but it looks and feels like putty. Robert",

      "text": "By Eva Dou\nBEIJING--Tough new Chinese cybersecurity rules are providing a rare, behind-the-scenes look at a regulatory skirmish between U.S. technology companies and Beijing.\nChina is moving to require software companies, network-equipment makers and other technology suppliers to disclose their proprietary source code, the core intellectual property running their software, to prove their products can't be compromised by hackers.\nTech companies are loath to offer up their source code, saying this will heighten the risk of their code falling into the hands of rivals or malefactors--and may not guarantee it is hack-proof. Microsoft Corp., Intel Corp. and International Business Machines Corp. are among those filing objections.\n\"Sharing source code in itself can't prove the capability to be secure and controllable,\" Microsoft wrote in comments released by a government cybersecurity committee in November. \"It only proves there is source code.\"\nIntel said a rule forcing chip makers to disclose the details of their products \"would hurt technological innovation and decrease the security level of products.\"\nThe comments were made in a discussion log made public by Technical Committee 260, the national cybersecurity standards maker, as it released technical parameters of its omnibus cybersecurity law adopted Nov. 7.\nThe committee is rolling out standards for operating systems, microprocessors, office software and other products to comply with the regulations when they go into force in June 2017.\nChinese authorities have said these measures are necessary to guard against foreign espionage tools being embedded in software used here. They frequently cite claims by former U.S. National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that such back doors were routinely built into U.S. technology products sold overseas.\nMicrosoft, Intel and IBM were the largest U.S. firms to respond to the draft regulations, joining dozens of Chinese companies, government agencies and security experts.\nThe three U.S. tech giants declined to comment beyond their written statements. All three have multiple China ventures with local partners and are typically reluctant to publicly challenge Chinese policy. As such, their written comments, made in Chinese, offer a rare glimpse into how they parry over regulations with Beijing authorities.\nAmong other things, tech companies are bristling at the level of detail they would be forced to disclose to have their proprietary technologies rated \"secure and controllable.\"\nMicrosoft wrote that it believed allowing visitors to view code at its new \"Transparency Center\" in Beijing should suffice, rather than having to \"share source code.\" Technical Committee 260 staffers disagreed, maintaining the original wording and marking the comment \"not accepted.\"\nMicrosoft and Intel also raised questions over one security standard that gives a higher ranking to products whose development and delivery can't be disrupted by \"politics,\" with Intel requesting clarification.\nThat complaint was marked \"partially accepted,\" although political consideration is still in the most recent draft.\nIBM said that distinctions should be made between computing services for commercial use, versus services for government applications.\n\"Computing rooms used purely for commercial cloud computing purposes shouldn't have to be located within China's borders,\" wrote IBM.\nIn a written response, Technical Committee 260 staffers said that many sectors touch upon social stability and the public interest. \"It's not only a pure commercial question.\"\nJeremie Waterman, senior director for Greater China at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in Washington, said there is \"deep concern about the IP disclosure requirements.\" But it isn't clear what recourse U.S. tech companies might have.\nDespite any objections, U.S. firms are unlikely to leave China over the cybersecurity requirements because of the importance of the mammoth Chinese market, said James Gong, a senior associate at law firm Herbert Smith Freehills LLP who works with western clients in navigating Chinese law.\n\"I don't think they will pull out,\" said Mr. Gong. \"I haven't heard of any company that has decided to leave.\"\nChina has long had cybersecurity standards that weren't vigorously enforced--but that is likely to change when the nationwide cybersecurity law goes into effect next summer, he said.\nBeijing maintains that its security rules apply to domestic and foreign companies equally.

      "text": "Erich Bloch, IBM mainframe pioneer, dies at 91 Erich Bloch, IBM mainframe pioneer, dies at 91 Mainframe computers he helped to develop ushered in the modern computing era. \nErich Bloch was a pioneer in IBM mainframe development. Photo by IBM \nErich Bloch, who helped develop the IBM mainframe that changed the face of computing, has died. He was 91. \nBloch died November 25 in Washington from complications of Alzheimer's disease, his daughter, Rebecca Rosen, told the Washington Post . \nThe mainframe computers Bloch helped to develop ushered in the modern computing era, providing a cornerstone that allows us to perform a variety of tasks on the internet, including shopping, banking and making airline reservations, among many others. \nBloch was born on January 9, 1925, in Sulzburg, Germany, and immigrated to the US in 1948 after being orphaned during the Holocaust. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Buffalo while working days as a research assistant in a laboratory and taking classes at night. \nIn the mid-1950s, Bloch contributed to the development of the IBM 7030, a supercomputer popularly known as \"Stretch\" that could perform 100 billion computations a day and handle half a million instructions per second. It was about 30 to 40 times faster than other systems, but IBM discontinued the Stretch after shipping only nine systems to quell charges that it exerted monopoly control over the computer market. \nThe Stretch paved the way for the development of IBM's System/360, developed in part by Bloch and the late Bob Evans . The 360 name was chosen for the system because its software architecture was meant to address all possible customer needs. The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., dubbed the s/360 the \" most successful computer system of all time.\" \nIBM's then-CEO, Thomas Watson Jr., is said to have \"bet the company\" on development of the S/360, the ancestor to today's mainframes. IBM invested $5 billion in the project at a time when the company's annual revenue came to $3.2 billion. \nThose systems laid the groundwork for the modern PC, which have succeeded by miniaturizing much of the technology he and his colleagues created, Bloch said at the museum in 2004. \n\"The first 30 years of computing is what most of the work going on today is based on,\" he said. \"What you see today is a reflection of the fact those systems we developed were built to be durable and flexible.\" \nAfter retiring from IBM in 1984, Bloch was appointed director of the National Science Foundation by President Ronald Reagan. During his six-year term, he oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern internet. Share your voice",

From the article: \"In the 1950s, he developed the first ferrite-core memory storage units to be used in computers commercially and worked on the IBM 7030 , known as Stretch, the first transistorized supercomputer. 'Asked what job each of us had, my answer was very simple and very direct,' Mr. Bloch said in 2002. 'Getting that sucker working.' Mr. Bloch's role was to oversee the development of Solid Logic Technology -- half-inch ceramic modules for the microelectronic circuitry that provided the System/360 with superior power, speed and memory, all of which would become fundamental to computing.\"",

      "text": "Price $ 1,500.00 Abstract \nThis IDC Energy Insights Perspective examines the use of IBM's Watson Data Platform in the oil and gas sector. IBM announced the Watson Data Platform as a tool to help companies gain strategic value in oil and gas exploration. There are vast amounts of \"dark\" data generated in the oilfield that can be analyzed to rapidly make important operational and business decisions. Many times, exploration companies wrestle with large amounts of structured and unstructured data, along with the ability to put that data into business context. Typically, these companies do not have the knowledge or skills to leverage, manage, and fully exploit the data they collect. IDC Energy Insights estimates that 80% of the data a company collects sits idle and unexploited, adding little value to the business. In This Perspective | Learn More Subscriptions Covered",

      "text": "News Ulster Town Board rejects TechCity’s renewal of demolition permit at former IBM site Tania Barricklo - Daily FreemanDebris from a demolished building at TechCity, the former IBM complex in the town of Ulster, is removed last month. By William J. Kemble, # Comments \nTOWN OF ULSTER >> The Town Board has rejected TechCity’s effort to renew a demolition permit to demolish a remaining section of Building 034 in the former IBM complex. \nAt a board meeting Thursday, town officials said they are dissatisfied that demolition debris remains at the site more than a year after the initial permit was approved. \n“They’ve been bringing in one little truck, a big truck, a little truck,” town Councilman Rocco Secreto said. \nTown Supervisor James Quigley said TechCity owner Alan Ginsberg has been unable to provide an accurate scheduled for the demolition and board members are unwilling to allow more debris to sit on the site. Advertisement \n“His comments all along have been, ‘We’ll be done by the end of the year,’” Quigley said. “Well, I asked TechCity’s management (on Wednesday) whether they’re going to be done by the end of the year, and he said he didn’t know. We have one more (board) meeting before the end of the year and after I get a report back ... we’ll have another discussion.” \nTown officials in September 2015 approved demolition permits for seven buildings without requiring a cleanup plan for the property. They noted that a debris removal deadline had not been requested because there has never previously been a project of that size as a precedent. \nBuildings that were scheduled to come down are B025, 277,571 square feet; B002, containing 48,267 square feet; B003, containing 274,291 square feet; B004, containing 41,748 square feet; B034, containing 8,364 square feet; and B035, containing 18,181 square feet. B001, with 274,928 square feet, was included in the permit but has not been removed. \nQuigley said state Department of Environmental Conservation inspectors are scheduled to be on the site Friday to examine concrete debris that has been lying in piles for months. \n“They are trying to get DEC ... to say that the materials are free of contamination and can be used for suitable fill,” he said. “They were able to conclude that the concrete is capable of being removed and a buyer came along and they started that process and they accelerated some of the work in the back I think the board would consider doing something. But right now they’re not happy with the progress.” \nA state report in January 2014 on contamination at the site have specifically identified Building 001 as being above the middle of a groundwater contamination plume that had spread underneath nearly the entire east campus of the site when it was an IBM manufacturing facility. \n“Through a combination of groundwater and subsurface soil sampling, a contaminant source area was identified at a solid waste management unit ... in building B001,” the report said. “The contaminant in this source area is undiluted trichloroethane. The undiluted contaminant is approximately 20 (to) 25 feet below the surface.”",

      "text": "Erich Bloch was a pioneer in IBM mainframe development.\nPhoto by IBM Erich Bloch, who helped develop the IBM mainframe that changed the face of computing, has died. He was 91.\nBloch died November 25 in Washington from complications of Alzheimer's disease, his daughter, Rebecca Rosen, told the Washington Post .\nThe mainframe computers Bloch helped to develop ushered in the modern computing era, providing a cornerstone that allows us to perform a variety of tasks on the internet, including shopping, banking and making airline reservations, among many others.\nBloch was born on January 9, 1925, in Sulzburg, Germany, and immigrated to the US in 1948 after being orphaned during the Holocaust. He earned a bachelor's degree in electrical engineering from the University of Buffalo while working days as a research assistant in a laboratory and taking classes at night.\nIn the mid-1950s, Bloch contributed to the development of the IBM 7030, a supercomputer popularly known as \"Stretch\" that could perform 100 billion computations a day and handle half a million instructions per second. It was about 30 to 40 times faster than other systems, but IBM discontinued the Stretch after shipping only nine systems to quell charges that it exerted monopoly control over the computer market.\nThe Stretch paved the way for the development of IBM's System/360, developed in part by Bloch and the late Bob Evans . The 360 name was chosen for the system because its software architecture was meant to address all possible customer needs. The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif., dubbed the s/360 the \" most successful computer system of all time.\"\nIBM's then-CEO, Thomas Watson Jr., is said to have \"bet the company\" on development of the S/360, the ancestor to today's mainframes. IBM invested $5 billion in the project at a time when the company's annual revenue came to $3.2 billion.\nThose systems laid the groundwork for the modern PC, which have succeeded by miniaturizing much of the technology he and his colleagues created, Bloch said at the museum in 2004.\n\"The first 30 years of computing is what most of the work going on today is based on,\" he said. \"What you see today is a reflection of the fact those systems we developed were built to be durable and flexible.\"\nAfter retiring from IBM in 1984, Bloch was appointed director of the National Science Foundation by President Ronald Reagan. During his six-year term, he oversaw the creation of NSFNET, a precursor to the modern internet.\n ",

      "text": "Trumping Donald Trump : IBM and The Drum use AI to analyse the president-elect's social traits By Staff Writer  59pm Donald gets the Top Trump treatment: IBM and The Drum use AI to analyse the president-elect's social traits \nThe Drum, IBM and the makers of Top Trumps have analysed the Twitter personality of US president-elect Donald Trump. \nIn order to Top Trump Trump The Drum used artificial intelligence to grant a definitive score of the real estate mogul's online marketing traits, and follows on from The Drum's original Top Trump Super Marketers online game which was created as part of our special AI issue guest-edited by IBM's Watson earlier this year. \nThe game provides scores for six personality traits including: cheerfulness, assertiveness, altruism, fieriness, adventurousness and overall. Players are then given the opportunity to compare their social ratings against similarly ranked individuals. \nTrump has been extremely active on Twitter, and as such achieved a high score across the board, attaining an average of 69 out of a possible 100. In terms of cheerfulness the former Apprentice host clocked up a score of 61. He received a high rating for assertiveness at 98, while for altruism he was awarded a score of 96 - a figure that may not come as too much of a surprise to his critics. In the final category, fieriness, Trump was presented with a disappointing four out of 100, which may come as a shock to some given his impassioned slights against his rival Hillary Clinton in the run up to the US election. \nYou can view Trump's card in full above. \nSeparately, The Drum has today (2 December) extended its Super Marketers game to the 300 attendees of the Digital Podge , which each poised to receive individual Top Trump cards produced by Winning Moves. \nThe data is based on analysis of each player's Twitter profile, and the people deemed with the best trait in each category will receive a special prize at this year's Podge lunch. However, according to editor in chief Gordon Young, there will be special tie breaks created should anybody get the same score. \n\"The most cheerful person will be asked to tell a joke, or most adventurous a tale of dare and do,\" explained Young, looking to build competition. \nNon attendees of the lunch can also play online , generating a virtual card which may seem them recognised as having the best personality in the business at the end of the year, based on Watson's analysis. \n  Top Trumps , Donald Trump , Artificial Intelligence (AI) , Social Media , Digital Staff Writer \nThe Drum is all about modern marketing and media.

      "text": "Feature Why AWS is the IBM for the cloud computing age Scalable cloud computing that helps businesses get up and running quickly and securely means you'll never get fired for buying Amazon Web Services. Senior Writer, CIO | Dec 2, 2016 6:56 AM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: Thinkstock Does the Cloud Free up the Enterprise? \nAmazon Web Services (AWS) has emerged as the top infrastructure-as-a-service provider for large enterprises because of its stability and security, rich feature set, and track record hosting critical applications for enterprises. But its success isn’t based strictly on technology: It's also become strategic in hiring former CIOs and CTOs to sell skeptical prospective customers. \nThat reality was clear this week at AWS's customer event where Capital One announced that it had made AWS its predominant provider of cloud software through 2022 -- a five year extension of a two-year deal it inked last year. \"This was a strategic decision by us that AWS is an important partner for us and we're willing to sign on for a longer term,\" Capital One CIO Rob Alexander tells CIO.com. \"Given their scale, pace of innovation and their customer orientation and the breadth of services we feel like they're the right partner for us.\" Capital One \nCapital One CIO Rob Alexander. \nOnly a few years ago, AWS was a vendor that attracted startups such as Uber, Airbnb, Dollar Shave Club and others and a platform where developers working for large enterprises could to test their applications. Soon CIOs saw the speed with which their developers provisioned computing power and they began to think bigger: If they could run production workloads in AWS they could get out the business of running data centers. \nToday, AWS is generating $13 billion a year in business, thanks to major deals with marquis customers such as Capital One , Matson , Under Armour , Liberty Mutual and several other big-name brands. And just as Big Blue once cultivated a reputation so sterling that it gave rise to the axiom “no one ever got fired for buying IBM,” today CIOs know they y won't get canned for buying AWS. Flipping the public cloud switch \nLike many CIOs, Capital One’s Alexander was building a private cloud a few years ago. But he quickly scrapped those plans when he realized that public cloud services could offer better computing systems without the headaches of maintaining and supporting them. Developers convinced him that AWS was a worthy platform to consider. \"It was that groundswell that initially led us to this partnership in 2015 and had sustained us and caused us to reinvest in that,\" Alexander says. \n[ Related: Cool tech at AWS re:Invent ] \nCapital One hopes to reduce its data center footprint from eight facilities in 2014 to three by 2018. This will allow its thousands of software engineers to focus on building digital banking services, using machine learning capabilities better meet consumer preferences, as CIO.com reported last month . \nShipping carrier Matson is also betting big on AWS, announcing this week that it has closed all four of its on-premises data centers. It uses AWS to track shipping vessels and containers and run its custom-built order-to-cash booking and billing systems, terminal operations, global equipment management, logistics applications and customer website. Matson CIO Peter Weis says it marks the culmination of a years-long IT modernization project. “Having moved 100 percent of our enterprise applications from on-premises data centers to the AWS Cloud, we are now free to focus on further innovation,\" Weis said in a statement. \nSome CIOs prize AWS for its capability to help them get applications up and running rapidly and reduce capacity to match business cadence. Western Digital \nSteve Phillpott, CIO of Western Digital. \nAs the CIO of Hitachi Global Data Storage in 2013, Steve Phillpott used AWS to quickly spin up computing power to analyze manufacturing data on hard drives. Expediency and agility became more crucial as HGST merged with Western Digital, which in turn acquired SanDisk. Today, as the CIO of the combined Western Digital entity, Phillpott says he operates one of the largest instances of Cloudera Hadoop in AWS to run engineering simulations. \n\"On big data projects, you really need iterative development -- get something up and running, add, test, in little sprints,\" Phillpott tells CIO.com. \"The Amazon environment allowed us to get something up and running quickly.\" Conversely, AWS also made it easy for the company to reduce the number of servers used for computations with a few button clicks. \"The flexibility I get from AWS architecture is really beneficial. That's important because the Big Data space is changing so fast and we're constantly adding new data sources.\" How AWS is winning over CIOs with CIOs \nSpeed, agility, time to market and other characteristics are table stakes for public cloud services. What makes AWS so attractive is its maturity -- it's been around since 2006 -- as well as its fast pace of innovation, and, crucially, its proven track record hosting production apps for enterprises, says Lydia Leong, a Gartner analyst who covers the cloud computing market. A rich partner ecosystem and certification programs to train-up staff who lack experience working with cloud software also help, Leong says. “It’s leading-edge, feels safe and lots of help is readily available for customers,” Leong says. \nThere is another, less obvious reason for AWS' success: In recent years it has quietly stacked its bench with former IT leaders who have implemented its technology. For instance, Dow Jones Stephen Orban became AWS’ global head of enterprise strategy in 2014. Douglas Menefee left his role as CIO of Schumacher Group to become an enterprise CIO advisor at AWS before leaving in 2015. \nMost recently, there was the under-the-radar hire of Adrian Cockroft as vice president of cloud architecture in October . Cockroft became something a cloud computing wizard during his time as Netflix’ cloud architect, overseeing the creation of several open source tools that manage virtual servers in a cloud native architecture. Today Netflix operates its entire business on AWS . \nLining up such talent makes for a valuable tool to bring new customers into the fold, says Capital One’s Alexander. He says that transitioning to the cloud requires overcoming conventional wisdom and influencing very senior leaders, who then have to influence other executives, board members and regulators and make the case for why this is a sound strategy. “The ability to have folks who can speak that language, help develop arguments and make that case is a helpful approach for a company like AWS to be able to sell their services,” Alexander says.

      "title": "There's only one tech CEO on Trump's economic advisory team — and she's not from Silicon Valley (IBM)",
      "text": "print IBM CEO Ginni Rometty. IBM \nPresident-elect Donald Trump has created a new advisory group of business leaders to \"frequently\" advise him on economic matters. \nThe list includes big names like Jack Welch, the former Chairman and CEO of General Electric, Jamie Dimon, the Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase & Co and Bob Iger, The Walt Disney Company Chairman and CEO. \nBut there is only CEO from the tech industry. IBM's Ginni Rometty. \nRometty is an interesting choice for a lot of reasons. She's not from the center of the tech universe, Silicon Valley. IBM is headquartered in New York. We don't know if she knows Trump personally or not, but as a fellow New Yorker, its likely they've at least hobnobbed a time or two. \nRometty is a bona fide geek who definitely has a vision for how tech is going to change the world. She calls it \"cognitive computing\" and she believes the day is coming when humans will consult thinking, learning, rational computers for every decision that they make. She's sees this brave new computing world changing actually \"changing who you are,\" she's said in various keynote speeches. \nAnd IBM under Rometty has publicly taken stances regarding potentially discriminatory state laws. Her name was among 80 who signed a letter asking North Carolina to repeal its controversial bathroom law, which forbids transgender people from using bathrooms based on their gender identify and also forbids local governments from creating other ordinances that outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation or identity. At odds on outsourcing \nOn the other hand, IBM, particularly under her leadership, is a classic global American company that routinely lays off US workers . The company employs about 380,000 people and in 2010 it stopped disclosing its US headcount , amidst criticisms that it has been offshoring jobs to countries like India. \nThis is the kind of thing Trump campaigned against. He even criticized IBM's layoffs i n a Nov. 6 campaign speech in Minnesota, the Wall Street Journal reported. \nShortly after Trump won the election, Rometty penned an open letter to him . \nIn it, she praised his ideas and suggested that the federal government (which is a huge IBM customer) buy more IBM technology in the future. She gave pitches on hiring IBM to \"fight government waste\" and to help the Department of Veterans Affairs with its health care issues. \nShe also suggested Trump focus on vocational training as an alternative to college, offering IBM's model of 6-year high-schools as a model. And she applauded his tax reform ideas, which promise to cut corporate taxes and allow companies to bring home their offshored cash hoards at a low tax rate, too. \nThe letter didn't, however, mention any of his campaign positions on social issues that were the subject of protests and riots nationwide at the time. \nAnd that caused one IBM employee to write her own open letter to Rometty to announce her resignation in protest of Rometty's letter to Trump. The employee's letter went viral . It accused IBM under Rometty of \" a willingness to legitimize threats to our country for financial gain.\" \nSo all-in-all, a very interesting choice of the CEO selected to represent the tech industry. \nHere's the full list from a press release issued by Blackstone. Stephen Schwarzman (forum chairman) , chairman, CEO, and cofounder of Blackstone Paul Atkins , CEO of Patomak Global Partners, former commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission Mary Barra , chairwoman and CEO, General Motors Toby Cosgrove , CEO, Cleveland Clinic Jamie Dimon , chairman and CEO, JPMorgan Chase & Co. Larry Fink , chairman and CEO, BlackRock Bob Iger , chairman and CEO, The Walt Disney Company Rich Lesser , president and CEO, Boston Consulting Group Doug McMillon , president and CEO, Wal-Mart Stores Inc. Jim McNerney , former chairman, president, and CEO of Boeing Adebayo \"Bayo\" Ogunlesi , chairman and managing partner, Global Infrastructure Partners Ginni Rometty , chairwoman, president, and CEO of IBM Kevin Warsh , Shepard Family Distinguished Visiting Fellow in economics at the Hoover Institute, former member of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System Mark Weinberger , global chairman and CEO, EY Jack Welch , former chairman and CEO, General Electric Daniel Yergin , Pulitzer Prize winner, vice chairman of IHS Markit",

      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nA new software development technique promises to end destructive exploits from hackers. The concept is to continually, and repeatedly, rearrange the program’s code while it’s running—and do it very quickly. Doing that shuts down the hacker’s “window of opportunity” because he doesn’t know where to find bugs to hit with his poisonous attack. The scrambling occurs over milliseconds. \nCode reuse attacks are the kind of harmful exploits that can be stopped dead in their tracks, researchers say in an article on Columbia University’s website . \nShuffler, as the new cybersecurity program is called, “continuously re-randomizes code-locations” so that Just-in-Time Return-Oriented Programming (JIT-ROP) attacks can’t take place. Those attacks are where memory disclosures are used to discover buggy, exploitable code during runtime, the scientists explain in their paper (pdf). + Also on Network World: IBM sets up test range to practice fighting nightmare cyber battles safely + \nA similar technique, one of rearranging memory when a program launches, called Address Space Layout Randomization (ASLR) had been used successfully to confuse hacks in the past. \nHowever, the usual bugs in code have provided an entry for rancorous exploits. The researchers say software typically contains 50 mistakes for every 1,000 lines of code. \nHackers get around ASLR through exploitation of those errors. It’s something ASLR doesn’t stop. \n“Hackers soon discovered they could exploit memory disclosure bugs to grab code fragments once the program was already running,” the Columbia University article says. How Shuffler works \nThe researchers' invention promises to end that. Shuffler takes ASLR’s randomizing and super-charges it by mixing up code every 20 to 50 milliseconds. That’s a deadline to a hacker’s work. Any information gleaned by the hacker from a server is out of date already by the time the ne’er do well gets it. \nBy the time the actor can act, “Shuffler has already relocated the respective code snippets to different memory locations,” says study co-author Vasileios Kemerlis, of Brown University, in the article. \nSomething else that’s clever about it is that the Shuffler software randomizes itself while running alongside the program it’s coddling. Hackers shouldn’t be able to get in that way, either. \nThe researchers say their system works better than anything that has been tried before in the same vein, such as MIT Lincoln Labs' continuously randomizing TASR and Florida State University’s Remix . They’re too slow and need too many system changes, they say. \nSlowness is indeed a drawback to all of these kinds of programs. The physical act of the arrangement takes time. Shuffler slows things down 15 percent on average unless one uses copious computer power, the researchers say. Servers running 12 cores improve matters, they say. \nThe researchers say they still have a bit of work to do before they’re ready to release Shuffler. One vulnerability still not fully resolved is related to server-crash exploits. \n“Billions of lines of vulnerable code are out there,” says study senior author, Junfeng Yang, of Columbia and member of the Data Science Institute, talking of the penetration route that hackers use to get in. \nA final version of Shuffler could avoid the need to find all those bugs. \nThis article is published as part of the IDG Contributor Network.

      "text": "IBM opens 'cyber-range' to practice security battles \nWhat could possibly be creepier than a government organization (such as the NSA) having nearly unlimited access to your private, personal information (including access to your webcam)? \nTurns out, the answer is: when it gets turned into a video game. And it appears, they have done this. \nOn Dec. 1, 2016, Wikileaks released a collection of documents relating to the German parliament inquiry of the cooperation between the German foreign intelligence agency (the BND) and the United States’ NSA. \nOne particular document (pdf) within that collection caught my attention. It appears to be a report from an official at the European Cryptologic Center (ECC) from April 13, 2012, detailing how they can improve usage of Xkeyscore (XKS) to collect information about people. \n[The document in question has been reviewed before , so this isn’t new information. It merely came to my attention via the WikiLeaks BND/NSA collection. Why this particular document and topic isn’t being talked about more actively by the press is somewhat baffling.] \nLet’s go over this bit by bit. \n“Combine these exciting finds with the introduction of XKS Skilz points, and you can see why McDonald’s teamed up with Monopoly years ago: people buy more and even super size their orders just to get game pieces. With the brainchild of Skilz, where analysts can earn points and unlock achievements for performing tasks in XKS, people are willing to try new things within the tool. Analysts think to themselves, ‘Using the Pivot Data feature will earn 30 points… I’m going to try it and see what happens.’ Discovery! Points! We have been lured by our geeky desire to unlock achievements and earn points, and bragging rights are everything.” \nYou read that right. According to this document, using XKS to collect data (aka “spy”) on people has been turned into a game. With “Skilz” points. Note the super-hip spelling of “Skilz” with only one L and the oh-so-cutting-edge Z at the end. \nAnd there are “Achievements” to unlock. Queue all of the jokes along the lines of “Achievement Unlocked: Look at a child through a webcam without anyone finding out!” \nLet’s keep reading: \n“Definitely a number of users have gotten into the Skilz points. We have several people at level six. They see what they need to do to earn more points and start trying out different things.” \nSo, the gaming system had been implemented (as of 2012) and was in active use. And there are at least six levels. \n“With traditional targeting, analysts cast their nets wide into the murky waters of network traffic and haul in anything that gets caught in the net. We are like Forrest Gump on his shrimping boat off the coast of Alabama pulling in a boot, toilet seat, seaweed, and there they are… three shrimp!” \nIn short: The approach is to collect as much data on individuals as possible, then hope there’s something in there you can use (aka “shrimp”). This has been known for quite some time, but this is the first time I’ve seen a Forrest Gump-based metaphor used to describe it. \n“Maybe XKS is a seven-headed dragon as [redacted] mentioned. Big and scary? Sure. Strong and powerful? Oh yeah. But the ECC is taming it, and it is ours to do with whatever we like, including catching shrimp.” \nIt is theirs “to do with whatever [they] like.” That statement reads like something a creepy super-villain from a Bond movie would say. \nIt’s almost as if turning this massively powerful surveillance tool (XKS) into a video game has in some way desensitized those using it—causing them to feel like the targets are not real people anymore, simply characters in a video game that must be spied on in order to get more points, levels and achievements. \nIn short: Collecting personal data on you is now a video game being played by government agencies that feel they can do whatever they want with their “game.” “Skilz” seems sort of like FarmVille , except instead of planting crops, you’re spying on people. At least that’s the way it appears. To comment on this article and other Network World content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter stream . Related:",
