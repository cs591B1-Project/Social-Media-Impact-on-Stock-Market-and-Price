      "text": "show chapters Gerber on Apple: Google taking its lunch      3 Hours Ago | 03:32 Apple 's stock hasn't reaped much from the postelection rally, but this holiday season, shoppers still want iPhones, according to Piper Jaffray analyst Gene Munster. \nA Piper Jaffray retail survey of 1,000 consumers showed that iPhones and Macs were the top-requested gifts among consumers and had increased in popularity from last year. \n\"I understand the theme is, 'it's not as exciting,' but consumers definitely want to be buying these iPhones,\" Munster told   \" on Black Friday, one of the year's busiest shopping days.\nDespite the apparent popularity of Apple's new products, shares of the company have fallen 1.5 percent so far this month, during a period where the S&P 500 has risen 4 percent. \nOne Apple shareholder was not pleased with Apple's position, citing the limited availability of the jet black iPhone 7 Plus and a dearth of innovative new hardware. He called the company's marketing \"out of touch.\" \n\n\"They have manufacturing issues, they have issues in China, they got a stronger dollar that's going to hurt foreign sales,\" Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an independent investment advisor, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \"We're very disappointed with management. It's just so disappointing to have nothing, absolutely nothing new.\" \nGerber said Google and Microsoft , who have led the way on smart home devices and virtual reality, are \"taking [Apple]'s lunch.\" But Munster said that Wall Street's view of the stock misses the forest for the trees. This month, Microsoft shares have risen 1 percent, while Google parent Alphabet has fallen 3.7 percent. \n\"At the end of the day, maybe the features weren't as exciting as they have been in the past,\" Munster said. \"The iPhone is a product that people want.\" \nDisclosure: Piper Jaffray makes a market in shares of Apple.",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nSamsung expected to rebound next year as recall costs subside\nApple Inc. took a record majority of world-wide smartphone profit share in the third quarter as Samsung Electronics Co. Ltd. plunged in the wake of the disastrous Note 7 recall.\nIn the quarter, which included Samsung's first and second recalls and the discontinuation of the exploding Note 7's production (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/samsung-kills-off-galaxy-note-7-smartphone-after-botched-recall-2016-10-11), Samsung's (005930.SE) global profit share fell from nearly a third, 31.2% in the prior quarter, to absolutely nothing. That sent the profit share of its largest competitor, Apple (AAPL) , to a record 91%, compared with 62.2% in the second quarter, according to Strategy Analytics. Rounding out the top four in terms of profitability were three Chinese companies: Huawei, Vivo and OPPO, though their shares were all under 2.5%.\nRead also: Here's how much Apple may profit from Samsung's exploding phone disaster (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-could-sell-another-15-million-iphones-because-of-samsungs-note-7-explosions-2016-10-10)\nSamsung's share of total industry profits is expected to rebound in 2017 as it continues to move past the recall and associated costs, according to Linda Sui, director of wireless smartphone strategies at Strategy Analytics, a consumer electronics trends tracker.\nApple typically holds a larger share of profits because of its ability to charge industry-leading premium prices on devices. Samsung is the bigger revenue generator in the smartphone market overall, though, because of its larger world-wide user base.\n(https://w.graphiq.com/w/7TUYEw5IkZv)\nBoth Apple and Samsung suffered year-over-year smartphone sales declines last quarter, while Samsung held on to its industry-leading share of world-wide revenues, according to IDC. Many analysts suspected that iOS would benefit from a flurry of Android switchers in the wake of the exploding phone saga, but many users seem to have stuck with Alphabet Inc.'s (GOOGL) (GOOGL) Android operating system, fleeing to either Samsung's other Galaxy phones or Android devices offered by rival manufacturers like HTC Corp. (2498.TW) and LG Electronics Inc. (066570.SE)\nSee also: Why everything from Samsung phones to hoverboards is literally exploding (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-everything-from-samsung-phones-to-hoverboards-are-literally-exploding-2016-09-02)\nSamsung shipped 72.5 million phones in the third quarter, for 20% revenue share, while Apple sold 45.5 million phones, giving it 12.5% share, according to IDC. By revenue, Samsung is the largest smartphone manufacturer, followed by Apple, Huawei, OPPO then Vivo.\nThe Note 7 debacle is the primary reason for the huge decline in Samsung's smartphone profitability last quarter, but that is viewed by analysts largely as a temporary hiccup that the South Korean company will overcome in the coming quarters.\n\"Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost\" has given iPhone the ability to \"generate monster profits,\" Sui said. \"The Note 7 recall significantly cracked Samsung smartphone profit margin this quarter. [But] we expect Samsung will come back in 2017.\"\nIn a late-October survey taken by IDC, analysts said Samsung faces some short-term challenges but \"nothing that will darken its long-term prospects.\"\n\"Although the recall may have an adverse impact on the brand in the short term, the truth is that Samsung remains the clear market leader world-wide,\" said Anthony Scarsella, research manager in IDC's mobile phones unit.\nRead also: Apple faces decade of uncertainty after next year's iPhone (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-faces-decade-of-uncertainty-after-next-years-iphone-2016-11-21)\nIn late October, Samsung reported a nearly 17% decline in net profit to 4.54 trillion Korean won ($4 billion), with the vast majority of the declines coming from its mobile unit, which recorded a 96% plunge in operating profit (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/samsung-profit-plunges-after-galaxy-note-7-recall-2016-10-26). The company said it anticipated another 3.5 trillion won in expenses from the recall in the last three months of 2016 and the first three months of 2017. But costs are expected to subside by the middle of next year.\nMeanwhile, Samsung benefits from many other products outside of its mobile unit that insulated the company from an even bigger decline in profits. The company's display panels earned 1.02 trillion won last quarter, a 10% year-over-year increase, while semiconductors and display panels accounted for 84% of Samsung's overall operating profit, the highest level in several years.\n-Jennifer Booton; 1426ET\n ",

      "text": "By Jennifer Booton, MarketWatch\nYou'll find better iPad, Apple Watch and MacBook deals at partner distributors than on Apple.com\nApple Inc. devices are proving popular this Black Friday weekend, but iPads and Watches are actually cheaper at Apple's big-box retail partners than they are when bought directly from the manufacturer, which is hosting its own one-day online shopping event.\nEarlier this week, Apple (AAPL) announced that it would be hosting a one-time shopping event the Friday after Thanksgiving after skipping the event in 2015. Details on the company's ad for the event were scarce, but Apple teased it with a photo of the Apple Watch, spurring rumors that it might discount hardware, a break from the past practice of offering deals on gift cards. The company also teased free two-day shipping, mirroring Amazon Prime (AMZN) and certain partner distributors.\nOpinion: Why Black Friday sales aren't for the truly frugal (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/why-black-friday-sales-are-not-for-the-truly-frugal-2016-11-20)\nThis year, however, proved to be more of the same, with Apple offering Apple gift cards on select products bought at full price. In other words, a shopper spends just as much money now as they would have yesterday on certain devices to get a store discount for a later purchase. But even after subtracting the Apple gift card from the regular retail price, certain devices are actually cheaper at Best Buy Co. (BBY) and Target Corp. (TGT) today than they are shopping directly at Apple.com.\nAlso Read:Apple products and TVs the big drivers for Target's Thanksgiving sales (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-products-and-tvs-are-the-big-drivers-for-targets-thanksgiving-sales-2016-11-25)\nWhen taking advantage of Apple's deals, a full-price iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus yields a $50 gift card; a full-price iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4 comes with a $100 gift card; a full-priced Apple Watch Series 1 includes a $25 gift card; and a full-priced MacBook, MacBook Pro 13-inch, MacBook Pro 15-inch; MacBook Air and iMac yields a $150 gift card.\n(https://sw.graphiq.com/w/fHOgRV4WCcl)\nBreaking this down further, the iPad Air 2 Wi-Fi 32-gigabyte costs $274.99 at Best Buy and $274 at Target, compared with $399 at Apple, or $349 when including the $50 gift card.\nThe Apple Watch Series 1 rose gold model with a sport band is $219 at Best Buy and $198 at Target, compared with $269 at Apple, or $244 when including the $25 gift card.\nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro with 8GB of memory is $1,099.99 at Best Buy and $1,149 at New York-based consumer tech retailer B&H, compared with $1,299 at Apple, or $1,149 when including the gift card. The MacBook isn't sold at Target.\nAlso See:Dow, S&P 500 hit new record in quiet postholiday trading (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/dow-poised-for-fresh-record-highs-black-friday-boost-in-view-2016-11-25)\nThe only time going straight to Apple is better is if you're buying an older-model iPhone. The iPhone 6s Plus 32GB rose gold, for example, is $649 at Apple.com, or $599 including the gift card. That's compared with a retail price of $699.99 at Best Buy.\nFor the iPhone 7, however, the deal is better at Best Buy, with Apple selling its newest iPhone at full price and Best Buy offering discounts and e-gift cards on certain models. The iPhone 7 black 128GB, for example, is $36.58 a month for 24 months with the iPhone upgrade program, or $749 retail when purchased at Apple.com, whereas Best Buy is offering it for $31.25 a month for 24 months along with a $100 Best Buy e-gift card.\nAlso Read:U.S. online sales tally more than $1 billion on Thanksgiving Day (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/us-online-sales-tally-more-than-1-billion-on-thanksgiving-day-2016-11-25)\nApple has been trying to boost device sales after suffering recent declines in hardware, which are its largest source of revenue. The company reported its first-ever annual decline in iPhone sales last month. This has prompted the company in recent months to shift the conversation on its earnings conference calls to services, which now make more money than the Mac family, while analysts have started to question the company's ability to innovate on pace with its biggest rivals (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/apple-faces-decade-of-uncertainty-after-next-years-iphone-2016-11-21)in certain areas such as augmented reality and television. The company's much-hyped BlueTooth AirPods (http://www.marketwatch.com/story/you-will-lose-your-159-apple-airpods-says-everyone-on-the-internet-2016-09-07), meanwhile, still aren't available.\nShares of Apple rose 0.3% to $111.52 in late-morning trade Friday, while those of Best Buy fell 0.3% to $46.83 and Target's rose 0.4% to $78.79 -- all on unusually light volume given the holiday.\nApple's shares have risen 3.7% in the past three months, but remain down 5.5% in the past year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , meanwhile, is up 3.7% in the past three months and up 7.4% in the past year. The S&P 500 has gained 8% on the year.\n-Jennifer Booton; 1616ET\n ",

      "text": "AUSTIN, Texas — During the presidential campaign, Donald Trump complained that the United States had lost too many manufacturing jobs and promised to force big companies like Apple to bring that work home. [...] opening a smartphone factory in this country is not the only way to provide solid employment for working-class Americans who lack college degrees. Apple’s rapid growth in central Texas, where it employs about 6,000 people, up from 2,100 seven years ago, provides a window into the vast constellation of jobs at the world’s largest technology company and their economic impact. At Apple’s sparkling new complex in northwest Austin, workers who are spread throughout seven limestone-and-glass buildings field about 8,000 customer tech-support calls a day, manage the company’s vast network of suppliers and figure out how to move around millions of iPhones a week to ensure they get into the hands of customers when they want them. Employees help run the iTunes Store and the App Store, handle the billions of dollars going in and out of U.S. operations, and continuously update the Maps software that is integral to iPhones and iPads. When employees are not working, they can lounge on chairs shaded from the Texas sun, dine at a two-story cafeteria that serves an abundance of food, including barbecue ribs and banana-bread gelato, and visit a full-service medical clinic, which includes dentists, acupuncturists and a robot-assisted pharmacy. Apple says that, excluding benefits and stock compensation, the average salary of its Austin employees, including management, is $77,000 a year. “Apple has created over 2 million jobs in the United States since the introduction of the iPhone nine years ago, including explosive growth in iOS developers, thousands of new supplier and manufacturing partners, and a 400 percent increase in our employee teams,” the company said. A reporter and photographer visited the Austin campus this month and interviewed more than a dozen workers, from managers to a prep cook on the kitchen staff. Apple prides itself on providing top-notch phone service in 26 languages — 12 are spoken at the Texas call center — and the people who handle the calls are expected to follow up on any problem that cannot be quickly resolved. During the recent visit, Stephanie Dumareille, a senior adviser on iOS issues who is fluent in English and Spanish, patiently answered questions from a customer who was worried about saving her resume online and did not know whether she was using a Windows or a Mac computer. Brisa Carillo, who started out in the call center fresh out of college five years ago, now handles international payroll matters and is studying for her master’s in business administration so she can move up the ranks of the finance department. Flex assembles Apple’s Mac Pro desktop computers to meet the exact requirements of customers, who can choose among more than 4,000 combinations of features and hardware. Alan Marquis, a former Army officer who spent a couple of years streamlining processes on a manufacturer’s assembly line before joining Apple, now manages part of the complex software that integrates Apple’s suppliers into the company’s production systems.",

      "text": "picjumbo.com/Pexels\nThe iPhone 7 may be Apple’s first water-resistant phone, but don’t go dunking it in your pool’s deep end anytime soon — after all, the company cautions that it can only withstand up to a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That got us wondering, just what do manufacturers like Apple mean when they use terms like “water-proof” and “water-resistant”? What constitutes a “rugged” device? And at the end of the day, how many times can you drop your phone in the toilet before it stops functioning?\nMore: The best waterproof smartphone you can buy\nAs it turns out, there are often standards behind terms such as “rugged” and “water-resistant,” and they’re quite strict. So before you buy your next “durable” phone, you may want to understand how to interpret the ratings behind them.\nThe ratings behind a “rugged” product “Rugged” is just a word, a marketing term as meaningless as “summer-proof,” “whatever-proof,” “water resistant,” and “dust proof” — all make for nice bullet points on a gadget’s spec sheet, but aren’t all that descriptive. “Rugged” and “water-resistant” devices can short when they fall into water, shatter when they hit the concrete, and shut down if they lay in the hot sun for too long. But when a phone’s been certified , by contrast, that means a third-party organization has conducted tests to ensure it can survive conditions like hard falls, dusty environments, extreme heat and cold, certain forms of radiation, and deep pools of water.\nPhone, tablet, and PC manufacturers designate the ruggedness of a device with two flavors of standards: the Ingress Protection (IP) Rating, published by a standards body called the International Electrotechnical Commission, and the Military Specification or Military Standard (MIL-STD), which are developed by various arms of the U.S. Military and Department of Defense. When Apple advertises that the iPhone 7 as “water resistant,” what it really means is that it’s achieved some level of certification.\nIngress Protection Rating The Ingress Protection Rating of a device is determined by how well it performs in tests that expose it to dirt, dust, and water. Ratings range from 1 to 6 for dust and dirt, and 1 to 8 for water, where the first and second digit in the rating indicate how well it withstands exposure to foreign particles and liquid, respectively. The maximum rating for solid objects, IP 6, means a device is completely resistant to dust and dirt. A water resistance rating of 8, meanwhile, means it can be submerged in liquid for an indefinite amount of time up to a depth specified by the manufacturer.\nIn order for a smartphone to achieve a rating, it must pass every test leading up to the highest rating achieved. For a smartphone to gain IP68 certification, for example, it must pass dust protection tests through 6 and water protection tests through level 8. Below is a breakdown of the ratings for solid foreign objects.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected No protection against solid objects 1 >50 millimeter Protection against large surfaces like the back of the hand 2 >12.5 millimeter Protection against finger-sized objects 3 >2.5 millimeter Protection against thick wires and like objects 4 >1 millimeter Protection against wires, screws, etc. 5 Dust protected Some protection against dust and complete protection against contact 6 Dust tight Complete protection against dust and contact And here’s a chart for water resistance ratings.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected 1 Dripping water Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water 2 Dripping water when tilted up to 15 degrees Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water when tilted 15 degrees from normal position 3 Spraying water Protection against 5 minutes of spraying water at any angle up to 60 degrees from the vertical 4 Splashing water Protection against 5 minutes of splashing water 5 Water jets Protected against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a 6.3-millimeter nozzel from any direction 6 Powerful water jets Protection against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a powerful nozzle (12.5-millimeter) from any direction 7 Immersion up to 1 meter Protection against 30 minutes of water up to 1 meter of submersion 8 Immersion beyond 1 meter Protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer For an idea of how an IP test is conducted, take a look at this video of a test being conducted on behalf of electronics company Siemens. The resulting rating looks something like this: IP67. That’s the certification the iPhone 7 has received, and it means that the phone’s both completely protected against solid objects and can withstand up to a meter of water for 30 minutes.\nIt isn’t always that simple, though. Some phones have two ratings, such as Sony’s IP55- and IP57-certified Xperia Z, which usually indicates that the device failed water or dust protection at a certain level. In the Xperia Z’s case, water protection level 6.\nMilitary Specifications and Standards Military Specifications and Standards number in the hundreds and certify a product’s ability to handle specific scenarios. For example, there are MIL-STD-810Gs that certify products to handle nuclear radiation exposure, drops onto concrete, rapid temperature changes, and a wide number of other environmental challenges.\nHere’s a partial list:\nTest Method 500.5 Low Pressure (Altitude) Test Method 501.5 High Temperature Test Method 502.5 Low Temperature Test Method 503.5 Temperature Shock Test Method 504.1 Contamination by Fluids Test Method 505.5 Solar Radiation (Sunshine) Test Method 506.5 Rain Test Method 507.5 Humidity Test Method 508.6 Fungus Test Method 509.5 Salt Fog Test Method 510.5 Sand and Dust Test Method 511.5 Explosive Atmosphere Test Method 512.5 Immersion Test Method 513.6 Acceleration Test Method 514.6 Vibration Test Method 515.6 Acoustic Noise Test Method 516.6 Shock Test Method 517.1 Pyroshock Test Method 518.1 Acidic Atmosphere Test Method 519.6 Gunfire Shock Test Method 520.3 Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, and Altitude Test Method 521.3 Icing/Freezing Rain Test Method 522.1 Ballistic Shock Test Method 523.3 Vibro-Acoustic/Temperature Test Method 524 Freeze / Thaw Test Method 525 Time Waveform Replication Test Method 526 Rail Impact. Test Method 526 Rail Impact Test Method 527 Multi-Exciter Test Method 528 Mechanical Vibrations of Shipboard Equipment (Type I – Environmental and Type II – Internally Excited) Perhaps the most common standard for rugged devices is MIL-STD-810G, which is an umbrella designation with a number of durability subcategories — namely protection against drops and falls.\nMore: What do military drop test certifications really mean? We asked the experts\nMilitary Standards ratings comprise an exhaustive number of certifications. Sadly, though, they aren’t exactly standardized. Manufacturers can conduct an array of different tests and arrive at the same certification. Take the 810G’s “temperature shock” certification, for instance, or a device’s ability to withstand fluctuating temperatures. The temperature range isn’t defined, and neither is the amount of time, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a smartphone maker to claim that its handset is 810G-certified without having to explain what, exactly, that really means.\nHow a real “Active” product should be built Panasonic, known for its durable line of ToughBook and ToughPad products, sees rugged products in an entirely different way than manufacturers like Casio and Apple. As opposed to focusing on an idea like “water resistance” or “dust proofing,” Panasonic’s Director of Product Management Kyp Walls says that shock protection is what makes its products more rugged than the rest.\n“What we say about all of our devices is that they will handle a drop,” Walls told Digital Trends.\nMore: If you’re a clutz who works at a construction site, the Cat S40 might be worth a look\nMany of the popular ToughBook and ToughPad products meet the MIL-STD-810G standard, which certifies the device against a lot of scenarios — including many that you’d likely find yourself in on a regular basis. “MIL-SPEC drop procedures say you will drop [the device] on every edge, corner, side, and face – equaling 26 drops on plywood, concrete and steel” said Walls.\nBut Panasonic isn’t just making rugged products for the sake of being rugged, Walls said. It’s releasing laptops aimed at specific audiences and scenarios. “We are trying to build devices for people who are in scenarios 95 percent of the time … Are there people who need a device who will take a 12 foot drop to concrete? Probably, but we’re building our devices for people who need a 4 to 6 foot drop. In order to design something to be submersible, you have to build it differently.”\nView photos\nthumbnailimage-scale-large More Digital Trends also spoke with Xplore, a manufacturer that focuses exclusively on designing and building rugged devices. It recently launched the RangerX , a rugged Android tablet. Like Panasonic, Xplore also tests its tablets, ensuring that they can survive the 26-point drop test on plywood, steel, and concrete.\nMore: Ten rugged cases to shield your pricey iPhone from dirt, dings, and drops\nXplore’s VP of Marketing Jim Plas gave us some details about why a rugged design matters, noting how “unlike the [Samsung’s] S4 Active, where they took an existing product and added features for water and dust resistance, we start from the core of the device with the mid-frame. Around that, you build the case and screen.” The mid-frame is important as it grounds all the components of the tablet or smartphone, and is what helps not only disperse shock from drops, but also helps resist water from the ground up. “The DNA of the device is rugged to begin with,” he added.\nPlas told us that, in his experience, “making a waterproof device with a user-replaceable battery is possible, but it sure isn’t easy.” He added that not only the battery has to be water-sealed, but also there couldn’t be any ingresses or ports from which water can easily enter.\nMore than IP67 For devices like the iPhone 7, certification goes as far as dust, dirt, and 1 meter of water. If you drop an iPhone 7 onto concrete from four feet up, you may very well kiss your gadget goodbye. Meanwhile, if you drop the RangerX, you’ll be fine, but it won’t fare too well in 1 meter of water. Rugged means a lot of things in the world of electronics, which is why it boils down the standards and ratings.\nPerhaps more importantly, just because a phone is has achieved a certain certification doesn’t mean it’ll hold up to abuse. Manufacturers conduct tests under lab conditions far different than the real-life scenarios you’re likely to find yourself in. In one particularly egregious example, Sony sent out marketing materials that showed the company’s IP68-certified Xperia phones being used underwater … accompanied by a warning not to use them in as depicted. “Remember not to use the device underwater,” the company said. “The IP rating of your device was achieved in laboratory conditions in standby mode, so you should not use the device underwater, such as taking pictures.”\nIt’s vital to find out exactly what ratings your device has before you buy it. Rare is the smartphone that truly does it all — if you see an ad claiming that a device is “rugged” and “water-proof,” you should find out the certifications behind those claims. No device is rugged in every way, so choose your protection based on the biggest dangers in your life.\nThe best waterproof smartphone you can buy How do you decide on a rugged case? Look at how each company tests them What do military drop test certifications really mean? We asked the experts",

      "text": "Apple jumped into the Black Friday deal frenzy Friday, teasing customers with gift cards on some items. If you're looking for deals on a new iPhone, Apple Watch, MacBook or iPad, however, you may score better bargains by skipping Apple's own stores.\nAt Apple stores: gift cards Similar to past years, Apple is throwing in Apple Store gift cards as its Black Friday promotion in what the company is referring to as its \"one-day shopping event.\"\nThose buying the Apple Watch Series 1 or Apple TV will get $25 gift cards. IPhone 6S, 6 and SE buyers will get $50 gift cards, and those purchasing an iPad Pro, Air 2 or Mini 4 tablet will receive $100 gift cards. There are no discounts on pricing and no deals for the company's latest products, the Apple Watch Series 2 and iPhone 7.\nApple is similarly not incentivizing purchases of its latest MacBook Pros with Touch Bar, instead only offering $150 gift cards for the older MacBook, MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Pro.\nUSA TODAY\n3 gifts not to buy this holiday\nThe Apple Store is, however, embracing some other Black Friday offers, matching other retailers in offering the Sonos Play 1 speaker for $149.95, a $50 savings. It is also throwing in three months of Apple Music (a $30 value) with the purchase of a Sonos Play 1 or Play 5 system.\nApple's deals are available in-store and online.\nTarget, Best Buy have Apple deals For those looking for the latest in Apple gear, your best bet is to look elsewhere. Target has the iPad Air 2 32GB for as low as $274.99, $125 cheaper than Apple's price. Target also is offering the Apple Watch Series 1 for as low as $198 for the 38mm version, $80 cheaper than at Apple.\nThe deals are even better if you have a Target card, which will save you an additional 5 percent.\nUSA TODAY\nSkip the lines—these are the BEST online Black Friday deals\nFor the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, a variety of carriers and retailers are offering promotions if you're willing to buy a monthly payment plan. Best Buy, Target, and Walmart are all throwing in $250 gift cards when purchased at their stores, while many carriers have deals in place to get an iPhone 7 for free.\nFacebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Black Friday shopping Fullscreen Post to Facebook Posted!

      "text": "Downloads \n88.4 k Cortana is Microsoft's answer to Google Now and Apple's Siri. Its launch coincides with the arrival of the Windows 10 operating system, where it comes built-in, although it becomes more portable and helpful with the use of its official Android app. With this assistant, you can send commands or questions with your voice or the virtual keyboard. It uses your browsing preferences, current location, and installed apps to respond. This way, you can ask questions that can be searched for online (through Bing, also owned by Microsoft), or have Cortana perform more difficult actions like saving reminders or editing your contacts. Using the geolocation system on your device, Cortana can suggest nearby attractions or the fastest way to get to a certain place. Thanks to Cortana's card system, you can see all sorts of information on the main menu, just like a homepage, including local news and weather. Notes \nThe current version of Cortana is in beta and only detects English expressions. Opinions about Cortana No opinions about Cortana . Be the first! Comment",

Subscribe Samsung Is Going To Include An Ai Assistant In Its Next Phone \nTaking a look back at another week of news from Cupertino, this week’s Apple Loop includes Apple’s problems with the iPhone 6 Plus and 6S, a magical power source for the iPhone 8, thoughts on the iPhone 7S, new problems with iOS 10, a new educational iPad, Apple dropping out of the router business, where Jony Ive is going next year, and the ultimate app for the MacBook Pro Touch Bar. \nApple Loop is here to remind you of a few of the very many discussions that have happened around Apple over the last seven days ( and you can read our weekly digest of Android news here on Forbes ). \nApple’s Problems With The Older iPhones \nThis week saw Apple quietly acknowledge a number of issues in older iPhones. First up was the iPhone 6 Plus’ ‘touch disease’ which third-party repair site iFixit (and others) believe is caused by the screen controller chips separating from the main logic board. Rather than a full replacement device, Apple will now offer a repair for $149 . \nIt should be noted that Apple is not acknowledging any flaw in the design of the iPhone 6 Plus, so this is not seen as an issue that would be covered under warranty. Neither is the iPhone 6 covered by this new repair procedure. Users who have already paid for a service on their 6 Plus can contact Apple for a reimbursement if they were charged more than the $149 charge now in place. \nMeanwhile the battery issue that has been causing a number of iPhone 6S handsets to shut down unexpectedly. If your handset is affected, Apple will replace the battery free of charge (assuming there are no other issues with the handset). Forbes Amit Chowdhury reports: \nApple has acknowledged that there are battery problems on some iPhone 6S models that cause the devices to shut down unexpectedly. Fortunately, the battery problem is not a safety hazard. The battery replacement program may have been in response to a request by the China Consumers Association (CCA) asking Apple to investigate complaints about permanent iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S shutdowns last week, according to AppleInsider. \n“Apple has determined that a very small number of iPhone 6s devices may unexpectedly shut down. This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” said Apple on a support page. “If you have experienced this issue, please visit an Apple Retail Store or an Apple Authorized Service Provider and have your device’s serial number checked to confirm eligibility for a battery replacement, free of charge.” \nWill The iPhone 8 Have Magical Wireless Charging? \nNext year’s iPhone 8 is expected to see a number of major new features and technologies. Two more ideas that may appear have been covered by Forbes’ Amit Chowdhury. He looks at two more potential features for the tenth-anniversary handset expected in September 2017, dual optical image stabilisation and remote wireless charging: \nApple is reportedly revamping the telephoto lens that is being used for the optical zoom emulation capabilities, which should be ready in time for the iPhone 8 release. And Apple supplier Largan Precision is expected to be the exclusive provider of 6P and telephoto lenses for the new iPhones. \n…The iPhone 8 is reportedly going to be chargeable from a distance of up to 15 feet from a plugged-in transmitter. Essentially the iPhone 8 would have a receiver built into the device to support the wireless charging feature. The benefit of the wireless charging feature is that you would not have to be tied to an outlet while using an iPhone 8 with a low battery. \nIf Apple can pull of wireless charging at a a distance of fifteen feet, it’s going to be very close to magical and I will be seriously impressed. That said, to have that ready in ten months time seems to be a very big ask. \nThe iPhone 7S Strategy Leaks \nThe jump up to the next cardinal digit in the presumptively titled iPhone 8 leaves a branding gap in the portfolio. KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo believes the iPhone 7S and 7S Plus will make an appearance during 2017, replacing the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus to allow Apple to sell a cheaper iPhone : \nApple pulled a similar redesign of the models further down the portfolio when it released the iPhone 5S. Rather than push the iPhone 5 down a rung on the ladder to become the cheaper model, Apple released the iPhone 5C. While it had a similar specification and design to the iPhone 5, it was marketed as a brand new machine with funky colours adorning the polycarbonate case. \nAlthough the supply of OLED screens for the iPhone 8 appears to be more robust than first expected, it’s unlikely to satisfy the demand if OLED was to move across the whole iPhone range in one fell swoop. The iPhone 8 is expected to be a pricey handset, pushing the $800 mark to buy SIM-free. Apple needs to maintain some presence in the lower priced markets. An updated LCD version of the iPhone 7 could be just what the portfolio requires iPhone 5C (image: Apple.com) \nLatest iOS Update Causing More Problems \nFollowing a quick update to iOS to fix Apple Health losing data, the latest version of iOS (v10.11) has highlighted two awkward errors in daily use. Some handsets are locking up at thirty percent battery power and the microphone in Apple’s own earpods may stop working during a call. Forbes’ Gordon Kelly : \nReported by the ever diligent users at Apple AAPL -0.49%’s official Support Communities forum, is a thread that is now 11 pages long detailing how iPhone users are finding their battery life suddenly gives out at around the 30% mark. \nWhile the exact percentage where the battery suddenly drops out varies, it is typically around the 30% mark. Interestingly several users also report they have experienced this since iOS 10.1 but iOS 10.1.1 did nothing to fix it and neither does the latest beta of iOS 10.2, which suggests that the bug is not currently on Apple’s radar.

      "text": "These Black Friday deals on Macs, iPads and Apple Watch are so much better than Apple’s sale Mike Wehner Pin it Share Apple’s own Black Friday sale is more like a neat little gift card offer, with no real discounts to be found.

      "text": "Apple’s Black Friday sale is awful, so here are all the best iPhone deals Mike Wehner Pin it Share Apple’s Black Friday sales aren’t exactly anything to get excited about; iPhones are still full price, but Apple will toss in a $50 gift card if you buy the year-old models. That’s more of a tiny bonus than a real sale, so in order to get the full Black Friday discount treatment, you’ll have to look elsewhere. Thankfully, there are plenty of retailers willing to swoop in and undercut Apple with zero hesitation. Here are the absolute cheapest iPhones you’ll find today: eBay: 256GB, unlocked – $799 ($49 off) Target : Free $250 gift card with purchase at regular price Walmart : Free $250 gift card with purchase at regular price (in-store only) Sprint : Free iPhone 7 – certain conditions apply T-Mobile : Free iPhone 7 – certain conditions apply Verizon : Free iPhone 7 – certain conditions apply Best Buy : iPhone 7 with installment billing agreement from AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon (up to $250 Best Buy gift card) Sam’s Club : $250 gift card and waived activation on any iPhone (iPhone 7 included) bought on installment plan – deal starts on November 12th iPhone 6 & 6s Target : iPhone 6s, $250 gift card with purchase at regular price Target : iPhone 6s Plus, $250 gift card with purchase at regular price Best Buy: iPhone 6s Plus (w/ 2-year contract), 32GB, Space Gray – $29.99 ($170 off) Best Buy: iPhone 6s Plus (w/ 2-year contract), 32GB, Rose Gold – $29.99 ($170 off) Other iPhones eBay: iPhone SE, 64GB, Unlocked – $429 ($69 off) Best Buy : iPhone SE starting at $9.99/month for 24 months from AT&T, Sprint, and Verizon (save $160) Walmart : $99 16GB iPhone 5s on Straight Talk Wireless (save $50) Check out our Black Friday 2016 hub for all the best bargains from every top retailer today and all weekend long.

      "text": "Practical Mac In my last Practical Mac column (Oct. 28), I bemoaned some of Apple’s choices in its just-announced MacBook Pro, such as limiting the maximum amount of RAM to 16 GB. \nSince then, we’ve learned that memory ceiling is related to maintaining acceptable battery life with the current Intel chipset powering the machine. The MacBook Pro models are also more expensive than similar tiers in the past.\nAnd I ordered one anyway. \nWhile I wait for it to arrive, I want to pass along a tip for dealing with a new annoyance — calendar-invitation spam — and look at what Apple’s apparent abandonment of its AirPort wireless router lineup means.\nMost Read Stories Live Apple Cup postgame updates: Washington 45, Washington State 17 | #6 Huskies dominate #23 Cougars, win Pac-12 North championship One of the oldest, biggest pines in the Pacific Northwest is dead Mariners acquire shortstop Jean Segura and two other players from Diamondbacks for Taijuan Walker and Ketel Marte Nooksack tribe boots out 300 members, faces showdown with feds  WATCH ‘Hawk House’ goes dark: Seahawks-themed Christmas light show too much for quiet Kirkland neighborhood  VIEW Cyber Sale! Save 90% on digital access. MacBook Pro to the future. Fanboy enthusiasm? No, I took a rational approach and listed pros and cons for my situation, which is something I recommend anyone do when considering a big purchase like this. It boiled down to a few key points (and I expanded upon them at my personal website ), which may help you if you’re in a similar situation.\nFirst, I’ve been purring along with a 2010 MacBook Pro, and although it’s still a good machine, it’s starting to get behind the technology curve. I’ve managed to eke out more life by swapping the original hard drive and optical drive for two solid-state drives, but it’s limited to FireWire 800 and USB 2 port speeds, doesn’t support Handoff for quick intercommunication among Apple devices and is starting to get pokey.\nSecond, I do all of my professional work on this machine. I considered going in a different direction and getting a 5K iMac as a main computer and an iPad Pro as a remote device, but I do too much work in disparate locations to be tied to a desktop. And although I adore the iPad Pro, it’s not a desktop replacement for much of what I need a computer to do.\nAnd third, I don’t mean to sound churlish, but I’m a Mac guy through and through. I sometimes need to run Windows, which I do in virtual memory using Parallels Desktop, but I don’t want that as my main operating system. I’m not knocking those who do — Windows just isn’t my everyday choice.\nSince I didn’t order the MacBook Pro immediately, mine won’t arrive until next week, so I don’t have hands-on time with one yet. But I am looking forward to a jump from 2010 to the 2016 model.\niCloud calendar spam . Just when you think you’ve got a handle on digital life, someone figures out a new way to try to scam you. The latest incarnation is calendar spam: an invitation to “attend” an “event,” which is actually just a nefarious link. \nIf you decline the event, the spammer still gets notified, which means your address is verified as being active. That, in turn, gets the address added to other lists and results in even more spam.\nHowever, there is a fix ( credit to Aaron Douglas , @astralbodies on Twitter).\n1. Sign in to your iCloud account in a web browser on a computer at icloud.com .\n2. Click Calendar to view your calendar.\n3. Click the Settings button (the gear icon at lower left) and choose Preferences.\n4. Click the Advanced tab.\n5. Under “Receive event invitations as,” choose the Email option.\nAfter you do that, all invitations arrive only as emails, which hopefully will be categorized as spam in your mail program. (I use SpamSieve to help cut down unwanted mail in Apple’s Mail app.)\nAirPort’s last flight. It looks as if Apple’s AirPort line of Wi-Fi routers isn’t flying into the future. According to a report by Mark Gurman at Bloomberg , Apple has reassigned its engineers working on AirPort products to other areas. \nI’ve recommended AirPort base stations nearly since the beginning of home Wi-Fi because they’re the easiest to set up and maintain. \nOne plausible explanation for Apple’s change is that wireless networking is shifting focus from a stand-alone base station to mesh networks made up of multiple devices. \nDo you have dead areas where the Wi-Fi is spotty in your house? Instead of one base station pumping out signal in all directions, a mesh network made up of two or more base stations covers far more territory. And they’re smarter about handling traffic and managing phones, tablets and all the other wireless products we now use.\nMy colleague Dave Hamilton at The Mac Observer presciently published a comparison review of three systems: eero, Orbi and AmpliFi. My house is still fine with a one-generation-back AirPort Extreme for now, but I know that a mesh option will be its replacement at some point in the future.\nJeff Carlson writes the Practical Mac column for Personal Technology and about technology in general for The Seattle Times and other publications.

      "text": "Doug Kass fills his blog on RealMoney every day with his up-to-the-minute reactions to what's happening in the market and his legendary ahead-of-the-crowd ideas. This week he blogged on:\nHow Apple remains a large short position for Kass. How the market is still resistant. Click here for information on RealMoney , where you can see all the blogs, including Doug Kass'--and reader comments--in real time.\n  Apple Remains Among My Largest Short Positions\n  Originally published Nov. 23 at 11:50 a.m. EDT   Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are continuing to underperform, recently failing to penetrate $115 resistance, which is the upper end of my projected risk range. While the company's current quarter will be fine -- aided by Samsung's problems and channel fill -- I don't believe the company will get away with bad execution, aggressive accounting, the absence of innovation and treating customers not so well, especially in the face of competitive products that are superior (Google Pixel Phone, Microsoft Surface Studio, etc.).\nPrev 0 of 4 Next",

Doug Kass Nov25,20169:57PMEST \nDoug Kass fills his blog on RealMoney every day with his up-to-the-minute reactions to what's happening in the market and his legendary ahead-of-the-crowd ideas. This week he blogged on: How Apple remains a large short position for Kass.

      "text": "Apple's Black Friday deals are officially live, and they're not very thrilling. You won't score any big discounts on an iPhone or Mac, but buying older Apple gadgets will get you up to $150 in Apple gift credit — perfect for buying presents or securing all of the dongles you need for your new MacBook Pro. GET MORE: The Best Black Friday Tech Deals, Updated Hourly\n\nIf you want the biggest free gift card possible, you can get a $150 Apple credit for buying almost any of the company's Mac computers. That includes the iMac and Mac Pro desktops, as well as the 12-inch MacBook, the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro. However, the deal doesn't seem to apply to the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models.\nApple Black Friday Deals Shop Now On Apple See full article here \nBuying an unlocked iPhone SE, iPhone 6s or iPhone 6s Plus will net you a $50 gift card — there's no deal for the new iPhone 7 , unfortunately. You'll get a $100 gift card for buying an iPad Pro, iPad Air 2 or iPad mini 4. Finally, buying either an Apple TV or various Apple Watch models will net you a $25 credit.\nOverall, Apple's Black Friday deals don't seem hugely compelling, particularly since they don't apply to some of the company's best and newest pieces of hardware. However, if you planned on buying an iPad, Apple TV or any other of the above gadgets anyway, that free gift card could prove invaluable during your holiday shopping.\nSee also : 15 Hottest Gadget Gifts of the Year Here's the Best Black Friday Phone Deals from Each Carrier How to Get the Best TV Deals on Black Friday Hottest Gadget Gifts of the Year",

      "text": "how rugged is your phone pexels photo More picjumbo.com/Pexels\nThe iPhone 7 may be Apple’s first water-resistant phone, but don’t go dunking it in your pool’s deep end anytime soon — after all, the company cautions that it can only withstand up to a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That got us wondering, just what do manufacturers like Apple mean when they use terms like “water-proof” and “water-resistant”? What constitutes a “rugged” device? And at the end of the day, how many times can you drop your phone in the toilet before it stops functioning?\nMore: The best waterproof smartphone you can buy\nAs it turns out, there are often standards behind terms such as “rugged” and “water-resistant,” and they’re quite strict. So before you buy your next “durable” phone, you may want to understand how to interpret the ratings behind them.\nThe ratings behind a “rugged” product “Rugged” is just a word, a marketing term as meaningless as “summer-proof,” “whatever-proof,” “water resistant,” and “dust proof” — all make for nice bullet points on a gadget’s spec sheet, but aren’t all that descriptive. “Rugged” and “water-resistant” devices can short when they fall into water, shatter when they hit the concrete, and shut down if they lay in the hot sun for too long. But when a phone’s been certified , by contrast, that means a third-party organization has conducted tests to ensure it can survive conditions like hard falls, dusty environments, extreme heat and cold, certain forms of radiation, and deep pools of water.\nPhone, tablet, and PC manufacturers designate the ruggedness of a device with two flavors of standards: the Ingress Protection (IP) Rating, published by a standards body called the International Electrotechnical Commission, and the Military Specification or Military Standard (MIL-STD), which are developed by various arms of the U.S. Military and Department of Defense. When Apple advertises that the iPhone 7 as “water resistant,” what it really means is that it’s achieved some level of certification.\nIngress Protection Rating The Ingress Protection Rating of a device is determined by how well it performs in tests that expose it to dirt, dust, and water. Ratings range from 1 to 6 for dust and dirt, and 1 to 8 for water, where the first and second digit in the rating indicate how well it withstands exposure to foreign particles and liquid, respectively. The maximum rating for solid objects, IP 6, means a device is completely resistant to dust and dirt. A water resistance rating of 8, meanwhile, means it can be submerged in liquid for an indefinite amount of time up to a depth specified by the manufacturer.\nIn order for a smartphone to achieve a rating, it must pass every test leading up to the highest rating achieved. For a smartphone to gain IP68 certification, for example, it must pass dust protection tests through 6 and water protection tests through level 8. Below is a breakdown of the ratings for solid foreign objects.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected No protection against solid objects 1 >50 millimeter Protection against large surfaces like the back of the hand 2 >12.5 millimeter Protection against finger-sized objects 3 >2.5 millimeter Protection against thick wires and like objects 4 >1 millimeter Protection against wires, screws, etc. 5 Dust protected Some protection against dust and complete protection against contact 6 Dust tight Complete protection against dust and contact And here’s a chart for water resistance ratings.\nLevel Object size protected against Effective against 0 Not protected 1 Dripping water Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water 2 Dripping water when tilted up to 15 degrees Protection against 10 minutes of dripping water when tilted 15 degrees from normal position 3 Spraying water Protection against 5 minutes of spraying water at any angle up to 60 degrees from the vertical 4 Splashing water Protection against 5 minutes of splashing water 5 Water jets Protected against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a 6.3-millimeter nozzel from any direction 6 Powerful water jets Protection against at least 3 minutes of water spraying from a powerful nozzle (12.5-millimeter) from any direction 7 Immersion up to 1 meter Protection against 30 minutes of water up to 1 meter of submersion 8 Immersion beyond 1 meter Protection against continuous immersion in water up to depth specified by the manufacturer For an idea of how an IP test is conducted, take a look at this video of a test being conducted on behalf of electronics company Siemens. The resulting rating looks something like this: IP67. That’s the certification the iPhone 7 has received, and it means that the phone’s both completely protected against solid objects and can withstand up to a meter of water for 30 minutes.\nIt isn’t always that simple, though. Some phones have two ratings, such as Sony’s IP55- and IP57-certified Xperia Z, which usually indicates that the device failed water or dust protection at a certain level. In the Xperia Z’s case, water protection level 6.\nMilitary Specifications and Standards Military Specifications and Standards number in the hundreds and certify a product’s ability to handle specific scenarios. For example, there are MIL-STD-810Gs that certify products to handle nuclear radiation exposure, drops onto concrete, rapid temperature changes, and a wide number of other environmental challenges.\nHere’s a partial list:\nTest Method 500.5 Low Pressure (Altitude) Test Method 501.5 High Temperature Test Method 502.5 Low Temperature Test Method 503.5 Temperature Shock Test Method 504.1 Contamination by Fluids Test Method 505.5 Solar Radiation (Sunshine) Test Method 506.5 Rain Test Method 507.5 Humidity Test Method 508.6 Fungus Test Method 509.5 Salt Fog Test Method 510.5 Sand and Dust Test Method 511.5 Explosive Atmosphere Test Method 512.5 Immersion Test Method 513.6 Acceleration Test Method 514.6 Vibration Test Method 515.6 Acoustic Noise Test Method 516.6 Shock Test Method 517.1 Pyroshock Test Method 518.1 Acidic Atmosphere Test Method 519.6 Gunfire Shock Test Method 520.3 Temperature, Humidity, Vibration, and Altitude Test Method 521.3 Icing/Freezing Rain Test Method 522.1 Ballistic Shock Test Method 523.3 Vibro-Acoustic/Temperature Test Method 524 Freeze / Thaw Test Method 525 Time Waveform Replication Test Method 526 Rail Impact. Test Method 526 Rail Impact Test Method 527 Multi-Exciter Test Method 528 Mechanical Vibrations of Shipboard Equipment (Type I – Environmental and Type II – Internally Excited) Perhaps the most common standard for rugged devices is MIL-STD-810G, which is an umbrella designation with a number of durability subcategories — namely protection against drops and falls.\nMore: What do military drop test certifications really mean? We asked the experts\nRead More Military Standards ratings comprise an exhaustive number of certifications. Sadly, though, they aren’t exactly standardized. Manufacturers can conduct an array of different tests and arrive at the same certification. Take the 810G’s “temperature shock” certification, for instance, or a device’s ability to withstand fluctuating temperatures. The temperature range isn’t defined, and neither is the amount of time, leaving plenty of wiggle room for a smartphone maker to claim that its handset is 810G-certified without having to explain what, exactly, that really means.\nHow a real “Active” product should be built Panasonic, known for its durable line of ToughBook and ToughPad products, sees rugged products in an entirely different way than manufacturers like Casio and Apple. As opposed to focusing on an idea like “water resistance” or “dust proofing,” Panasonic’s Director of Product Management Kyp Walls says that shock protection is what makes its products more rugged than the rest.\n“What we say about all of our devices is that they will handle a drop,” Walls told Digital Trends.\nMore: If you’re a clutz who works at a construction site, the Cat S40 might be worth a look\nMany of the popular ToughBook and ToughPad products meet the MIL-STD-810G standard, which certifies the device against a lot of scenarios — including many that you’d likely find yourself in on a regular basis. “MIL-SPEC drop procedures say you will drop [the device] on every edge, corner, side, and face – equaling 26 drops on plywood, concrete and steel” said Walls.\nBut Panasonic isn’t just making rugged products for the sake of being rugged, Walls said. It’s releasing laptops aimed at specific audiences and scenarios. “We are trying to build devices for people who are in scenarios 95 percent of the time … Are there people who need a device who will take a 12 foot drop to concrete? Probably, but we’re building our devices for people who need a 4 to 6 foot drop. In order to design something to be submersible, you have to build it differently.”\nthumbnailimage-scale-large More Digital Trends also spoke with Xplore, a manufacturer that focuses exclusively on designing and building rugged devices. It recently launched the RangerX , a rugged Android tablet. Like Panasonic, Xplore also tests its tablets, ensuring that they can survive the 26-point drop test on plywood, steel, and concrete.\nMore: Ten rugged cases to shield your pricey iPhone from dirt, dings, and drops\nXplore’s VP of Marketing Jim Plas gave us some details about why a rugged design matters, noting how “unlike the [Samsung’s] S4 Active, where they took an existing product and added features for water and dust resistance, we start from the core of the device with the mid-frame. Around that, you build the case and screen.” The mid-frame is important as it grounds all the components of the tablet or smartphone, and is what helps not only disperse shock from drops, but also helps resist water from the ground up. “The DNA of the device is rugged to begin with,” he added.\nPlas told us that, in his experience, “making a waterproof device with a user-replaceable battery is possible, but it sure isn’t easy.” He added that not only the battery has to be water-sealed, but also there couldn’t be any ingresses or ports from which water can easily enter.\nMore than IP67 For devices like the iPhone 7, certification goes as far as dust, dirt, and 1 meter of water. If you drop an iPhone 7 onto concrete from four feet up, you may very well kiss your gadget goodbye. Meanwhile, if you drop the RangerX, you’ll be fine, but it won’t fare too well in 1 meter of water. Rugged means a lot of things in the world of electronics, which is why it boils down the standards and ratings.\nPerhaps more importantly, just because a phone is has achieved a certain certification doesn’t mean it’ll hold up to abuse. Manufacturers conduct tests under lab conditions far different than the real-life scenarios you’re likely to find yourself in. In one particularly egregious example, Sony sent out marketing materials that showed the company’s IP68-certified Xperia phones being used underwater … accompanied by a warning not to use them in as depicted. “Remember not to use the device underwater,” the company said. “The IP rating of your device was achieved in laboratory conditions in standby mode, so you should not use the device underwater, such as taking pictures.”\nIt’s vital to find out exactly what ratings your device has before you buy it. Rare is the smartphone that truly does it all — if you see an ad claiming that a device is “rugged” and “water-proof,” you should find out the certifications behind those claims. No device is rugged in every way, so choose your protection based on the biggest dangers in your life.\nThe best waterproof smartphone you can buy How do you decide on a rugged case?

Reuters/Staff \nWhile Apple has claimed that it iOS 10 operating system is unbreakable, Pangu, the Chinese hacking group seems to be ready with the iOS 10 jailbreak. It has been reported that Pangu is adding more functionality to its iOS 10 jailbreak tool and timing the release of the tool. Apple is expected to release the iOS 10.0.2 update in December. Will Pangu release the update before that? \nEarlier, Pangu had claimed that it has already jailbroken the iOS operating system from Apple. However, to everyone’s surprise, Pangu went totally silent and never released the jailbreak tool. Experts believed the reason for this was Apple’s constant OS updates and new security features. \nNEUROGADGET reported that Pangu is adding more functionality to its iOS jailbreak tool, especially after the onslaught of the updates by Apple. An Alibaba Senior Security Engineer with the Twitter handle SparkZheng has claimed that there will be an iOS 10 jailbreak tool soon. However, he did not mention the date of the release. \nThe last iOS 10 update, 10.0.1 featured better iMessage functions via third-party apps, new emojis, new lock screen and a change in the 3D Touch. Online communities are eagerly waiting for the Pangu iOS 10 jailbreak tool so that they can evade device limitations and get root access to the newest iOS updates. \nFans believe Pangu will release its iOS 10 jailbreak tool during Christmas as it would be the perfect gift for the iOS online community. Apart from Pangu, numerous other hacking groups are trying to jailbreak the iOS 10 without any success so far. False claims have been made but nothing has shown up. \nFor the time being, Apple users have to wait with their fingers crossed and hope that the Apple iOS 10 jailbreak tool arrives this Christmas. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the jailbreak tool and Pangu.",

      "text": "Black Friday Deals: Apple gives gift cards as 1-day bonus By Mizgan Masani Nov 25, 2016 10:03 AM EST Apple is offering gift cards as part of One day shopping event on Black Friday Advertisement \nIts Black Friday deal day and Apple are in it by providing free gift cards with the purchase of a wide variety of company's hardware. \nIn Apple's parlance, they can call it \" One-day Shopping event .\" The company offers these cards at Best Buy. These deals could save up as much as US$149. Advertisement \nMany Apple products come with bonus gift cards, but exact models and card values were not clearly described in the mail out. But this year, you as a customer can score major deals on lots of Apple goodies, including iPhone 7, iPad Pro, Apple Watch and the new MacBook Pro. \nThings are absolutely the same in other areas as the company is offering nothing more than gift cards worth up to $150 dollars, if you happen to be in the United States. \nApple's entry into this year's Black Friday sales doesn't involve dropping prices on its iPhone, MacBook or Apple TV lines. \nThe retailer offers the 13.3-inch variant that doesn't have the Touch Bar with a cheeky $100 discount. T-Mobile customers can purchase a Samsung Galaxy S7 or Galaxy Note 5, and they will get the second one half off though Bill Credits. \nOther third party retailers, including Best Buy , eBay, and Amazon, have also rolled out their Black Friday 2016 Cheapest Apple Deals for the big shopping event. \nFor example, the 13-inch version of the MacBook Air that has 8 GB of RAM, 128 GB of internal storage and is powered by an Intel Core i5 processor will be available for $799.99. \nTo save you the trouble, here are the deals. \niMac , Mac Pro, MacBook, MacBook Pro (excluding late-2016 MacBook Pro models - the one that many people will want to buy) and MacBook Air, including configure-to-order versions of such products come with a $200 gift card. \nFor iPad buyers, the $140 card comes with the iPad Pro, while the Air 2 and mini 4 qualify buyers for a $70 card. \nIf you were planning to buy an iPhone 7 or 7 Plus, there's nothing here for you. But there's a $70 card with the 6s and 6s Plus, and a $35 card with the iPhone SE. \n",

      "text": "Who is Althouse? * View only LAW posts * Contribute * Use my Amazon Portal November 25, 2016 \"We all laughed when my sister said it was Apple’s way of welcoming Trump to 'their' village.\" Writes JSD in the comments to my post asking you what you did for Thanksgiving and referring to this Apple commercial that aired during football games yesterday: Watching the commercial with JSD's sister's idea in mind, I couldn't laugh, because you'd have to see the commercial first and then hear the punchline. With the order reversed, I had more of the experience of sweet poignancy that the ad's designers originally intended, but with a new deeper level. The monster is Trump. If the original intent of the ad had anything to do with using a monster because of Trump — who has been called a monster — it must have been with the idea that Trump would lose, and the alienated losers would need reintegration into Hillary Clinton's America. In that vision, the little girl who screws in the green light represents the young women of America who symbolize the future and show the monster the way to join the group. Stronger together. By the way, I saw a chalking on campus a few days ago. Should have photographed it, but I memorized it: \"Safe together/Strong together/Resist together.\" I'm not 100% sure that \"Strong\" was the right word or that the first 2 lines were in that order, but \"Resist together\" was definitely the punchline. I thought that was funny. After Hillary and her supporters lectured us for so long about how we needed to be together to be strong, she loses the election and oneness loses its luster. \"Resist together\" is the perfect oxymoron for the occasion.

      "text": "Learn More \nThe iPhone 7 may be Apple’s first water-resistant phone, but don’t go dunking it in your pool’s deep end anytime soon — after all, the company cautions that it can only withstand up to a meter of water for a maximum of 30 minutes. That got us wondering, just what do manufacturers like Apple mean when they use terms like “water-proof” and “water-resistant”? What constitutes a “rugged” device? And at the end of the day, how many times can you drop your phone in the toilet before it stops functioning? \nAs it turns out, there are often standards behind terms such as “rugged” and “water-resistant,” and they’re quite strict. So before you buy your next “durable” phone, you may want to understand how to interpret the ratings behind them. The ratings behind a “rugged” product \n“Rugged” is just a word, a marketing term as meaningless as “summer-proof,”“whatever-proof,”“water resistant,” and “dust proof”— all make for nice bullet points on a gadget’s spec sheet, but aren’t all that descriptive. “Rugged” and “water-resistant” devices can short when they fall into water, shatter when they hit the concrete, and shut down if they lay in the hot sun for too long. But when a phone’s been certified , by contrast, that means a third-party organization has conducted tests to ensure it can survive conditions like hard falls, dusty environments, extreme heat and cold, certain forms of radiation, and deep pools of water. \nPhone, tablet, and PC manufacturers designate the ruggedness of a device with two flavors of standards: the Ingress Protection (IP) Rating, published by a standards body called the International Electrotechnical Commission, and the Military Specification or Military Standard (MIL-STD), which are developed by various arms of the U.S. Military and Department of Defense. When Apple advertises that the iPhone 7 as “water resistant,” what it really means is that it’s achieved some level of certification. ",

      "text": "November 25, 2016 - Business - no comments By Levi SumagaysayTRIBUNE NEWS SERVICE Apple said Sunday that it will replace the batteries of iPhone 6s models that are unexpectedly shutting down. (Apple/TNS) \nOn the heels of finally acknowledging “touch disease,” Apple is addressing a different problem with its iPhones – and is offering a free fix. \nApple said recently that it will replace the batteries of iPhone 6s models that are unexpectedly shutting down. \n“This is not a safety issue and only affects devices within a limited serial number range that were manufactured between September and October 2015,” the company announced on its website. \nApple said owners of eligible phones can get their batteries replaced at the company’s stores or at authorized service providers, but not at wireless providers. The company also said that iPhone owners who have already paid for replacement batteries may be entitled to a refund. \nRecently, the Cupertino, Calif., company said it would repair iPhones that have “touch disease,” which causes flickering or unresponsive screens and is reportedly widespread. Apple said the problem – which it’s being sued over – likely stemmed from phones being dropped repeatedly. It said it would repair affected phones for $149. Share this:",

Click here for information on RealMoney , where you can see all the blogs, including Doug Kass'--and reader comments--in real time.\n Apple Remains Among My Largest Short Positions\n Originally published Nov. 23 at 11:50 a.m. EDT Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) are continuing to underperform, recently failing to penetrate $115 resistance, which is the upper end of my projected risk range. While the company's current quarter will be fine -- aided by Samsung's problems and channel fill -- I don't believe the company will get away with bad execution, aggressive accounting, the absence of innovation and treating customers not so well, especially in the face of competitive products that are superior (Google Pixel Phone, Microsoft Surface Studio, etc.).",

      "text": "William Thomas, 16, was found dead at the family home in south Wales He had his new Apple iPhone in his pocket when his body was found His parents now want his phoned unlocked to find out why he killed himself \nBy Abe Hawken For Mailonline \nPublished: 13:12 EST, 25 November 2016 | Updated: 23:40 EST, 25 November 2016 \nWilliam Thomas, 16, (pictured) was a brilliant young rugby player, a good sprinter and all round sportsman, his inquest heard \nA grieving couple today pleaded with a coroner to unlock their tragic son's Apple iPhone to try and find out why he hanged himself. \nSchoolboy William Thomas, 16, was discovered hanged with his new smartphone in his pocket in Llangyndeyrn, Carmarthenshire, south Wales. \nHis heartbroken parents asked police to check their son's phone calls and text messages but they were unable to access the phone without his pin code. \nAn inquest in Llanell heard Apple were approached but the mobile phone remains locked and its contents are still a mystery. \nHis father, David Thomas, told the hearing: 'If it was the phone of a suspected terrorist I'm sure they would get into it. We are clutching at straws to find out what happened.' \nWilliam was found dead at his family's farm in August, just two days before he was due to get his GCSE results. \nHe passed with three A-grades, four Bs and 1C and was due to return to school to study for his A-levels in September. \nHis parents David and Kelly said there was no reason why their popular and high-achieving son would want to end his own life but the phone could contain important information. \nCoroner's officer Malcolm Thomson told the inquest: 'William's phone was submitted for examination by Dyfed Powys Police who were unable to access it. \n'It was then sent away to a specialist company who went through every means possible but could not unlock it.' \nWilliam's parents told the hearing they had also seen a communication from Apple saying the phone could not be accessed. \nThe couple asked Carmarthenshire Coroner Mark Layton to adjourn the inquest for the phone to be examined and its contents revealed. \nMr Layton told them: 'I believe it's possible to get information off that phone and I will do everything in my power to get that information. \n'It may answer some of your questions, it may not. But at least we can try.' \nMr Layton said the police would send the phone away again to experts but he could force Apple to come to court to give evidence if necessary. \nThe teenager was found hanged with his new Apple iPhone (stock photo) in his pocket in Wales \nThe inquest heard the teenager was a brilliant young rugby player, a good sprinter and all round sportsman. \nHe had been selected to train with the Llanelli Scarlets and had played in a school's cup final at Cardiff's Millennium Stadium earlier this year. \nThe schoolboy was described as a 'perfectionist' with a well-developed sense of fair play and gave everything for his team. \nWilliam went to Ysgol Bro Myrddin in Carmarthen, where headteacher Dr Llinos Thomas said his death was the 'most heart-wrenching event' the school had faced. \nThe inquest heard on August 22 he went to a barn at the family's smallholding to feed a litter of newborn puppies but was later found dead by a friend. \nThe hearing was told Mr Thomas gave CPR until an ambulance arrived but his son was declared dead in hospital. \nThe cause of death was given as asphyxia due to hanging. \nCoroner Mr Layton adjourned the hearing until next year for the phone to be unlocked and its contents examined. \nHe told the court: 'It seems to me that if the family want to know what's on the phone, then they should.' \nFor confidential support call the Samaritans on 116123 or visit a local Samaritans branch, see www.samaritans.org for details.",

      "text": "11/26/16 AT 6:21 AM Close \nThe official Apple Black Friday sale turned out to be lackluster as the company did not offer any deals on newer devices such as the iPhone 7/7 Plus and gave a maximum $150 gift card free on the purchase of the MacBook Pro 2016 (without Touch Bar). So if you are looking for a Cyber Monday deal on an Apple device, it is better to look at third-party retailers instead. \nHere are some deals on Apple devices: \niPhone 7/ 7 Plus \nYou can get 15 percent off on both the devices at Target . Best Buy is offering a free gift card worth up to $250 with every iPhone 7 256GB and $100 gift card on 32/128GB Sprint, AT&T and Verizon versions of the device. New Sprint activations will get a $200 gift card. \nApple MacBook Pro 2016 13-inch (no Touch Bar) \nBest Buy is offering the device at $1,399 ($100 off). \nMacBook Air 2015 \nBest Buy is offering the MacBook Air (i5/8GB RAM/256GB) for $999 ($200 off). \nApple Watch Series 1 \nTarget is offering $72 off the Apple Watch Series 1, now available at $198. \nApple TV \nTarget is offering 25 percent discount on the Apple TV 2016 with Siri remote available at $112.49. \niPad Pro 9.7-inch \nTarget is offering discounts ranging from $150-250 on the iPad Pro 9.7-inch 32GB (available at $449), 128GB (available at $549) and 256GB (available at $649).

CST November 25, 2016 iCal scam (Photo: KARE 11) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST \nMINNEAPOLIS -- Scammers appear to have found a new way to target shoppers this holiday season, hitting many Apple users with phishing spam that shows up on their iCal calendars. \n\"A calendar item popped up on my phone and it was for $19.99 RayBans,\" said Ryan Plewacki, who received the spam invite on Black Friday. \nHe says it wasn't the spam itself or even the Chinese source that concerned him, it was the way the message reached him. \n\"You know everybody gets junk mail, everybody gets junk email, the occasional junk text, but my calendar was something that just… my wife is the only other person who has access to it,\" Plewacki said. \nComputer security expert Evan Francen, says receiving one of these messages does NOT mean anyone has accessed your calendar or other personal info, besides the email address linked to your calendar. \n\"At the end of the day, this is spam, just like every other spam email that you get,\" Francen said. \nBut the big difference with calendar invite spam is that hackers seem to have found a way around typical email filters, which also means responding to the invites in any way is a bad idea. \n\"If you choose accept or decline (the invite), the person who sent you the email is going to know that you did it,\" Francen said. \"So what you would expect, is if I did accept or decline, I would see an increase in future attacks, future spam.\" \nPlewacki says he simply deleted his invite. \nMany people took to social media asking Apple to address the situation on Friday. While the company hasn't released an official statement or remedy, support did reply to many users individually. \nSome tech blogs, such as 9to5Mac found a solution: create a new calendar and move the unwanted invitations to it, then delete that calendar.

      "title": "Bragi's 'The Headphone' takes on Apple's AirPods",
      "text": " Bragi's 'The Headphone' takes on Apple's AirPods Engadget 2 hrs ago James Trew © Provided by Engadget Almost three years ago, Bragi left an indelible mark on the headphone universe. The then-unknown company launched a pair of \"truly\" wireless headphones on Kickstarter that not only cut every wire, but boasted a slew of fitness-tracking features, all wrapped in a superslick design.\nBragi delivered on its promise , releasing the Dash this summer , but with a few compromises. The fitness features weren't comprehensive enough to be valuable, the microphone wasn't great, and even basic connectivity with phones wasn't very stable. You can't have bleeding edge without a few cuts though, right?\nEnter \" The Headphone .\" These $149 buds look a lot like the Dash, but are a much simpler proposition. The Headphone drops nearly all the smart features, and the result is arguably the product Bragi should have launched originally: a solid pair of truly wireless headphones. The Dash was definitely an impressive opening act, though, and perhaps necessary to earn the company the gravitas to be taken seriously.\nThe very first thing I noticed about The Headphone is that the build feels cheap compared to the Dash. The Headphone comes in a light plastic case -- not a cold, weighty metal one this time. There's no battery in that case either; it just serves as a charging cradle (and case, obviously). The Dash's smooth, touch-sensitive controls have been replaced by physical buttons on the right bud. There's also no app connectivity with The Headphone, and no onboard storage for music. So why bother? Well, there's at least three very good reasons: connectivity, battery life and price.\nBragi defined the truly wireless headphones category, and many competitors soon emerged. Remarkably, all of them -- almost without exception -- suffered some form of connectivity hiccup. This could be between the buds themselves, or between the headphones and your phone when outside (an issue with the Dash). Some cheaper products presented both problems.\n© AOL With The Headphone, connectivity issues have vanished. Even outside walking with your phone deep in your pocket. The Dash is very sensitive, and if you have your phone in the wrong pocket, music would suffer dropouts. With The Headphone I've had the odd minor glitch while turning my head to look for traffic crossing a road, with the phone in the opposite pocket.\nThe audio connectivity isn't just better than the Dash; it's better than any \"truly\" wireless buds I've tried (Erato's Apollo 7 and Earin , to name a few). Importantly, The Headphone's buds never lost connection with each other either -- a common problem with these products. Best of all, unlike similar headsets Bragi didn't use a design with something hanging out of your ears (looking at you, AirPods ) to help ensure good connectivity. Like the Dash, The Headphone sits flush in your ear, making them much more inconspicuous.\nOne downside to the physical buttons is that they require quite a push to register a click, so you're basically mashing the earbud into your ear each time, which can feel uncomfortable. This mashing effect happens with all three buttons on the right bud. It's a relatively minor annoyance, as you can always use your phone to control the volume, but it's something to get used to.\nThe lack of fitness features on The Headphone isn't a problem, as there are many other ways to track activity. But I did love the ability to load music onto the Dash, and leave my phone at home when going for a run. Not many truly wireless buds offer this, Samsung's Iconx is one of the others, but it's a feature that elevates the usefulness of wireless earbuds, especially when music streaming might not be convenient.\nA feature The Headphone does have is the \"transparency\" mode that Bragi helped pioneer. Transparency uses the microphone to blend ambient noise around you (traffic, people talking etc.) with your music. Handy when you don't want to stop your music, say when buying a coffee. But also a potential lifesaver for cyclists who gotta have their tunes on the ride to work.\n© AOL It's definitely a welcome addition to The Headphone's relatively basic feature set, but for some reason the ambient noise doesn't seem to be quite as audible as it is on the Dash in the same conditions. My doorbell pierces through much less on The Headphone while listening at moderate volume, and sometimes I had to remove a bud to engage in conversation which is less common with the Dash. Perhaps Bragi reconfigured it the second time around.\nMore importantly, music sounds pretty good on The Headphone, but caveat alert: Bragi's press materials told me that this might not be the audio profile that will be on retail units. The profile that is on this model I'm wearing right now is fairly neutral. That's to say, it's sounds like there's less emphasis on the bass and the high mid-range frequencies (vocals, melodies, etc.), which are commonly ramped up in consumer headphones.\nAgain, if we're comparing to the Dash, I actually prefer the Dash's audio profile. It feels a little thicker, more impactful (and a fair bit louder). The Headphone is still a very good listen, and probably more suitable to those who listen to live/acoustic music. My noisy brand of angry dance music just doesn't feel quite as thumping this time around, though.\nThe microphone, on the other hand, is less impressive. I rang a number of friends and family and didn't tell them I was using a hands free, and nearly everyone asked me where I was calling from in that \"you sounds different\" kinda way. I recorded a few tests on my MacBook using the mic on The Headphone and they ranged from poor to inaudible. You'll be able to use these to make calls, but it's not a strong suit.\nIt might seem like there's a lot of things lacking in The Headphone, and to a large degree that's true... if you compare it to the Dash. Pit The Headphone against most of the competition, and suddenly things look rosier. The general connectivity situation is a great step forward for the category. The audio quality is solid (even if the mic is lacking), and the six or so hours of battery life is pretty decent (though a shame there's no battery in the case).\nAt $149, the price undercuts Earin's lightweight buds by some $50, and a (no doubt deliberate) $10 less than Apple's AirPods, which is perhaps the competition Bragi's really setting its sights on. With a better battery life, decent audio and enough change to buy yourself lunch, The Headphone should appeal to those iPhone 7 owners shopping around for a wireless set. Especially if Bragi can deliver on it's \"November\" ship date, and beat Apple to market.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Reddit \nIn our latest installment of Apple Campus 2 flyovers, we see that Apple is nearing completion for its 2017 opening. The main structures are almost complete from the outside and trees and fountains and other landscaping are going in. Drone video and high definition stills are below… \nNote that solar panels line the roofs of almost all of the buildings and parking structures save for the carbon fiber events auditorium and the HVAC-lined R&D building. Apple hopes to make its Campus 2 building self-sustaining, at least during sunny days. It will have other energy producing apparatus on campus including Bloom Energy units . The plan is to use the grid as a backup and to sell excess electricity to the grid through its Apple Energy subsidiary . \nWe learned a month ago that Apple had pushed back its completion date to the second quarter of 2017 due mostly to landscaping work. That doesn’t mean full time employees won’t start moving in soon. \nApple’s previous construction schedule listed an expected end date for building construction and street utility work as the end of Q3 of this year. The updated schedule extends that three months until the start of 2017. It also notes the beginning and expected end date for landscaping and sitework, which Apple officially began in recent weeks and plans to complete by the second quarter of 2017, after its last known estimated move-in date.

      "text": "Apple Black Friday Deals Include iPhone, Apple TV, iPad, Watch Rebates Updated: November 25, 2016 — 1:33 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Janko Roettgers \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - Apple's long love-hate relationship with Black Friday continues with a bunch of deals that involve -- surprise -- full-priced items: Instead of reducing the sticker price, Apple decided to give consumers gift cards as rebates. \nThat's a bit disappointing, especially considering that you'd still have to pay taxes on the full price. Then again, it's better than last year, when Apple decided to skip Black Friday altogether. \nIn any case, here are some of the deals Apple listed on the Black Friday section of its website: \nRebates on iPhones: The iPhone 6s and iPhone 6S Plus ($549 / $649 and up unlocked) come with a $50 gift card. The iPhone SE ($399 and up unlocked) gets you a $25 gift card. Rebates on iPads: iPad Pro models ($599 and up) come with a $100 gift card. iPad Air and iPad mini purchases ($399 and up) will get you a $50 gift card. Apple TV rebate: Consumers who buy an Apple TV ($149 and up) get a $25 gift card. Apple Watch rebate: Apple is giving buyers of the Apple Watch 1 a $25 gift card. \nApple's site also lists rebate deals for select Macbooks and desktop computers. However, it's worth pointing out that the company isn't having any deals for its new flagship phone, the iPhone 7. \nIt's also worth noting that you may be able to get better deals on some of those products elsewhere. Target, for example, is selling select Apple Watch 1 models for $199 on Black Friday. For a more complete list of deals, also check out our Black Friday deals guide.

      "text": "10/20 Apple iPhone 7 Plus \nYeah, we're as tired of the iPhone as you are. It's overdue for a refresh in both hardware and software, and what Apple's passed as innovations end up feeling more like gimmicks. (When was the last time you \"force touched\" your screen?) All the same, and notwithstanding excellent releases from both Samsung (the Galaxy S7 Edge, not the exploding one) and Google (the Pixel XL is the best Android phone yet), the iPhone 7 Plus remains the best smartphone money can buy. That's largely because of its stellar camera, which, this year, got a second \"portrait\" lens that allows for 2x no-distortion zooming and software-enhanced depth-of-field effects that give you even more reasons to leave your DSLR at home—and still look like a pro. Add to that its perennially impressive battery life and an app ecosystem Android still can't match, and there's not much doubt about the best way to spend $900. Just keep a tight grip on that headphone dongle. \nCourtesy Apple ",

      "text": "With rumors of Apple leaving the Wi-Fi router game, attention is turning to next-generation alternatives. Namely, mesh networks that offer easier setup and better coverage than the single routers — and bridging them — of yore. But of the three leading contenders, eero , Ubiquiti's AmpliFi , or Netgear's Orbi , is best for you?\nDave Hamilton, writing for Mac Observer :\nI've tested three currently-available mesh offerings: eero, Netgear's Orbi and Ubiquiti's AmpliFi. While they all solve the same problem in basically the same way, they each have strengths and weaknesses. If you're finished reading and just want to buy, my TL;DR advice is that, at this very moment, I feel like eero is the best product to recommend to most users. That said, it's worth watching what Netgear does with Orbi over the next six months. If they keep adding features to it, Orbi could easily take the lead due to its tri-band Wi-Fi hardware. Still, even today Orbi or AmpliFi might be right for you, and I've listed more than a few points of comparison to help you make your choice. For those details… read on!\nI went in considering both AmpliFi and eero, now I'm leaning towards the latter. And though I have privacy concerns, others might want to consider Google's new Google Wifi system as well. Either way, if mesh is your next network step, give Dave's article a read and let me know which system you're getting.\n",

      "text": "Apple working with LG to bring 3D photography to iPhones   11:09 am \nEarlier this year, Apple unveiled its new and improved smartphone photography technology, but the next-generation iPhone might pack an even more impressive camera. \nThe Big A has purportedly teamed up with LG Innotek to develop a smartphone camera module specifically designed for 3D photography, The Korean Economic Daily reports. \nWhile there’s no clear timeline for its release, the publication speculates the new technology will power Apple’s next-generation lineup of products, starting with the new iPhone. \nThe news comes from sources “close to the situation” whose credentials remain undisclosed. Here’s what they had to say: \nApple is now studying how to apply its 3D camera technology into LG Innotek’s smartphone camera. Since LG Innotek also has its own 3D camera and related technologies, such joint efforts will likely to bear fruit sometime within next year. \nThe Cupertino titan has already used LG Innotek’s dual-cam solution in its larger iPhone 7 Plus model. In fact, it’s precisely this technology that Apple leveraged to offer its much touted ‘Portrait Mode.’ \nWhile details are scarce, Apple’s ambition to bring 3D photography capabilities to its next-generation lineup of smartphones could mean the manufacturer is contemplating implementing LG’s dual-cam tech in all of its phones. \nAmong other things, the next-gen iPhone camera is rumored to also support features in 2D and 3D for augmented reality gimmicks that will make it easier for people to interact with the physical world in new meaningful ways. \n–",

      "title": "Trump to Apple's Cook: 'Build a Big Plant' in the US",
      "text": "Trump to Apple's Cook: 'Build a Big Plant' in the US By PC Mag ME Team Nov. 26, 2016, 5 p.m. Trump urged Cook to 'build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States.' \nPresident-elect Trump this week spoke to Tim Cook on the phone, and asked the Apple CEO to bring more of its manufacturing back to the US. \n\"I said, 'Tim, you know one of the things that will be a real achievement for me is when I get Apple to build a big plant in the United States, or many big plants in the United States, where instead of going to China, and going to Vietnam, and going to the places that you go to, you're making your product right here,'\" Trump told journalists from the New York Times yesterday, according to a transcript of the conversation. \nTrump said he promised Cook and other tech companies incentives for manufacturing stateside, including \"a very large tax cut for corporations.\" \nAccording to Trump, Cook responded with \"I understand that.\" \nThe revelation comes after Nikkei last week reported that Apple in June asked Foxconn and another Taiwanese iPhone assembler Pegatron to look into what it would take to make iPhones in the states. \"Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns,\" according to Nikkei . \nIn 2011, Steve Jobs reportedly scoffed at the idea of bringing iPhone production to the US when asked by President Obama what it would take to make that happen. \"Those jobs aren't coming back,\" Jobs said at the time. \nIn 2012, Cook announced plans to bring some parts of Mac production to the US ; Apple reportedly invested more than $100 million as part of that effort. \nFor today's Random Access, we're demoing the Logitech Harmony Elite and sharing the latest news on Facebook censorship, lip-reading AI, and Apple. Ask questions! Posted by PCMag on Wednesday, November 23, 2016 \nTrump, meanwhile, made manufacturing a key part of his campaign, vowing to stop US corporations from shipping their jobs overseas. \"We're going to bring jobs back, big league. I've spoken to so many companies already, I say, don't plan on moving your company, 'cause you're not going to be able to move your company and sell us your product,\" Trump told the Times this week. \nOn the campaign trail, Trump called for a boycott of Apple over its encryption fight with the FBI. \"Tim Cook is looking to do a big number, probably to show how liberal he is. But Apple should give up, they should get the security or find other people,\" the president-elect said during a February rally in reference to Apple's refusal to create an iOS backdoor for the FBI. The agency eventually gained access to the iPhone in question on its own. \nIn a post-election memo to staff , Cook did not address manufacturing. Instead, he discussed concerns about Trump's rhetoric. \"Our company is open to all, and we celebrate the diversity of our team here in the United States and around the world — regardless of what they look like, where they come from, how they worship or who they love,\" he wrote. \nFor now, overseas production seems to be working well for Apple. Strategy Analytics this week reported that Apple captured a record 91 percent share of all smartphone profits worldwide during the third quarter. \"Apple's ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits,\" Linda Sui, Director at Strategy Analytics, said in a statement . Related Articles Trump Won't Destroy Silicon Valley \nHuawei, Vivo and Oppo were the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally during the quarter, but they were \"a long way behind Apple,\" Sui said. \nTrump, meanwhile, said he also got a \"great call\" from Bill Gates, who was in Washington, D.C. this week to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom , along with his wife Melinda Gates, from President Obama. \nFor more, see what PCMag's Evan Dashevsky and Juan Martinez have to say about Trump's call with Cook in today's episode of Random Access, embedded above.",

      "text": "The first behavioral intelligence-based smart collar for canines , nicknamed the \" Apple Watch for Dogs\" since it pairs with iPhones, was just released this week at Indiegogo .\nThe device, SensDog , was developed by a team that includes some of the world's leading dog experts. Its primary innovation is that it measures and recognizes specific dog moods and behaviors — sitting, eating, running, walking, etc. — as opposed to just notifying an owner of their pet's location.\nRELATED: Dogs Remember Even the Stupid Things We Do \n\nThe device periodically transmits information to the dog owner's iPhone , depending on the situation. \n\"This could mean information about the dog's stress, fear, injury or any extreme behavior, or positive things like needing to go out for a walk, or that it's time to eat,\" co-developer Ádám Miklósi, who is the head of the Department of Ethology at Eötvös Loránd University, told Seeker.\n\nHe explained that the device consists of a specially made Apple Watch encased in a small waterproof box worn around the dog's neck. The watch is outfitted with multiple body motion sensors that measure acceleration and speed of turning. This and other data is beamed to the SensDog lab, where it is processed by software that matches the movements to known dog behaviors and corresponding emotions.\n\nThe software also tracks the individual dog to determine behavioral patterns. These can then be compared to that of similar breeds over a period of days, weeks or months. \nMiklósi shared some specific examples on how owners in tests have used the device. In one instance, a dog digs up plants or chases other animals around the house when the owner is not home. SensDog notifies the owner, who then remotely communicates with the dog through the device to either scold it or calm him down. (Sounds and lights on SensDog can also be activated, depending on the model.)\nSensDog can additionally warn owners, he said, \"if the dog is afraid of another individual, such as a kid or dog, or if there is something stressful like a thunderstorm, fire or even an earthquake .\"\nSince the device captures data about all dogs wearing the high-tech collar, it initiates a worldwide, crowdsourced study on canines across the entire planet. Gathered information will be used to improve SensDog and to learn more about dog emotions, health issues and behaviors.\nImage: SensDog infographic. Credit: Ádám Miklósi, SensDog \nThere are a few potential problems to consider. While SensDog is water and shock proof, its battery life is 16–36 hours, depending on operation. As for all portable electronic gadgets, recharging is needed.\n\nRELATED: Wearable Computer Teaches Dog New Tricks \n\nCollars in general can lead to problems, such as constricting the animal's neck if too snug, or catching on things if too loose. It could also be a bit large for very small dogs, such as toy breeds. Some people with small wrists have had similar problems wearing the Apple Watch.\nOngoing exposure to radiation, a worry for humans, could now apply to dogs, especially since the device is worn so close to the canine's head. Miklósi, however, said that such potential health risks were addressed in the design, which is \"why we eliminated the GSM technology. Technically it uses Bluetooth and WiFi on the collar, but even this usage is limited with very low energetic impact.\"\nDogs are not the only animals that will soon be monitored via such sophisticated scaled-down tech. An even smaller version is in development for felines, SensCat.\n\"SensDog also works with wolves in captivity,\" Miklósi said, \"so we believe that there is immense potential to develop this system for different animal species.\"\nPhoto: Dog wearing SensDog, which works with iPhones and is the first behavioral intelligence-based smart collar. \nRelated Articles The best pet trackers: GPS and smart collars for dogs and cats › Lost Pet Tech: Comparing Cat and Dog Tracking Collars ›",

      "text": "A s tech companies in Silicon Valley strive to make their workforces more diverse, many of them have remained stagnant when it comes to progression. One of those companies is Apple.\nApple’s workforce is still predominately White and male, reports Recode .\nApple has made statements about advocating for diversity in the tech industry. “The most diverse group will produce the best product, I firmly believe that,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook . “ If you believe as we believe that diversity leads to better products, and we’re all about making products that enrich people’s lives, then you obviously put a ton of energy behind diversity the same way you would put a ton of energy behind anything else that is truly important .” \nBut the newly released figures prove otherwise.\nThe data, which was released by the company, shows that out of 107 high-level executives, only 20 are women. When it comes to racial diversity, the numbers are worse. There are only five executives who identify as Black, Latino or Native American and 14 executives who are Asian compared to 88 White executives. Over 65 percent of mid-level managers are White compared to only 11 percent who are from culturally diverse backgrounds. Apple is claiming that the figures can’t be used to illustrate its progress when it comes to diversity. The company says that the EEOC data isn’t reflective of how it assembles its workforce.\nDespite the stagnant numbers, Apple saw a rise in the number of minorities at the company, the report says.There was 27 percent of minorities and 37 percent of women who landed jobs with the company.\nAlthough the numbers of women and people of color are low within the company, Apple still remains one of the leading tech businesses when it comes to employing individuals from those groups.\nDuring an interview in 2015, Apples HR chief Denise Young Smith shared that the diversity issue would take time to change, reports CNET . She said the “diversity challenge … didn’t happen overnight so it’s not going to be changed overnight.” She also added, “The long-term aspect of it is what I hope people start to really internalize and understand.” \nSOURCE: Recode , CNET \nSEE ALSO: \nBlack Data Processors Seek To Increase The Number Of African-Americans In Tech \n4 Big Things Google Is Doing To Improve Diversity In Silicon Valley ",

      "text": "Apple ( AAPL ) might discontinue its low-cost iPhone SE handset next year in favor of a new entry-level iPhone, a top Apple analyst is speculating.\nIn a research note this week, KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said he expects that Apple's upcoming 11th-generation series of smartphones will come in three screen sizes. The flagship iPhone 8 handset will feature an organic light-emitting diode (OLED) display measuring 5.1 or 5.2 inches, he said. Apple also will sell two LCD-screen models that are the same sizes as the current iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, which have displays measuring 4.7 and 5.5 inches, respectively. Those new LCD handsets could be called the iPhone 7S and iPhone 7S Plus, he said.\nThe 4.7-inch iPhone 7S could become a new midrange or even low-end model for Apple, Kuo said, according to AppleInsider .\nApple's current low-end smartphone is its iPhone SE, which starts at $399. The next cheapest iPhone is the iPhone 6S, which starts at $549. Apple introduced the iPhone SE in March and is expected to skip its traditional annual hardware upgrade for the product.\nIBD'S TAKE: Apple stock has a below-average IBD Composite Rating of 43, meaning it has been outperformed by 57% of stocks in key metrics over the past 12 months. Apple stock has formed a flat base with a possible buy point of 118.79.\nThe iPhone SE is Apple's bid to attract more price-sensitive consumers, especially in emerging markets like China.\nThe iPhone 8 is expected to be a major redesign, featuring a bezel-free, edge-to-edge OLED display. OLED screens reduce power consumption and extend battery life. They also have faster refresh rates, better contrast, sharper color and a wider viewing angle. Plus, they can be used in curved and wraparound displays.\nThe iPhone 8 also might feature wireless charging or superfast charging, analysts say. It also will get a speedier processor and improved camera. The iPhone 8 is due out in fall 2017.\nApple and third-party retailers were offering Black Friday deals on iPhones, iPads and other Apple products for post-Thanksgiving sales.\nApple on Friday was offering free Apple gift cards worth up to $150 to shoppers who buy select Apple products at full price. But better deals for Apple products could be found at retailers like Best Buy ( BBY ) and Target ( TGT ).\nFor instance, Target was selling the Apple Watch Series 1 smartwatch for $198 on Black Friday, a $71 discount off its regular price of $269. Meanwhile, Apple was giving customers a $25 Apple gift card if they bought a full-price Apple Watch.\nApple wasn't discounting its iPhone 7 series phones for Black Friday. But Target was giving customers a $250 Target gift card if they bought and activated an iPhone 7 handset. And Best Buy was offering gift cards of $100 to $250 depending on the model of iPhone 7 purchased.\nDrexel Hamilton analyst Brian White on Friday reiterated his buy rating on Apple with a price target of 185. Apple stock rose 0.49% to 111.77 in the shortened session on the stock market today . Shares have been trading below their 50-day moving average all month, after hitting a nearly one-year high of 118.69 on Oct. 11.\n\"Apple remains one of the best-positioned tech companies to benefit from spending trends this holiday season with a well-received iPhone 7/7 Plus, a new Apple Watch and a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar,\" White said in a research report.",

      "text": "Flip \n2017 promises to be an exciting year for Apple, with several products in the pipeline. So without further ado, here is a rundown on the most exciting Apple devices that may see the light of day over the next 12 months. Image Credit: Veniamin Geskin / Twitter iPhone 8 \nThe iPhone range is always a highlight of any calendar year, but this should be particularly true in 2017 when the iPhone 8 emerges. This smartphone will mark the tenth anniversary of the Apple smartphone series, and thus the consumer electronics giant is expected to pack the device with some impressive specs and features. \nExpect a new design, improved screen resolution and camera functionality, along with some surprises. Image Source: YouTube iPad Air 3 \nThe iPad Air 3 is probably the most anticipated tablet to be released by Apple in 2017. Reports suggest that this will emerge in the first quarter of the calendar year, possibly in March. Early rumors relating to this template suggest that it will feature a new Apple Pencil, while a 4K resolution display has also been linked with the iPad Air 3. This could also come equipped with 3D Touch technology, making it more user-friendly. \n16 GB and 32 GB storage versions are anticipated, with the expected price tag of the iPad Air 3 in the $600 ballpark. There has been no official statement on the iPad Air 3 as of yet, but the existence of the tablet is considered to be a poorly kept secret. Photo by cchana Apple Watch Series 3 \nApple continues to work on establishing its Apple Watch as a mainstream device, and with this in mind the Apple Watch Series 3 may well arrive in 2017. This cannot be considered an absolute certainty, considering Apple only released the second version of it smartwatch just last year. But reports have already indicated   company is considering releasing the third iteration of the Apple Watch in September. \nThe Apple Watch 3 will retain popular features from the device released last year, such as the Global Positioning System, dual-core processor and water resistance. A range of new models, colous and the straps will also be made available, and it has been suggested that the FaceTime camera for video calls and selfies will finally emerge. Micro-LED panels will also ensure that the display is brighter than previous versions. Image Source: Apple.com AirPods \nIn some respects a relatively minor hardware release, nonetheless many Apple fans are still eagerly awaiting the emergence of AirPods . This earphone system will reportedly deliver convenience, outstanding quality and longer battery life when it is finally released, with the release date possibly in January of next year. \nOne of the interesting innovations also being linked with AirPods is the ability of the device to turn on and stay connected after a single tap. Another outstanding feature is the Apple W1 chip, which produces extremely efficient wireless for better connection and improved sound. \nThe Apple AirPods will retail at around $159. Image Credit: Apple Inc. iPad Pro 2 \nThe iPad Pro 2 will probably arrive in 2017, with a significant discount over previous models. Reports have suggested that Apple will provide three models at launch, with 9.7-inch and 10-inch versions accompanied by the largest 12.9-inch tablet. \nThere could also be a bezel-free version of the iPad Pro 2, as Apple is continually linked with producing such edge-to-edge displays. Leaked images also suggest that the tablet will feature 128GB of storage when released. \nExpected in March 2017, this will be the premium Apple tablet, and will follow on from the success of previous releases. Image source: Apple Mac Pro \nThe Apple Mac Pro has not been updated since it was originally announced at the Worldwide Developers Conference back in June 2013. While this will never be a mainstream device, this must nonetheless be somewhat concerning for Apple, considering the existing release is beginning to look rather dated for a state of the art computer. \nBut code located in the Mac OS X El Capitan OS suggests that a new version of the Mac Pro will arrive in the foreseeable future. This would be one of the more unexpected updates in the Apple product range, as some have suggested that the Mac Pro is commercially untenable. MacBook Air \nThe MacBook Air was updated in 2016, but considering the iconic nature of this Apple laptop, this update was rather tentative and disappointing. It is expected that Apple will once again upgrade the MacBook Air in 2017, with an improved Retina display, USB-C support, and the inclusion of Touch ID and Force Touch all anticipated. \nApple continues to dominate the laptop marketplace, with the MacBook considerably more recognizable and widely utilized than the Microsoft Surface pro, but it is in no position to rest on its laurels in this niche. \nApple Glasses \nRumors abound that Apple is working on a virtual or augmented reality device, with these suggestions dating back at least 12 months. There have been few explicit details about this device, and it could be that eventually Apple will release a conventional virtual reality headset. This would be logical considering the increasing the profile of VR following the release of the PlayStation VR system, to compete with the existing Oculus Rift. \nHowever, it has also been suggested that Apple has been working on an Apple Glasses system, similar to the Glass device released by Google previously. With the likes of Microsoft and Facebook also involved in virtual and augmented reality, it seems a certainty that Apple will get on board with this market in the near future. Image Credit: Automobile Italia/Flickr Apple Car \nFinally, there have been persistent rumors of the so-called Apple Car since February 2015 at least, with many believing   behemoth will eventually release an electric vehicle. While next year is far too early for this vehicle to emerge, it could be that Apple will finally let the cat out of the bag with regard to this project, whether deliberately or inadvertently.",

      "text": "\nThe aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is Apple's best smartwatch: It's not only a great fitness tracker and portable communicator, but improved battery life, a faster processor, and GPS may appeal to upgraders.\n\nSerenity Caldwell has been writing and talking about and tinkering with Apple products since she was old enough to double-click. Managing editor of iMore, she hosts a number of popular podcasts and speaks frequently at conferences. In past lives she worked at Macworld and Apple Retail.\n\nBest overall Aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 \nSee at Apple \nIf you're considering a smartwatch for your iPhone or want to upgrade from your \"Series 0\" original-generation Apple Watch, the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is the best version of Apple's smartwatch you can buy. It offers a great smartwatch experience with watchOS 3, stand-alone GPS tracking for outdoor workouts, \"swimproof\" water resistance for all but the most grueling underwater activities, a much brighter OLED display, 5GB of storage space for on-the-go music, and better-than-ever integration with the iPhone. It's available in silver, gold, or rose gold finishes, and an array of sport or woven nylon bands.\nBottom line: Whether you're looking to pick up your very first Apple Watch or considering an upgrade, the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is our best pick for you.\nOne more thing: The aluminum Apple Watch comes in two sizes, 38mm and 42mm.\nOne other thing: If you want to match your aluminum watch with steel-lugged watch bands, you can pick up custom lugs from Amazon .\nWhy the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is the best Speedy, swimproof, and stylish.\nThe Apple Watch has only been around for 18 months, but it's already spawned several lines and styles — so much so that it can be a little tricky to find the one that's right for you and your lifestyle. There are the casing styles: aluminum, steel, and ceramic; the custom band and watch face stylings in Hermès and Nike; the feature differences between Series 1 and 2; bundled band options; and, of course, watch sizing. You could choose any of these options and be well-suited, but I think the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is the best watch for most people buying their first smartwatch, as well as those upgrading from a Series 0 Apple Watch.\nOn the Series 2 side, the aluminum version is the least expensive entry point of the three models, but you're not losing many features by opting to spend $180 less. You won't get the $549/599 Apple Watch's superior sapphire screen or steel casing, but the Ion-X glass on the aluminum model should be enough protection for most people. (And, if you're really worried about the durability of your screen, you always spend $49 for AppleCare+, instead.) It also offers the most variety in color styling: The aluminum Series 2 comes in silver, space grey, gold, or rose gold, and you can swap out your band lugs if you'd prefer to use a band traditionally attached to a stainless steel Apple Watch.\nThough Apple's entry-level Series 1 aluminum watch includes the Series 2's processor improvements at $100 less, it's not our top pick primarily because it lacks the Series 2's larger battery, though first-time buyers and upgraders may also miss out on the lack of GPS, swim-proofing, a slightly louder speaker, and a larger array of starting band and casing combinations (Series 1 is limited to the aluminum 38mm and 42mm casings and Sport Band).\nAs the latest and greatest model, the Series 2 Apple Watch provides the best experience today without a huge dent in their pocketbook, and it should last at least as long — if not longer — than the Series 0's current 18+ month lifespan. It's also a great investment for current Series 0 Apple Watch owners who want a very noticeable bump in battery life and processor speed, or those who wanted built-in GPS on their smartwatch. During our review, we found the 38mm aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 far outlasting its Series 0 cousin, going a full day (and then some) after logging multiple workouts and GPS-dependent walks.\nIf you're trying to decide between the 38mm and 42mm, the bigger version features a bigger screen and larger battery, but it also comes at a $30 price increase and larger footprint on your wrist. After an informal Twitter survey asking followers their favorite aspects of each size , 38mm owners reported liking it for its \"subtle,\" \"light\" frame; it fits nicely on smaller-wristed folks — women and men alike — and \"doesn't feel bulky under dress shirts\" or jackets. 42mm owners who prefer the larger size praised it for its \"extra battery life,\" \"larger tap targets\" and \"legibility,\" and more \"proportional\" size for those with larger wrists.\nSeries 2 still won't last you a full day of exercise and sleep-tracking, but it's edging ever closer — and unless you're dead-set on holding out for Series 3 in 2017 or 2018, you'll find that the Series 2 Apple Watch has plenty of great features in the meantime to occupy your day-to-day life.\nBest on a budget Aluminum Apple Watch Series 1 \nSee at Apple \nThe Series 1 Apple Watch is the company's new-and-improved entry-level version of the original \"Series 0\" Apple Watch: It has the same external aluminum hardware, colors, and internal components as the Series 0, with one notable exception: The smartwatch's System-in-Package has been upgraded from the S1 to S1P. This newer system includes the same upgraded processor and GPU found in the Series 2 Apple Watch, though it lacks the GPS (hence why the S1P is its own unique chip aside from the S2).\nOn speed alone, it's a great option for first-time Apple Watch buyers who want to dip their toes into the smartwatch ecosystem, but that S1P chip also provides greatly optimized battery life in comparison to the Series 0. It's not quite as good as Series 2 (owing to the latter's bigger battery) but it's close — and those two features together make it a no-brainer purchase for the budget-conscious over trying to pick up a used Series 0 watch.\nThe Series 1 is limited in ways the Series 2 is not. For one, it's only offered in the aluminum finishes — silver, gold, rose gold, and space grey — and only with one combination of Sport band. And as I mentioned above, the battery life isn't quite as good as the Series 2; that alone is enough for me to recommend the latest model to any who can afford it or those considering upgrades. It also lacks the stronger ceramic back of the Series 2 Apple Watch, and strangely, isn't packaged with an adapter — only the charging cable.\nBottom line: If you're looking for a first step into the Apple Watch ecosystem or you want to spend as little as possible on upgrading until Series 3 arrives, the Series 1 is a great option.\nOne more thing: If you're thinking about saving money by going with the Series 1, make sure you consider future band purchases: If you plan on later buying a Woven Nylon model that a Series 2 watch ships with, that $100 savings between watch models can quickly turn into $50.\nFor fashion and durability Stainless Steel Apple Watch Series 2 \nSee at Apple \nThe stainless steel Apple Watch Series 2 is a more expensive entry along the spectrum of Apple Watch options, but it can be a worthy one if you want a watch with a slightly more classic look, or plan to upgrade to some of Apple's more expensive leather band options. As an extra perk, the stainless steel Apple Watch also comes with a sapphire screen, which provides extra resistance to cracks and scratches. It's the best option for those who plan to keep their Apple Watch for a few years, or those who like the look of stainless steel on a watch.\nBottom line: If you have the extra cash and want a upgrade in screen durability, greater band options, and a more long-term look, consider the Stainless Steel Apple Watch Series 2.\nOne more thing: Like the Jet Black iPhone 7 , the Stainless Steel model is subject to micro-abrasions as you wear it out and about. Like most jewelry, however, you can easily buff out most scratches .\nThe watches we didn't pick Nike, Hermes, and Edition \nThe Nike+ Apple Watch isn't officially out until October. While we'll certainly give it another look when it arrives, the only reason to consider this branded watch is for the company's exclusive perforated Sport bands, which won't be available on their own, or the two custom Nike+ watch faces. Otherwise, the watch is identical to Apple's other Series 2 aluminum casings.\nAs with the Nike+ watch, the Hermès line largely boasts custom watch faces and special bands as its perks; unlike Nike+, however, all the Hermès bands are available for stand-alone purchases, so you're really only missing out on the Hermès watch face (and custom brand name under-engraving).\nThe new \"Edition\" model of the Apple Watch is more financially feasible this year, starting at $1249, but the Ceramic Apple Watch is still out of the price range of all but the most fashion-forward Apple Watch owners.\nConclusion For most people, first time buyers and upgraders alike, the aluminum Apple Watch Series 2 is the best smartwatch out there for Apple's smartphones.

He called the company's marketing \"out of touch.\"\n\"They have manufacturing issues, they have issues in China, they got a stronger dollar that's going to hurt foreign sales,\" Ross Gerber, president and CEO of Gerber Kawasaki, an independent investment advisor, told CNBC's \"Closing Bell.\" \"We're very disappointed with management. It's just so disappointing to have nothing, absolutely nothing new.\"\nGerber said Google ( GOOGL ) and Microsoft ( MSFT ), who have led the way on smart home devices and virtual reality, are \"taking [Apple]'s lunch.\" But Munster said that Wall Street's view of the stock misses the forest for the trees. This month, Microsoft shares have risen 1 percent, while Google parent Alphabet has fallen 3.7 percent.\n\"At the end of the day, maybe the features weren't as exciting as they have been in the past,\" Munster said. \"The iPhone is a product that people want.\"\nDisclosure: Piper Jaffray makes a market in shares of Apple.\n© Provided by CNBC\nGo to MSN Home",

Despite this, the company is doing well in the smartphone market, according to the latest data from research firm Strategy Analytics.\n\nApple way ahead of rivals According to Strategy Analytics, in the third quarter, Apple’s profit share in the worldwide smartphone market was a record 91% or $8.5 billion of the overall $9 billion. Apple’s performance is surely impressive, as no other smartphone maker could generate profits of more than $200 million in the quarter, said Strategy Analytics.\nSamsung, Apple’s biggest rival, could not even find a place anywhere on the list. Chinese manufacturer Huawei acquired the second spot, while Vivo was third and OPPO took the fourth spot, claiming profit shares between 2.2% and 2.4% each. Apple’s profit was 40 times larger than its closest competitor.\nNeil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics, said, “Huawei captured 2 percent share of all smartphone profits, taking second spot overall, and becoming the world’s most profitable Android vendor for the first time ever.”\nPreviously, BMO Capital Markets analyst Tim Long estimated that Apple captured 103.6% of smartphone industry profits in the third quarter, the reason being that companies such as LG and HTC reported losses for their smartphone divisions. The reason for the discrepancy between the two datasets (Strategy Analytics and Long) is unclear.\nMaximizing pricing and minimizing production cost Linda Sui, director at Strategy Analytics, credits Apple’s skills in managing the relationship between pricing and production cost for continually strong profit maximization.\n“Apple’s ability to maximize pricing and minimize production cost is hugely impressive and the iPhone continues to generate monster profits. Huawei, Vivo and OPPO are the next three most profitable smartphone vendors globally this quarter, but they are still a long way behind Apple,” said Sui.\nOn a year-over-year basis, a decline in iPhone sales was seen in the second, third and fourth quarters of fiscal 2016. Only a marginal rise was seen in the first quarter, making Apple’s record-breaking profits even more impressive, notes MacRumors.\nFor its most recently completed quarter, Apple officially reported revenue of $46.9 billion on sales of 45.5 million iPhones. It also reported an operating profit of $9 billion. The company performed poorly in China, as a result of which its growth numbers went down significantly, but that was offset to a certain extent by the growth it made in 33 countries.\nOn Tuesday, Apple shares closed up 0.06% at $111.80. Year to date, the stock is up more than 6%, while in the last six months, it is up more than 17%.\nThe post Apple’s iPhone Captured A Record 91 Percent Of Smartphone Industry Profits appeared first on ValueWalk .\n",

      "text": "Blocked Unblock Follow Following IT guy, Apple geek, atheist, hobby guitarist, science junkie, perpetual math student, cricket fan, chess patzer, also trying to write stuff. Views are mine! 15 mins ago It’s been a weird year from a politics point of view. The Brexit vote was a disaster for the UK and the world in general in my opinion. That was followed up by Trump winning the USA Presidential election. Both results allegedly due to people feeling left out of the way the modern world is changing. So they voted for campaigns led by two groups of mostly rich white men who couldn’t be more removed from the people affected by globalisation. The blue collar jobs that have moved from the UK and USA to Asia are not coming back. They will be taken by machines. Irrespective of where they happen to be situated. It’s striking that many of the hangers-on and fellow travellers of the Brexit and Trump camps are anti science, anti women’s rights, evidence deniers, who promise the Earth then deliver little. They must be resisted. I’m an internationalist. The Brexit supporters may get the UK out of the EU, but they’ll never get the European ideals out of me. The values of the European project and the Enlightenment are worth fighting for and will triumph in the end. But we must do it by educating people for the 22nd century and the change that ubiquitous smart manufacturing and machine learning will bring in. People will need to do other jobs that the machine will do better. We should start by giving everyone a good basic income that they can live comfortably on. Then they can work on things that make them happy. Including looking after the planet and other people.",

      "text": "Your browser does not support the video tag. Apple \n\nThe Apple TV 4, which came out last fall, is one of the most advanced media streamers on the market. \nAs opposed to older Apple TV models, the latest version can install apps and is a fairly sophisticated computer that you can hook up to your flat screen television. \nYou can tell if you have the latest Apple TV by looking at the remote: the new version's remote has a touchpad and six buttons. The \"Siri\" remote even has a microphone, so you can ask Siri to queue up the next show. \nHowever, with all the new powers comes new complexity. There's also a brand-new touch-sensitive remote control to master. And it turns out, your Apple TV has a lot of hidden easter eggs buried in its new interface. \nHere are the best Apple TV tricks and shortcuts for power users: Want to rewind to catch what someone just said? The easiest way to do it is by tapping the corners of the remote's touch surface. Apple Siri can also perform a quick rewind so you don't miss important plot points. Simply ask it, \"what did he just say?\" Apple The remote that came in the box isn't the only remote that works with the Apple TV. You can add a universal infrared remote, like the one that controls your cable box. If you upgraded from an older Apple TV, those remotes work too. espensorvik / Flickr Creative Commons \nHere's how you do it. Go to Settings > Remotes and Devices. Choose Learn Remote. Follow the directions on screen to assign buttons on your old remote to control the Apple TV. If you'd like a more private viewing experience, you can pair wireless bluetooth headphones to your Apple TV. You can also add a Bluetooth speaker in case your TV's speakers aren't getting it done. Apple \nFor private listening , head to Settings > Remotes and Devices > Bluetooth. Pair your headphones or Bluetooth speaker as normal. Your Apple TV will go to sleep automatically, but if that's too long to wait, you can put your Apple TV to sleep immediately by holding down the Home button on the Apple TV remote and selecting Sleep from the screen. Apple Swipe down on the Apple TV remote while watching video to open up additional options, like subtitles, closed captioning, chapters, and speaker settings. Apple The new Apple TV remote can be a little bit jumpy. Luckily, it's easy to fix. Apple \nYou can find the setting in Settings > Remotes and Devices > Touch Surface Tracking. Apple TV has an easy way to switch between apps. Instead of backing up into the main menu, you can double-click the home button to open up the multitasking screen, just like on your iPhone. Apple Sometimes an Apple TV app will get stuck. (Netflix is buggy for me.) It's frustrating, but there's a way to fix it. Simply double tap the Home button to access the task switcher, then quit the app by swiping up on the trackpad. Apple It's unbelievably annoying to re-enter your password whenever you might want to buy a new app, especially since the current text input method is so clunky. Luckily, you can turn off password prompts. Apple \nYou'll find the switch under Settings > Accounts > iTunes and App Store > Password Settings. If you say a famous movie quote, Siri can pull up the movie it came from. Just try telling it \"may the force be with you,\" for example. Disney/Lucasfilm \nVia Reddit . There's an advanced settings menu hidden in the settings to your Apple TV. It's primarily geared towards Apple employees, with several technical settings, but anyone can access it. Apple \nTo peek at the Apple TV's advanced settings menu, travel to Settings > Software Updates. Once you're there, press the Play/Pause button four times. The hidden menu will reveal itself. Inside, you can set sleep settings, and load a VPN profile. It's also possible to boot up the screensaver without waiting for it turn on. Simply double-click the Menu button on the home screen. Apple Here's another hidden setting: demo mode, which sets up your Apple TV exactly how it would be found in an Apple Store. Fun! Apple \nFind it in Settings > General > About. Click the Play/Pause button four times. Restarting the Apple TV is easy. Hold down Menu and Home buttons at the same time. Apple The beloved free, open-source, play-everything video player VLC is available for Apple TV. If you've got a library of odd video files, try it out. It can handle MKV files, AVI files, and odd network streams. VLC \nMore info here . An excellent paid alternative to VLC is Beamer. Instead of installing it on the Apple TV, you install it on your Mac. Beamer automatically converts video into Apple TV-friendly formats on the fly, then plays them through Airplay to your Apple TV in high fidelity. Beamer",

      "text": "A s tech companies in Silicon Valley strive to make their workforces more diverse, many of them have remained stagnant when it comes to progression. One of those companies is Apple.\nApple’s workforce is still predominately White and male, reports Recode .\nApple has made statements about advocating for diversity in the tech industry. “The most diverse group will produce the best product, I firmly believe that,” said Apple CEO Tim Cook . “ If you believe as we believe that diversity leads to better products, and we’re all about making products that enrich people’s lives, then you obviously put a ton of energy behind diversity the same way you would put a ton of energy behind anything else that is truly important .” \nBut the newly released figures prove otherwise.\nThe data, which was released by the company, shows that out of 107 high-level executives, only 20 are women. When it comes to racial diversity, the numbers are worse. There are only five executives who identify as Black, Latino or Native American and 14 executives who are Asian compared to 88 White executives. Over 65 percent of mid-level managers are White compared to only 11 percent who are from culturally diverse backgrounds. Apple is claiming that the figures can’t be used to illustrate its progress when it comes to diversity. The company says that the EEOC data isn’t reflective of how it assembles its workforce.\nDespite the stagnant numbers, Apple saw a rise in the number of minorities at the company, the report says.There was 27 percent of minorities and 37 percent of women who landed jobs with the company.\nAlthough the numbers of women and people of color are low within the company, Apple still remains one of the leading tech businesses when it comes to employing individuals from those groups.\nDuring an interview in 2015, Apples HR chief Denise Young Smith shared that the diversity issue would take time to change, reports CNET . She said the “diversity challenge … didn’t happen overnight so it’s not going to be changed overnight.” She also added, “The long-term aspect of it is what I hope people start to really internalize and understand.” \nSOURCE: Recode , CNET \nSEE ALSO: \nBlack Data Processors Seek To Increase The Number Of African-Americans In Tech \n4 Big Things Google Is Doing To Improve Diversity In Silicon Valley ",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe iOS software on Apple’s iPhone and iPad devices comes with a variety of tricks for manipulating, editing and sharing photos and videos. With iOS 9.3 and later releases, the Photos app includes a “Duplicate” feature that lets you create extra copies of a still image or video with a few simple taps on the screen. This comes in handy, for example, if you want to keep an original photo and send an edited version to a friend. \n1. Start the Photos App by tapping the Photos icon in the iOS Home screen. \n2. Select the photo or video that you want to duplicate. You can do this from the Camera Roll or any of the other iOS photo albums. \n3. Tap the “Share” icon. When you tap it, the Photos app displays several options for sharing pictures. \n4. Tap the “Duplicate” button. \nThis step creates a duplicate file instantly. Regardless of where the original photo/video is in your Camera Roll, iOS puts the duplicate at the end. \nYou can duplicate several photos/videos by selecting them as above, then tapping the Duplicate button. \nNote : the Duplicate and Copy buttons serve two different purposes. Use “Copy” to copy a photo or video that you would then paste in a text message or other app; it does not create a duplicate file. \nEnjoy!",

      "title": "Review: Apple's 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar",
      "text": "Review: Apple's 13\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar By Saturday, November 26, 2016, 10:03 am PT (01:03 pm ET) Apple's new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar embraces the future, delivering it in a super light, portable, attractive and expensive package. But are users ready to embrace that future? And does the 13-inch model have enough horsepower and connectivity? Find out in AppleInsider's full review. At its base configuration, $1,799 the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar ships with an 2.9-gigahertz Intel dual-core Core i5 and integrated Iris 550 graphics. The processor options themselves are slightly faster than last year's MacBook Pros, but most users won't notice the difference, as the biggest enhancements come from other internal changes and an entirely new chassis. A welcome change is faster 2,133-megahertz RAM. The base configuration includes 8 gigabytes for the 13-inch model, though it can be doubled to 16 gigabytes. There is no 32-gigabyte option, on either the 13- or 15-inch models. Also new this year is a space gray option. The MacBook Pro can also be purchased in silver, but there are no gold or rose gold shades like with the 12-inch MacBook. The default configuration also includes 256 gigabytes of storage. For our review, AppleInsider tested a top-of-the-line configuration, featuring a 3.3-gigahertz Intel Core i7 processor with 16 gigabytes of RAM and a 512-gigabyte solid-state flash hard drive, carrying a suggested price of $2,499. Touch Bar We like it a lot —but for now, it's a work in progress. Arguably the biggest change for this year's update, the Touch Bar comes naturally and works exceptionally well for certain functions. After a few days of use, there are some applications we found invaluable, while others were superfluous. As with all new input methods, the Touch Bar will take some time to mature and find its best uses. Of note: Customization is key. Apple has made great efforts to give users the ability to tailor the Touch Bar as they need. It's great. We don't really use Siri in macOS Sierra, so we swapped out the dedicated Siri button. Of more value to me was a screenshot tool, which we added to the quick Control Strip on the far right side. Tapping that icon brings up the screenshot select tool, replacing the need to use the keyboard command Shift-Command-4. Because it's context sensitive, the Touch Bar then displays a series of options after the screenshot tool is tapped. Options displayed include Cancel, Selected Portion, Window, Entire Screen, and a Save To location chooser. This is just one, small example, but there are dozens of these across macOS Sierra. Another great one: Playing music in iTunes brings up a fourth, temporary link to Control Strip, and tapping it allows for more advanced music controls, including scrubbing and skipping tracks. All of this goes to show how the Touch Bar will mean different things to different people. We feel confident that most users will find utility in it. Another use that stood out to us was in Safari. By default, open tabs are displayed at the center of the Touch Bar, in the form of icons that show prominent graphics from each open tab. With the Touch Bar, switching between tabs is a breeze. Simply tap on the icon for each tab, or drag your finger across to quickly browse between open tabs. After a few days of using it and coming to rely on it, it makes going back to a non-Touch Bar Mac feel different and subpar. The usefulness of the Touch Bar is less apparent in other apps. We could see where some users who struggle with typing might appreciate the QuickType predictive suggestions, but for touch typists like us, this feature was completely worthless. There's even Touch Bar support integrated into Terminal, including a quick link to change the background color of the window. How necessary is this for a dedicated button? Not very, obviously. But it's not like it gets in the way of using the app. Touch ID It works, and it's fast. Logging in to your MacBook Pro with Touch ID when returning from sleep is quick and simple, just as you'd expect. The process is just as fast— if not faster —as it is on a newer iPhone. Apple Pay is here too, allowing you to securely enter credit card payment information on participating websites. At the moment, Apple Pay support on the web is somewhat limited, but support is growing— and we expect that to accelerate now that Touch ID is integrated into the Mac itself. Previously, users had to find their iPhone to authorize a purchase. There is one key way that Touch ID on the MacBook Pro is even better than on iOS: faster user switching. With a different person's fingerprint scanned, you can quickly and securely switch between active users on the MacBook Pro. It feels inevitable that multiple-account, multiple-fingerprint support will eventually make its way to iOS devices, particularly as they become more powerful and feature complete. But for now, Apple has only focused on multiple accounts on iPad for education use. We could really only find one downside to Touch ID on the MacBook Pro: Unfortunately, if you completely shut down your notebook, you must reenter your password to login. This shouldn't come as a surprise— it's a security decision, and it operates identically to Touch ID on iOS devices. But you should know that if you're the type of person who shuts down your computer on a daily basis, you'll still be required to enter your password every time you reboot, negating at least some of the convenience of Touch ID. Aside from this minor quibble, we're extremely pleased with Touch ID on the MacBook Pro and think it's a great addition to the Mac lineup. USB-C The switch to USB-C is a mixed bag. Yes, if you connect a number of devices to your MacBook Pro, you're going to need to buy dongles, adapters, hubs, or new cables. With USB-C (and Bluetooth) remaining in our lives for the foreseeable future, this seems like a one-time painful transition, thankfully eased slightly by Apple with discounts on compatible cables. We had a USB-C to Lightning cable handy that allowed us to plug in and charge our iPhone and iPad with ease. But Apple does not ship any of its devices with this cable (yet), and we imagine it will be an inconvenience for some users. It's also worth noting that Apple does not sell a USB-C connected Apple Watch magnetic charging cable (likely because the cable only supplies power, not data). If you're the type of person who likes to charge your Apple devices through your MacBook, you'll need a dock to re-energize your Apple Watch. The reversible USB-C ports also feature integrated support for Thunderbolt 3. Thunderbolt 3 has a lot of potential, but like the two previous generations of Thunderbolt before it, we're not holding our breath for a variety of speedy accessories just yet. Thunderbolt never quite caught on like we would have hoped, aside from some monitors and external hard drive arrays. With Thunderbolt 3, there's reason to be excited again, but it's going to take time for accessories to come to market. Hope for the best, but don't expect much in the near term. Though some professional-grade users have decried Apple's complete embrace of USB-C, we can't fault the company for its approach, and think it's better than leaving one foot in the present and one in the past. Yes, users who are tied to numerous legacy USB accessories, or who may be dongle averse, will want to sit out this generation and wait for the rest of the computing world to catch up. But we don't think most users will be that bothered by Apple's forward thinking. No more MagSafe Et tu, MacBook Pro? Perhaps the biggest advantage of switching to USB-C is the fact that any of the device's four ports can be used to power and recharge the notebook. We found this to be especially convenient depending on where you are using the notebook —there's no longer a need to wrap your power cable around to the other side (and risk an early fraying of the wire) to keep it charged. However, we must lament that the switch to USB-C for charging means the loss of MagSafe. MagSafe has long been a defining, stand-out feature for Apple's notebook lineup. We cannot count how many times our MacBooks have been saved from certain death when someone trips over the power cord. That quick-attachment, quick-release advantage is gone with the switch to USB-C. The cable plugs in snugly and securely, and if someone yanks on your power cord, your MacBook Pro is liable to go flying. For some, this may not be a big deal. For us, we view it as a step backwards. This change is not a surprise— Apple signaled it in 2015 with the launch of the ultraportable 12-inch MacBook. However, that notebook only has one USB-C port for syncing and charging, and thankfully the MacBook Pro has four. Keyboard It's different. Like the 12-inch MacBook before it, Apple has transitioned to an entirely new style of chiclet keyboard for the MacBook Pro. It's a full-size keyboard, complete with the same weird arrow keys. It feels different. After typing on it for a few minutes, you won't really notice a difference physically. It's responsive and it feels good. A more lasting change, however, still noticeable after adjusting to the MacBook Pro, is the loudness of the keyboard. That's right: It's noticeably louder than the previous-generation MacBook Pro. We suspect most people won't notice or care about this, or they'll adjust to it. And frankly the fact that the redesigned switch style doesn't bother us is the best thing we can say for the new, thinner keyboard. It's not a problem, but you should know that it is different. Retina display Gorgeous gets even prettier. The Retina display on Apple's late 2016 MacBook Pro with Touch Bar includes support for wide color. This means that a truer, more dynamic range of colors is visible on the panel. In a side by side comparison of the latest MacBook Pro with a 2015 model, the new display is noticeably brighter, and colors do pop a bit more. That said, Apple's past Retina displays have also been fantastic, so unless you're specifically doing a side-by-side comparison or have a need for wide color support, you're unlikely to notice. Perhaps even more impressively, the new MacBook Pro display is brighter with more accurate and vibrant colors while also being noticeably thinner than previous MacBook Pro panels. As a side effect of the panel being thinner, the Apple logo on the back of the MacBook Pro no longer illuminates. The bezel around the outside of the screen has also been reduced, reflecting a smaller footprint for the 13-inch model when compared to its predecessor. Design It's thinner, and better. That smaller footprint is felt in a number of areas, including a reduced weight down to just 3 pounds. With an all-aluminum chassis, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is also svelte at just 14.9-millimeters thick. It's an impressive achievement in design. Despite a reduction in size, Apple has managed to fit in a substantially larger multi-touch trackpad, allowing users more room to sweep across the display. The trackpad now features something of a \"widescreen\" ratio, matching the display above it. As with the 2015 MacBook Pro update, the 2016 13-inch model features the incredibly impressive Force Touch trackpad. Most users won't even notice that the trackpad itself does not click— using Apple's proprietary haptic feedback technology, it simply feels like a click when pressed. The speakers are also considerably louder, and are particularly good for a super thin and light 13-inch notebook. Prior to getting our hands on the new MacBook Pro, we were worried that the aesthetics of the speaker grilles on the sides of the keyboard might be a downgrade from the all-aluminum surface found on previous models. Fear not, as the speaker grilles are understated and attractive, and the sound itself is a big improvement. In a side-by-side comparison with last year's 13-inch model, the improvement was pronounced. Oh, also: Unlike the iPhone 7, the 2016 MacBook Pro still features a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack. Put down your pitchforks. Performance Do you need power, or portability? When it comes to choosing a MacBook Pro, for years the tradeoff has been in graphics. While the 15-inch model has a large enough frame to fit in its own discrete graphics card, the 13-inch model offers no such luxury. That hasn't changed this year. Over the years, Intel's integrated graphics have come a long way. But they still do not have the raw horsepower to compete with a dedicated GPU. For those who need the extra horsepower, the 13-inch MacBook Pro has never been and will never be a consideration. That remains the case, and this review is not for those users. As the sum of its parts, Apple's late-2016 13-inch MacBook Pro with Intel Iris 550 is more than capable enough to handle most daily tasks users can throw at it, including extensive multitasking with numerous tabs and apps open at once. Everyone's workflow is different, but if you're an occasional Photoshop or Final Cut Pro X user who isn't shooting Canon 5D 30.4MP photos or 4K Phantom footage, you'll likely have more than enough here to get you through the next three to four years of use. As for battery life, our tests showed the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar comparable to the last few generations of MacBook Pro models. We had no problem getting through a standard work day with brightness set to a lower setting and using Wi-Fi connectivity for tasks like browsing the web and checking email. Bringing more intensive tasks into the fold, such as editing video, would prevent 8-plus hours, however. Apple's own tech specs advertise up to 10 hours of uptime when browsing the web. To future-proof your machine, we would advise that most users opt for the 16-gigabyte RAM upgrade. Sticking with a 256-gigabyte SSD is not ideal, but since storage can be easily expanded with external drives, the RAM should be the first choice in upgrading for most users. As we noted in our 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review , some professional and prosumer users with needs for more RAM and processing power than Apple's latest notebooks can deliver are either going to wait for future Intel components to arrive, or they'll need to invest in a desktop machine. If you're in that camp, the 13-inch MacBook Pro is not a candidate for daily use. And it never was. Our MacBook Pro came with a dual core Intel Core i7-6567U CPU clocked at 3.3GHz, good enough for a single-core score of 4,321 and a multi-core score of 8,270 as measured through the Geekbench 4 benchmarking suite. For those who praise portability but need more ports and horsepower than the 12-inch MacBook, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar delivers. Though the Intel processor is not a significant improvement from a year ago, Apple's super-small chassis offers what remains the most powerful all-around notebook in its class. What about the model without Touch Bar? For some, the Touch Bar may come across as a gimmick. Those users can opt for the same chassis without a Touch Bar and save $300 in the process. That's not a small amount. The model sans Touch Bar can even be upgraded to a Core i7 processor and 16 gigabytes of RAM, though it has slightly slower Intel Iris 540 graphics and 1,866-megahertz RAM. The entry-level model also downsizes to just two Thunderbolt 3 ports, rather than four. To us, the question isn't so much whether the Touch Bar is worth the extra $300, but whether the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is worth a starting price of $1,799. If you've upgraded your Mac to a Retina display in the last two or three years, you should probably hold off. It's hard to recommend the 13-inch model with Touch Bar to you at $1,799, and anyone eyeing the $1,499 model without Touch Bar should consider waiting until they can afford the better model with faster RAM. We're thankful the model sans Touch Bar exists, and we believe it has a market it will attract. But that market should, and likely will, remain small. Conclusion The first MacBook Pro with Retina display debuted in October of 2012. Its starting price was $1,699— $100 cheaper than this latest-generation model with Touch Bar and USB-C. We can't help but feel that the new 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar would have felt like a better value at that same $1,699 starting price. Presumably Apple felt the same way, which is likely the main reason the $1,499 model without Touch Bar exists. While some professional users would have preferred that Apple put one foot in the future while keeping another firmly planted in the past, retaining full-size USB ports alongside new USB-C Thunderbolt 3 ports, Apple has embraced the future. And it's wise to do so. Now it's up to end users to decide if they, too, want to embrace the future. The future is pretty awesome. But it's also damn expensive.

As of press time, new orders for these new 13\" MacBook Pros with Touch Bar are backlogged by 4 to 5 weeks through Apple's direct and indirect sales channels, but Authorized resellers are making up for lost time with some deep discounts. Depending on the configuration, shoppers can save hundreds on their new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar by pre-ordering from an Apple authorized reseller who does not collect sales tax on orders shipped to most states. AppleInsider partner Adorama, for example, is offering AppleInsider readers the lowest prices anywhere on pre orders for the 13\" MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and 13\" MacBook Pros with Touch Bar bundled with 3 years of AppleCare extended protection when using the links below (or in our Price Guides) and then applying promo code APINSIDER at checkout. Because the Apple authorized reseller does not collect sales tax on orders shipped outside of NY and NJ, most shoppers will save between $325 and $415 in savings compared to paying full price with tax at Apple retail stores. To get the discounted prices, use the link below (or in our Apple Price Guides ), then during checkout, apply promo code APINSIDER in the Promo Code field right after your shipping info (where it says \"Do you have a gift card or promo code?\").

      "text": "SHARES show chapters 19 Hours Ago | 02:04 \nFollowing in the footsteps of its neighbor Apple , Snapchat queued up fans in New York City this week for the release of Spectacles. \nThe $129 funky sunglasses glasses allow users to take short, first-person videos and post them to Snapchat's ephemeral messaging platform. According to Snapchat parent company Snap, the glasses will be sold in a limited quantity. Case in point: They've been sold by vending machine in random locations across the country. \nThe millennial-friendly devices are in such high demand that they're being sold on eBay for as much as $5,000 . \nIf 18 hours of waiting in the cold doesn't seem like your kind of party, fear not — CNBC did the waiting for you. It turns out, while the glasses look goofy, they're worth it to up your Snapchat game and they stay on for those action shots.",

      "text": "Apple Pay will change the way your brain thinks about buying things Wired 7 mins ago Andrew P. Han © Apple Apple Drunk shoppers beware: Impulse buying online just got even easier. With Apple’s new MacBook Pro launched last month, all you have to do is tap your finger to the Touch ID scanner located on the Touch Bar to buy—no more searching through your wallet for the right card, no more typing in three-digit security codes and expiration dates.\nOn the front end, the new method is faster and probably more secure than using stored credit card info online. On the back end, it gives merchants and banks a new framework to process your purchases. And if past research is any indication, Apple Pay, Samsung Pay, Venmo, and countless other reduced-friction digital payment technologies are probably going to change the way your brain processes purchases, too.\nRELATED: Who Cares About the New iPhone Camera? The Real Change Is Apple Pay\n“You might assume from a rational point of view, there should be no difference in spending behavior based on how you’re paying for the item, using Touch ID versus a credit card,” says Sachin Banker, a consumer researcher at the University of Utah. But behavioral economists like him, who mix psychology and neuroscience methods with economics, know that the way you pay can make a big difference in what you buy and how much you’re willing to spend. And while there isn’t much data on digital transactions—less than a third of smartphone users in the US even make a phone-based payment each year —the way we use other payment systems can tell us a little about the future of digital spending behaviors.\nCash, for example, induces a psychological pain of payment, while credit cards are associated with rewards that go beyond airline miles and 2 percent cash back on groceries. Drazen Prelec , a neuroeconomist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Sloan School of Management, first came up with the idea of the pain of paying in 1998 . “There’s something schizophrenic about credit cards,” Prelec says. “On the one hand, people seem to feel better if they buy something with a credit card, but they feel much worse when they have to pay the bill. Credit cards really disconnect your mental accounting systems.” Debit cards, however, can reconnect the act of buying something with paying for it. “And that’s what people like,” he says.\nApple Pay can be hooked up to either a credit or a debit card, so consumers’ spending behaviors could be influenced by what method they use. But the impact of a digital payment technology goes beyond the account it’s linked to. Tom Noyes, a former Citibank and Wells Fargo executive and digital payments wonk, says that the implications of Touch ID are potentially radical: It’s not just a new way to pay, it’s changing what a transaction is. “Instead of presenting a payment, you’re presenting your identity,” he says.\nRELATED: Excruciating New Credit Cards Finally Give Apple Pay a Problem to Solve\nWhether it’s pressing a finger or tapping a smartphone, digital payment will bring a tangible dimension to the experience, too, and maybe even an emotional one. How it feels to use a device—one that feels far more individualized than a plastic card, that is linked to daily routines and your physical fingerprint—may influence how people feel about the payment technology on the device. MIT recently launched a program that turned Prelec’s campus ID into a free Boston public transit pass. “It’s changed my behavior, I use [public transportation] much more,” he says. “I think it’s not just the cost savings, it feels good to use the ID.”\nClearly, the banks in league with Apple think consumers will like paying with their devices so much that they’ll do more of it. If customers set their bank-issued credit cards as their Apple Pay default, using them more frequently and incurring more debt, so much the better for the banks.\nThese new transaction technologies are clever and convenient, but they could thumb the scales in favor of the banks. Prelec’s suggestion? Link them to a debit card. “In the end, [payment methods] are evaluated by how well they serve the user’s long-run financial objectives and how they make you better—or worse—off in a much broader sense,” he says. The drunk shopping? Well, that’s on you.\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Josh Edelson—AFP/Getty Images \"What brings you here today?\" \nApple is known for being one of the most challenging and exciting places to work, so it’s not surprising to learn that getting a job there is no easy task. \nLike Google and other big tech companies, Apple asks both technical questions based on your past work experience and some mind-boggling puzzles. \nWe combed through recent posts on Glassdoor to find some of the toughest interview questions candidates have been asked. \nSome require solving tricky math problems, while others are simple but vague enough to keep you on your toes. \n1. “Explain to an 8 year old what a modem/router is and its functions.”— At-Home Advisor candidate \n2. “Who is your best friend?”— Family Room Specialist candidate \n3. “If you have 2 eggs, and you want to figure out what’s the highest floor from which you can drop the egg without breaking it, how would you do it? What’s the optimal solution?”— Software Engineer candidate \n4. “Describe an interesting problem and how you solved it.”— Software Engineer candidate \n5. “How many children are born every day?”— Global Supply Manager candidate \n6. “You have a 100 coins laying flat on a table, each with a head side and a tail side. 10 of them are heads up, 90 are tails up. You can’t feel, see or in any other way find out which side is up. Split the coins into two piles such that there are the same number of heads in each pile.”— Software Engineer candidate \n7. “Describe yourself, what excites you?”— Software Engineer candidate \n8. “If we hired you, what do you want to work on?”— Senior Software Engineer candidate \n9. “There are three boxes, one contains only apples, one contains only oranges, and one contains both apples and oranges. The boxes have been incorrectly labeled such that no label identifies the actual contents of the box it labels. Opening just one box, and without looking in the box, you take out one piece of fruit. By looking at the fruit, how can you immediately label all of the boxes correctly?”— Software QA Engineer candidate \n10. “Scenario: You’re dealing with an angry customer who was waiting for help for the past 20 minutes and is causing a commotion. She claims that she’ll just walk over to Best Buy or the Microsoft Store to get the computer she wants. Resolve this issue.”— Specialist candidate \nBusiness Insider: 29 of the toughest interview questions you’ll have to answer to work at Facebook \n11. “How would you breakdown the cost of this pen?”— Global Supply Manager candidate \n12. “A man calls in and has an older computer that is essentially a brick. What do you do?”— Apple Care At-Home Consultant candidate \n13. “Are you smart?”— Build Engineer candidate \n14. “What are your failures, and how have you learned from them?”— Software Manager candidate \n15. “Have you ever disagreed with a manager’s decision, and how did you approach the disagreement? Give a specific example and explain how you rectified this disagreement, what the final outcome was, and how that individual would describe you today.”— Software Engineer candidate \n16. “You put a glass of water on a record turntable and begin slowly increasing the speed. What happens first — does the glass slide off, tip over, or does the water splash out?”— Mechanical Engineer candidate \n17. “Tell me something that you have done in your life which you are particularly proud of.”— Software Engineering Manager candidate \n18. “Why should we hire you?”— Senior Software Engineer candidate \n19. “Are you creative? What’s something creative that you can think of?”— Software Engineer candidate \n20. “Describe a humbling experience.”— Apple Retail Specialist candidate \n21. “What’s more important, fixing the customer’s problem or creating a good customer experience?”— Apple At Home Advisor candidate \n21. “Why did Apple change its name from Apple Computers Incorporated to Apple Inc.?”— Specialist candidate \n22. “You seem pretty positive, what types of things bring you down?”— Family Room Specialist candidate \n23. “Show me (role play) how you would show a customer you’re willing to help them by only using your voice.”— College At-Home Advisor candidate \n24. “What brings you here today?”— Software Engineer candidate \n25. “Given an iTunes type of app that pulls down lots of images that get stale over time, what strategy would you use to flush disused images over time?”— Software Engineer candidate \n26. “If you’re given a jar with a mix of fair and unfair coins, and you pull one out and flip it 3 times, and get the specific sequence heads heads tails, what are the chances that you pulled out a fair or an unfair coin?”— Lead Analyst candidate \n27. “What was your best day in the last 4 years? What was your worst?”— Engineering Project Manager candidate \n28. “When you walk in the Apple Store as a customer, what do you notice about the store/how do you feel when you first walk in?”— Specialist candidate \n29. “Why do you want to join Apple and what will you miss at your current work if Apple hired you?”— Software Engineer candidate \n30. “How would you test your favorite app?”— Software QA Engineer candidate \n31. “What would you want to do 5 years from now?”— Software Engineer candidate \n32. “How would you test a toaster?”— Software QA Engineer candidate ",

I have no idea why or how.\n\nThey also have Red (65.00) and Blue (55.00), way too much in my opinion. Good reviews. Amazon's price is 67.48.\n\nHas a 1 year warranty. \n",
