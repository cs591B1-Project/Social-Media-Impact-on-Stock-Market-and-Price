      "title": "Goldman Sachs Selects 84 New Partners",
      "text": " count=\"274\" data-total-count=\"274\">Every two years, Goldman Sachs promotes a fresh class of partners in a closely watched tradition that heralds back to the time when the company was still a private firm. This year’s list of the chosen is the longest since 2010 and includes the largest percentage of women. Goldman Sachs said Wednesday that it would add 84 partners, more than the 78 designated in 2014 but fewer than the 111 from six years ago. The current class has 19 women, 23 percent of the total, which surpasses previous years. Eighty-two percent of the new partners work in the areas that generate revenue like investment banking and asset management, and the rest come from what Goldman calls its federation, the behind-the-scenes functions like compliance and technology.\nThe ascent to the Goldman Sachs partnership is considered one of Wall Street’s highest honors, opening doors to an exclusive club of financiers. Most other companies promote their top employees to the level of managing director, a designation that also exists at Goldman Sachs. Partners are a notch above that, a mere 1.6 percent of Goldman employees, or roughly 500 people.\nAchieving that title is an incentive for Goldman workers to stay around rather than bolting for a rival. The class named on Wednesday reflects that staying power, with 75 percent of the new partners having started at Goldman Sachs as either analysts or associates.\nFamous partner alumni include two former Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and Robert E. Rubin. Goldman declined to give the exact number of partners it has, but it tends to keep fewer than 500 at any point. Many who leave move on to careers in government or elsewhere in business.\n The selection process, taking place over months, has changed little since Goldman Sachs was a private firm, according to Edith Cooper, a partner and the global chief of human capital management, who described it in a video on the company’s website. It evaluates individuals on things like how they are performing and what their potential for leadership is.\nOnce the names are chosen, Lloyd C. Blankfein , the bank’s chairman and chief executive, as well as Gary D. Cohn, the president and chief operating officer, approve the list and call all the new partners to inform them of their selection.\n“These appointments recognize some of the firm’s most senior professionals and acknowledge their commitment to our franchise, people, culture and values,” Mr. Blankfein said in a statement on Wednesday. “We congratulate all those selected and look forward to their continued strong performance, contributions and leadership in the months and years ahead.”\nThe partnership notifications come as Wall Street reconciles with another tough year for bonuses. Incentive-based compensation will decline 5 percent to 10 percent this year, according to estimates published in a report on Monday by Johnson Associates, a compensation consulting firm. That would represent the third consecutive year of declines, because of stricter regulation, a challenging trading environment and broken deals. That has also led to thousands of job cuts across the industry.\nOn receiving the promotion, partners typically get a salary increase and a slice of a special bonus pool. The promotions become effective on Jan. 1, 2017.\n“Everybody at Goldman Sachs is responsible for the firm’s performance and reputation,” Dane E. Holmes, the global head of investor relations for Goldman Sachs, said in a newsletter on Monday, previewing the partner announcements. “However, the level of accountability for our partners is fundamentally more different given the scope of their reach.”\nThe following individuals were promoted to be a Goldman Sachs partner on Wednesday:\nNicole Agnew\nAndrew Bagley\nJonathan Barry\nJonathan Bayliss\nDeborah Beckmann\nMichael Bruun\nRobert Camacho\nDavid Casner\nKenneth Castelino\nChristian Channell\nMassimiliano Ciardi\nDavid Coulson\nChris Crampton\nCanute Dalmasse\nMichael Daum\n Jennifer Davis\nDavid Fox\nAndrew Fry\nCharlie Gailliot\nGabriel Gelman\nJoshua Glassman\nCourt Golumbic\nParameswaran Gopikrishnan\nSarah Gray\nCarey Halio\nBrian Haufrect\nPeter Hermann\nAmanda Hindlian\nHarold Hope III\nErdit Hoxha\nKathleen Hughes\nRussell Hutchinson\nOmer Ismail\nGeraldine Keefe\nAndre Kelleners\nAasem Khalil\nSimon Kingsbury\nKathryn Koch\nTuan Lam\nDavid Lang\nBruce Larson\nGavin Leo-Rhynie\nTim Li\nPaget MacColl\nClifton Marriott\nElizabeth Martin\nJason Mathews\nAlexander Mayer\nBrendan McGovern\nSean McHugh\nCéline-Marie Méchain\nJung Min\nSam Morgan\nEdward Gary Morse\nHeather Mulahasani\nDimitrios Nikolakopoulos\nMichael Paese\nKim-Thu Posnett\nAlexander Potter\nMacario Prieto\nXiao Qin\nPadideh Raphael\nMarko Ratesic\nLawrence Restieri, Jr.\nJason Rowe\nDavid Rusoff\nMaheshwar Saireddy\nThierry Sancier\nJason Savarese\nJohn Sawtell\nStacy Selig\nTejas Shah\nNicholas Sims\nNishi Somaiya\nLi Hui Suo\nAurora Swithenbank\nChristopher Taendler\nRichard Taylor\nDavid Thomas\nAndrew Tilton\nPeter van der Goes, Jr.\nDamien Vanderwilt\nPeter Weidman\nNeil Wolitzer\nContinue reading the main story We’re interested in your feedback on this page.

      "text": "Not all the new Goldman Sachs partners have been bankers all their life.  en/264656/tenure-goldman-sachs-mds/ \nMost of the new Goldman Sachs partners announced yesterday have been with the bank for the majority of their career. Most have demonstrated the necessary loyalty to make the senior ranks and have never moved out of finance. There are, however, exceptions. Some of Goldman’s brand new partners have digressed and been busy with the sorts of activities unequivocally judged as making the world a better place . \nTake Jonathan Barry, a managing director in Goldman Sachs’ U.S. operation. He left Goldman Sachs in 2013 after nearly 13 years. He went on to become a partner at the Cancer Therapeutics Innovation Group (CTIG) in San Francisco. This firm sequences the DNA of cancer tumours to give doctors more insight into the specific mutations of an individual case and, therefore, more information on how to make the right treatment decisions. \nBarry left Goldman Sachs two years after being named a managing director in 2011. However, he spent just 10 months at CTIG before returning to the bank in March 2014. \nThen, there’s Parameswaran Gopikrishnan. Before joining Goldman he was a physicist at Boston University and spent some time researching random-matrix theory, which is used in finance to find hidden correlations in masses of data. Gopikrishnan studied its affects on the stock markets to filter out millions of ‘random’ seemingly similar movements in the stock market to find genuine patterns. \nIn 2011 Gopikrishnan’s research – which was conducted with Boston University professor H. Eugene Stanley – was used by MIT chemistry and chemical engineering professor Arup Chakraborty to identify patterns in mutations of the HIV virus . At the time, it was described as “promising”. \nMost other partners have spent their entire careers working in finance. However, not all of those bumped-up have been at Goldman Sachs for years. Peter Hermann, head of the European pension and insurance strategies group, joined from Royal Bank of Scotland in 2009 and was made managing director in 2012. Kathleen Hughes , global head of liquidity solutions sales at Goldman Sachs Asset Management, came from J.P. Morgan in 2010 and Dimitrios Nikolakopoulos, head of global equity structured products trading, joined as a managing director 2013. You don’t have to work at Goldman forever to make partner.",

      "text": "by Sarah Butcher 3 hours ago \nAs the world convulses and the 20 year bull-market in bonds shows signs of wearing thin, which type of employee is Goldman Sachs most partial to?  en/265645/the-genuinely-worst-front-office-job-in-banking/ And rel x \nAs the world convulses and the 20 year bull-market in bonds shows signs of wearing thin , which type of employee is Goldman Sachs most partial to? Is it the macro traders who help clients navigate the upheavals in the economic landscape? Not necessarily. Is it the technologists who will help automate the pitch books and the product control processes that sap human endeavour? Maybe not. \nIt’s the client relations people. \nDuring a presentation today at the Bank of America Merrill Lynch Future of Financials Conference, Goldman CFO Harvey Schwartz said being up close and personal with clients is key to Goldman’s competitive advantage in the post-Trump-election world. \n“The thing we bring to this kind of cycle is the commitment to the client,” said Schwartz. “The client connectivity feels super strong.” \nWhether this client connectivity will generate revenues is another issue. Long before he became CFO, Schwartz was a member of Goldman’s American financing group within its investment banking division. During this time, he said he encountered a banker who was executing a transaction. “I asked him how long he’d been working on that transaction and he said I had my first conversation about it seven years ago,” Schwartz recalled. \nIn this kind of uncertain market environment, Schwartz said Goldman’s advantage is all about its willingness to provide long term advice rather than pushing for a quick win. “Being close to the client, staying in touch with the boardroom is what differentiates us. Success is being the most valued advisor.” It’s not about doing deals or transacting all the time, said Schwartz: it’s about being the place clients turn to when they are making important decisions. \nSchwartz’s description of Goldman’s elongated time horizons is reminiscent of Lars Andersson, the Morgan Stanley M&A banker who reportedly spent ten years advising Monsanto for no money at all before being rewarded with a $120m fee. \nGoldman’s willingness to carry swathes of client-focused people who don’t necessarily make money on a daily, monthly, or even yearly basis, is good news for its M&A bankers, who might struggle to close deals in the electoral fug. While HSBC is busy monitoring exactly how its senior M&A bankers spend their time, Goldman’s message seems to be that its client-facing staff can go slow as long as they build relationships. In this model, days spent shooting or playing golf with clients are par for the course. \nOf course, it also means that the other parts of Goldman which are generating revenues in the short term will need to step up and pay for all those schmoozers. Fixed income traders are first in line. Schwartz said Goldman experienced a “big uptick” in trading activity after the election and Bank of America revealed today that it had the biggest ever day by volume after Trump’s victory. It’s too early to say whether this will endure, said Schwartz. \nLonger term, Goldman’s new retail bank (‘Marcus’) might be a lot more important. Also speaking at today’s presentation, Harit Talwar, the head of Marcus, says expects the business to generate returns in the “high teens” once it gets going. There’s no launch date as yet, however (Goldman doesn’t want to rush things, says Talwar) and in a vote, a majority of the audience thought Marcus will be too small to make much difference. \nSchwartz also said that Goldman still has no plans about its EU presence post Brexit and that any reports to the contrary are wrong. In other words, Goldman hasn’t definitively o pted for Frankfurt after all.",

Post to Facebook Here are Goldman Sachs' top trade ideas for 2017 Wondering how to invest in a year marked by Donald Trump's inauguration, China's growth and European populism?  //detne.ws/2g9fjEE   Join the Conversation   Here are Goldman Sachs' top trade ideas for 2017 Luke Kawa, Bloomberg 7:27 p.m. EST November 19, 2016 Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has got you covered, with a team led by Co-Head of Global Macro and Markets Francesco Garzarelli releasing its first set of top trade recommendations for 2017 in a note to clients. (Photo: Richard Drew / AP) \nWondering how to invest in a year marked by President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration, China's attempts to keep growth both high and sustainable, and the continued rise of populism in Europe? \nGoldman Sachs Group Inc. has got you covered, with a team led by Co-Head of Global Macro and Markets Francesco Garzarelli releasing its first set of top trade recommendations for 2017 in a note to clients. \nSome of these six trades are a continuation of existing high conviction calls from the bank; others are fresh ideas. \nA warning: the recent track record for Goldman's year-ahead trade ideas has been less than stellar. \nAmid the market turmoil that characterized the start of 2016, the bank was stopped out of five of its six recommended top trades before Valentine's Day. \n1. U.S. dollar the winner from developed market populism \nRemember the much-ballyhooed divergence trade that was among the most consensus calls of 2016? It's back but with a twist. \nThe rationale for this trade is now grounded in political considerations; chiefly, the populist tide sweeping the globe. \n\"In the U.S., events have moved in a U.S. dollar-positive direction, between the rising likelihood of fiscal stimulus, more protectionism and immigration controls, all of which add up to a more inflationary mix and tighter-than-otherwise monetary policy setting,\" the team writes. \"In Europe, ongoing uncertainty over the Brexit process will likely weigh on the pound, while the slew of elections, including the Italian political fallout after the constitutional referendum on Dec. 4and general elections in France, Germany and the Netherlands, will weigh on the euro.\" \nThe strategists are targeting 10 percent upside in the U.S. dollar relative to an equal-weighted basket of the euro and pound, and would exit the position if the trade went against them by 5 percent. This would entail the euro falling to parity against the greenback, and the pound sinking to 1.14 on a 12-month horizon. \nThe primary risks to the trade would be tapering from the European Central Bank and a delay in triggering Article 50 to begin the Brexit process. \n2. Bet on Trump getting more upset about China's currency \nGoldman sees Beijing's policy of managed depreciation versus the U.S. dollar continuing in 2017. \nThe strategists advise going long the 12-month non-deliverable forward contract, which calls for the U.S. dollar to hit 7.07 Chinese yuan, looking for it to move to 7.30. The team would cut the position if the contract fell to 6.75. \n\"The fundamental dilemma of China’s currency regime is that, in an environment of a rising dollar, keeping the CFETS basket stable requires $/CNY to move higher meaningfully, which carries the risk that capital outflows re-escalate,\" the team writes. \"Our base case is one where the $/CNY fix continues to grind higher, driven by domestic pressures and in the context of a stronger dollar.\" \nThe dollar has gained 7.5 percent against the yuan over the past year; the rate of appreciation required to hit 7.30 would actually imply a smaller move for the greenback over the next twelve months. \n3. Keep calm and carry the right EM currencies \nThe strategists recommend going long an equal-weighted basket of the Brazilian real, Russian ruble, Indian rupee, and South African rand against the South Korean won and Singapore dollar, two currencies often used as proxies by investors looking for another way to get short exposure to China. \n\"The expected return, including approximately 7 percent carry (on an annual basis) and 7 percent price return, is around 14 percent,\" writes Garzarelli. \nIn the aftermath of the U.S. election, some of these relatively higher-yielding currencies have been indiscriminately battered amid the selloff of emerging market assets, making it a good time to initiate long positions. \n\"The countries represented on the long side of our FX basket also have more limited exposure to U.S. trade/demand risks if the protectionist rhetoric from President-elect Trump is transformed into action,\" the strategists add. \n4. Long EM stocks with \"insulated exposure to growth\" \n\"Looking across the EM equity spectrum, we find that Brazil, Poland and India offer an insulated exposure' to the EM growth recovery story, without being particularly exposed to China growth or U.S. trade policy,\" the team writes. \nGoldman recommends buying an equal-weighted, currency unhedged basket composed of the Warsaw Stock Exchange Total Return Index, the Ibovespa Brasil Sao Paulo Stock Exchange Index, and the NSE Nifty 50 Index, looking for a gain of 20 percent and bowing out if the position falls 10 percent from current levels. \n5. The reflation trade has legs \nWhoops! This is the same position Goldman recommended at this time last year, which quickly fizzled out. \nStrategists are once again advising investors to go long 10-year U.S. break-even inflation (derived from the gap between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields). \nThe team expects the spread between nominal and inflation-protected Treasury yields to rise to 230 basis points, and would exit the position if it fell to 160 basis points. \nThis time, they're also recommending a version of the same trade for inflation in Europe, using swaps. \n\"We think there is scope for the 'reflation' trade to perform better in 2017 for a combination of factors,\" the team writes, citing firming energy prices, the end of austerity, and central banks' likely tolerance of above-target inflation. \n6. Long European dividend growth \nGoldman's final top trade recommendation for the year ahead: go long European dividend growth by way of the Euro Stoxx 50 2018 dividend futures in a currency-hedged position. \n\"Dividend swaps, as a hybrid between credit and equities, currently appear attractive in a cross-asset context,\" writes Garzarelli. \"We forecast a high 'carry' compared with other assets, which reflect both fundamental risks and supply/demand imbalances from structured products issuance.\" \nSince 2018 isn't too far away, the trade doesn't have a ton of duration risk, and visibility into dividend growth should come quickly according to the team, 70 to 80 percent of payouts in Europe are usually announced at the end of the first quarter. \n\"Shorter-dated dividends are less driven by changes in equity valuations and more closely linked to underlying earnings and cash flows,\" the strategists explain. \"Despite little earnings growth in 2016, EURO STOXX 50 2017 dividends delivered a return of 6 percent with a volatility of 7 percent year-to-date.\" \nThis index is currently trading at 112. Goldman is targeting a rise to 125, and would close the position if it fell to 105. \nTo contact the author of this story: Luke Kawa in New York at lkawa@bloomberg.net.

      "text": "Getty/Andrew Burton \nJPMorgan just announced a new line-up at the top of its markets execution team, and the team includes an interesting new hire from Goldman Sachs. \nThe bank has hired  Debra Herschmann from Goldman Sachs as head of corporate and investment bank user experience. She will also CIB chief information officer Lori Beer's management team. At Goldman, she was global head of user experience in client platforms. \nHer new role was announced to staff on Tuesday in a memo from  David Hudson, who was appointed to the role of head of markets execution  earlier in the year. The note set  out the make-up of his new team, and a mission statement for the unit.   \n\"In simple terms, Markets Execution will focus on providing clients with electronic distribution of markets products – in whatever way they choose – today and into the future,\" the note said. \n\"We will deliver this vision by leveraging leading-edge technology and design standards that will improve the user experience while lowering the cost of execution for our clients and for ourselves,\" the note added. \nHerschmann is a little different to your average Wall Streeter. She's taught university classes in computer animation and interaction design , and her interactive installations have been on display at the Boston Computer Museum and the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry. She also helped design probation management applications for the New York City Department of Corrections. \nIn her new role, she'll be responsible for making sure JPMorgan clients get a consistent, user-friendly experience on the bank's trading platforms. And her appointment hints at the changing nature of trading. \nJPMorgan corporate and investment bank CEO Daniel Pinto has spoken at length in the past about JPMorgan's efforts to prepare itself for changes to how the market operates. Trading is increasingly conducted over electronic platforms, and the fixed-income marketplace in particular is changing at a pace. Speaking at the bank's investor day in February, Pinto said:\n\"You cannot dictate how the clients, some of you, will decide to execute your transactions. What we can do is create all the avenues for you not to have a reason not to execute with us and going somewhere else. And this is what it's about.\"\nAs more and more trading is conducted electronically, things like \"user experience\" and \"design standards\" will become a bigger and bigger part of the business of Wall Street.\nHere are the other appointments announced in the memo:\nRichard James and Peter Ward will cohead markets execution for macro products, including futures and options and Neovest. Adam Shapiro will continue to head markets execution for spread products.  Daniel Ciment will continue to head equity electronic client solutions.  JPMorgan will soon name someone to \"drive  Markets Execution related product development for the Equity Derivatives business.\" John Roberts will continue to head electronic distribution of research.  NOW WATCH: Here's how much $100 is worth in every state \n",

      "text": "Goldman Sachs takes its best shot at outlining a possible future for US healthcare reform: \nOur best guess is a continuation of the tax credits and Medicaid grants, but in a different form. At this early stage, our expectation is that Congress will enact a new system that continues to provide for an expanded Medicaid program and tax credits to pay for insurance premiums, but with significant changes in the way those resources are allocated. In our view, the best guide to how Congress and the Trump Administration might reform the current system is in House Speaker Paul Ryan’s plan released in June 2016 . It would provide for: Tax credits for individual market health insurance. The plan would provide refundable, advanceable tax credits (essentially the same concept as a monthly payment from the government) to purchase health insurance on the private market. Unlike the current program, which is based on the average premium and adjusted based on income, the proposed credit would be adjusted only based on age. Repeal of the coverage mandates and partial repeal of insurance market reforms. The proposal would eliminate the mandates on employers to provide coverage and individuals to obtain it. It would loosen the rules regarding pre-existing conditions and premium variation, most importantly by specifying that premiums for the oldest enrollees can be no more than 5 times the premium for the youngest members (the current ratio is 3:1). This would encourage younger (i.e., healthier) enrollees to join. For older enrollees, House Republicans propose to use federal funds to subsidize “high risk pools” to cap premiums once they reach a certain level. Partial reversal of the Medicaid expansion. The House plan would offer states a choice between a “block grant” – a lump sum provided to states roughly equal to what they currently receive excluding the cost of the Medicaid expansion—or a per-capita payment that would roughly equal current spending per-enrollee spending but would grow more slowly than health costs. \nNot a bad guess. Also don’t expect any changes until 2019 at the earliest. And who knows how the prospect of big changes will affect insurer participation. I would also note that this might reduce spending vs. the current baseline, but certainly means higher spending than in the pre-Obamacare era. Interesting to see how Republicans handle that, assuming budget deficits and “small government” are still relevant issue within the party.",

      "text": "You have successfully emailed the post. The unofficial Goldman Sachs gift guide for 2016 Nov. 30, 2016, 12:00 PM 0 \nInstagram Instagram \nOnce again, it’s time for children everywhere to learn one of life’s most valuable lessons: Santa loves rich kids more. \nThis year’s gift ideas (our 4 th edition) are an unapologetic, eclectic mix of the practical and the fantastical – the things a man wants but feels guilty buying for himself, as well as the things he needs but probably doesn’t even know it. \nProvided that your pockets are deep enough, this is the only gift guide you’ll need. \nThis year, I have my eyes on a rare Bernard Buffet ($250,000), Ronald Reagan’s doodles ($2,000), signed self-portraits of The Beatles ($15,000), and Tupac Shakur’s passport ($TBD). Someone please buy that before Pharma Bro does. For his travels \nThe globetrotting gadabout needs this classic Tusting Waxed Canvas Weekend bag ($775), a universal MacBook charging station ($45) that includes 4 USB ports, a Kisha smart umbrella ($100) that tells you when it’s going to rain, and this Urban Carry G2 concealed, quick draw holster ($105). Handgun license sold separately. For his gym bag Birddogs \nFor the first time, I’ve decided to recycle a gift idea from last year’s list, mostly because I’ve never had so much positive feedback on any recommendation before. An investment banker / HBS alum poached Lululemon’s head of men’s design and started Birddogs ($55), the most comfortable shorts I’ve ever experienced. This will be the brand of 2017 – on every court, in every gym, and at every brunch table – so you might as well be ahead of the curve. Throw in this La Mer Skincare Set ($140), some sweat-resistant, wireless JLab Epic2 Earbuds ($99), and a Survival & Cross jump rope ($10). For his library Amazon \nBarnes & Noble blamed poor earnings on the election, but it’s time that we make reading great again. Book of the year for me is “ Diary of an Oxygen Thief ” ($9), an anonymously self-published dark satire that became a bestseller from word-of-mouth alone. Other notable picks include Liam Vaughan and Gavin Finch’s “ The Fix: How Bankers Lied, Cheated and Colluded to Rig the World's Most Important Number ” ($33), Richard Betts’ “ The Essential Scratch and Sniff Guide to Becoming a Wine Expert ” ($13), Bronwen Dickey’s “ Pit Bull: The Battle over an American Icon ” ($18), and the book that, to the chagrin of literary elite, will be a #1 bestseller, Tim Ferriss’s “ Tools of Titans ” ($17). For his closet Instagram \nMen hate receiving clothes as gifts; we hate the obligation of having to wear something we probably don’t like. But, there are some things that never occur to us to buy, like quality undershirts! Go with NVSBL ($27) - they’re longer (stay tucked), more comfortable, sweat and odor fighting, and totally invisible. Hygiene and aesthetics aside, they also significantly prolong the life of a dress shirt. And swim trunks! Because board shorts are simply not acceptable after college. These Thorsun Fan ($275) shorts provide an injection of American-made European elegance in the pool. Finally, a James Perse bathrobe ($395), because I’m still using the robe I stole from a hotel five years ago. For his competitive spirit Pickett \nRich people and poor people love the same things: cheese as a meal, taxidermy, getting married at home, day drinking, eating pigeons and rabbits, having too many kids, living in a hotel, taking financial handouts from the government, and of course, drinking games. Every man needs this Jaques Of London croquet set ($5,000), a Pickett lizard skin backgammon board ($2,485), and an Asprey lambskin Scrabble set ($11,950). If not, no sweat, the Hasbro sets ($14) from your local Walmart work just as well. For his dreams Down & Feather Co. \nWhy do people always talk about splurging on an expensive mattress and sheets, and then forget about the lowly pillow? Considering 30% of the average pillow’s weight is dead skin cells and dust mites, it’s time to for all of us upgrade with some Snuggle Soft goose down pillows ($500) or the more affordable, and highly-rated Miracle Bamboo Pillow ($53). For his midlife crisis \nI’ll put up with the “small hands” jokes to be behind the wheel of any of these classics hitting the auction block in December: A 1973 Porsche 911S Targa ($200,000), 1988 Ferrari 328 GTS ($180,000), 1971 Maserati Ghibli Coupé ($300,000), 1957 Mercedes-Benz 300SL Roadster ($1,400,000), or the more affordable modern classic, the 2011 Mercedes-Benz SLS ($140,000). For his kitchen Sertodo Copper \nNext to fly fishing and golf, cooking is the best therapy I know, provided that drinking is involved and that I don’t have to clean up after. Here are a few things most men would appreciate, but not otherwise think of: slick Cutipol Goa cutlery ($1,600) or a Sertodo hammered copper ice bucket ($255). And while there’s a waiting list for Bob Kramer’s forged meteorite knives, the Kramer 10” Damascus Chef’s knife ($450) paired with a John Boos butcher’s block cutting board ($464) is almost as nice. For his conscience Linley \nOrder some Berry Bros. & Rudd Bordeaux blend ($510). Proceeds from each case will support five children in the Room to Read literacy program for an entire year. And since it is Christmas, you might as well add an Asprey crystal wine decanter ($1,600) or the David Linley Girih spirit decanter ($810). For his inner child Amazon \nDonald Trump won. Men don’t have to hide their childish propensities and politically incorrect humor anymore. Load up his stocking with Liquid Ass ($8), an NSFW egg mold ($8), a cat-shaped magnet ($13), or a Russian roulette water balloon ($17) SEE ALSO:",

The BKX index of bank stocks is up about 15% since the election versus a 3% rise in the S&P 500.\nTrump on Wednesday named the former Goldman Sachs banker Steven Mnuchin as Treasury secretary.  Steve Bannon, Trump's incoming chief strategist, is also a Goldman Sachs alum.  \nTrump is also reportedly  considering Goldman Sachs president Gary Cohn to be his budget chief. \nNOW WATCH: The real estate tricks billionaires use to sell their penthouses faster and for more money \n",

      "text": "For two years, Adam French knew he was leaving Goldman Sachs . “The day I quit was quite liberating – it’s just not that easy to step away from a Goldman job,” says the former trader, and chief executive and co-founder of digital investment management firm Scalable Capital. There was no “eureka moment”, he adds – rather “the transition out took about three months. It was all analysing the market, having chats with compliance consultants, researching what was already out there and what needed to be done to bring this to fruition.”\n\nFrench set up the German arm of his business , which operates there and in the UK, in 2014. His co-founder in Germany , Florian Prucker, had been a colleague at Goldman. “We’d just spent two years upgrading all of the technology that we used within the trading desk to automate our jobs. We scaled from 1,000 trades a day to 10,000.”\n\nThe problem the pair had lay outside of work, however. “Friends and family kept asking what to do with their money. If you know someone working at Goldman, you assume they’ll know, but we didn’t. We felt like there was nowhere we could send people that was accessible (they’re normal people, not millionaires), low-cost and good.”\n\nFrench and Prucker started building a solution they believed would change that – and bringing on more founders to help them do it. Here in the UK, where Scalable launched this year, French was joined by Dr Manuela Rabener and Simon Miller. “Simon actually has a similar background to me, having worked at Barclays. When we started out, it was him and me working in my kitchen.” Rabener, who heads up marketing, is ex-Mckinsey and a serial entrepreneur.\n\n*Relative to absolute risk*\n\nScalable Capital aims to provide institutional-level investing to the retail investor. Like older firms in the space (whose coat tails French says Scalable is lucky to be riding on), it uses exchange-traded funds (ETFs) to invest across all major asset classes. And like others, it currently requires a £5,000 minimum investment, with an all-in fee of 0.75 per cent per annum. “The first wave of financial technology changed the packaging. But the technology underneath was still the old technology, the old business processes that the financial industry has used since the ‘80s.”\n\nThe Scalable team wanted to go beyond packaging and use technology to create a new product. “The traditional investment industry relies on ‘expertise’ and active management. We want to remove that. We know that technology can do so much better when it comes to money management than humans can because it’s unemotional, and millions of eventualities and processes can be simulated.”\n\nScalable has built an algorithm which aims to do just this: draw data and model a complex world without having to make simplifications or assumptions – and without layers of people and process, which add cost. The firm calculates that a £100,000 investment, with a 6 per cent return, would yield £12,716 more than a traditional investment manager. Over 30 years, that’s £93,523.\n\nRather than focus on building teams of operations or sales people, the bulk of Scalable’s 42-strong team are financial and software engineers. As an investor, rather than be put on a risk scale – a two for taking less risk, or a seven, say, if you’re willing to take more – Scalable uses a percentage scale to ascertain how much you’re willing to lose. So if you’re at 15 per cent, that’s the hit you’d be willing to take in a really bad year.\n\n“We want to move away from relative risk to absolute risk. We run simulations on an individual portfolio basis, so even if you’re in the same risk category as someone else, your portfolios might look different. You might have joined on different days, so certain trades would have made sense for one person but not the other.” French is confident the business will continue to personalise its approach, with plans to factor in things like how much tax someone is paying.\n\nUsing ETFs helps with this, he says. “Unlike in Germany, where they’ve been sold by banks as financial instruments, these are still a relatively new product in the UK in terms of how people think about them. But, when it comes to assets under management, they’re larger than hedge funds, and bring the best of both worlds: diversified holdings and traded on stock exchanges. Using them means real-time pricing and daily liquidity. We can get out of an instrument whenever we want and, because they’re passive in nature, we’re not paying a manager.”\n\nI ask why people can’t just go and buy ETFs themselves. French says the answer lies in convenience: “with 1,500 ETFs on the market in the UK alone, which should you invest in? That’s a problem 99.9 per cent of people don’t know how to solve. And even if you do make simplified assumptions and sit with a spreadsheet, that’s not what most people want to be doing.”\n\n*Robo? Oh no*\n\nInterestingly, while robo-advisers are often treated with a degree of scepticism in the UK press, says French, Germans have been more enthusiastic. “The landscape is very different there. There’s 1,600 banks versus our 400, and no independent financial adviser (IFA) market. If you wanted investment advice you’d go into a bank and ask about the product of the month. Combined with negative interest rates and people having to pay for the privilege of sitting on their cash, robo-advisers have been welcomed as a fantastic alternative to a less developed market driven by sales, rather than advice.”Manuela Rabener and Simon Miller joined French as UK co-founders, where Scalable Capital launched this year (Source: Greg Sigston / City A.M.)\n\nFrench admits he “hates the label robo-adviser. It’s something that’s come out of the US and been put on anyone doing something that’s online and investing. But the idea that we’re providing advice is completely wrong. It’s a moniker that exists because people don’t understand that there’s a fiduciary relationship out there that’s accessible – because they’ve never seen it before. ‘Robo’ always gets attached to new technology – traffic lights were originally called ‘robo-traffic wardens’. Hopefully we’re not far off this just being called investing!”\n\nNext year, Scalable, which has raised around £10m to date, will go for more funding. While it’s deliberately focused on a fairly niche, mass-affluent market so far, it’ll press on with penetrating the UK market more widely, in addition to rolling out a Sipp (you can already open an Isa). French is also excited about B2B opportunities for the firm – i.e. selling their product to banks.\n\n“We’ve started to have conversations with big firms. They all know they need to do something, and either they do it in-house or buy other firms’ products. They don’t have the expertise, so they’re turning to fintechs. And it’s difficult for them because they can’t cannibalise their own discretionary services by building an online tool that’s better. We’ve already got the systems in place for white labelling, and I think we’ll see the theme of collaboration more widely develop a lot in 2017.”\n\nIn the meantime, French has found himself on a cycle of coffees with banking friends and ex-colleagues. “While I was on gardening leave I was getting internal phone calls all the time wanting to know how I did it. It was the right time for me – I’m married but don’t have kids or a big mortgage. I made good money but saved it.” But the number of meetings has dwindled. “I was meeting someone once a week when we started out, but I’ve had fewer conversations recently – perhaps because I’m getting busier, perhaps because the market’s changing. A lot of people are tied to their job, but they really want to move out and start a technology-driven business.\"",
