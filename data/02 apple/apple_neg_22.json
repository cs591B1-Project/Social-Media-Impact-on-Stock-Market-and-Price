      "title": "Tip of the Day: Working with Threads in iOS 10 Mail",
      "text": "Working with Threads in iOS 10 Mail   17 minutes ago \nApple has made some nice changes to the way that message threads are handled in the iOS 10 Mail app, replacing the prior message sub-list with an inline conversation view that users of alternative mail apps and platforms like Gmail will find far more familiar. In addition to presenting all of the messages in a single threaded view, in the Mail app now includes all of the messages in your entire mail account by default, rather than only those in the current mailbox or folder. \nOf course, if you don’t like this fully threaded view there are still options to turn it off. The Mail section in the main iOS Settings app now includes a Threading section which, in addition to the global “Organize by Thread” option found in prior iOS versions, now also includes settings to sort threads in reverse chronological order, as well as turn off “Complete Threads” if you want to revert the pre-iOS 10 behavior of only showing messages from the current mailbox/folder in each thread. In the latter case you’ll still get the newer threaded view — there’s no way to go back to the old hierarchical message list design — but any messages that are not contained in the same mailbox/folder as the current message won’t be displayed. \nAnother handy trick is that swipe options also work in the threaded view on a per-message basis, so you can archive, reply, flag, move, or trash individual messages from within the thread. Just swipe left or right on the message you’d like to take action on, as you would in the normal message list, and the relevant options will appear. Note that Reply and Trash are fixed buttons, while the other buttons will be the same as the ones for the main message list, which can be customized in Swipe Options in your Mail settings.",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple Releases New 'Bulbs' Ad Highlighting MacBook Pro Touch Bar by Abdel Ibrahim November 17, 2016 \nApple uploaded a new MacBook Pro ad to its YouTube channel today called “Bulbs” which highlights some of the major inventions and breakthroughs throughout time. \nCalled “Bulbs”, the commercial features hundreds of lightbulbs that explode alongside a time-lapse of major innovations starting with fire, the invention of the wheel and running through such breakthroughs such as flight, the telephone, the television, cameras, computers, and even space flight before ending with a look at the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar . \nThe ad ends with a line that reads “Ideas push the world forward” and then shows the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar for just a couple seconds. \nCall me crazy, but while I love the cinematography in this ad, ending with the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar seems a bit strange. This ad almost seems better suited for the iPhone or even the iPad given that they both likely have a brighter future than the Mac. Or maybe the Mac has a longer life ahead of it than I’m anticipating. \nEither way, it’s a good commercial. View Comments Copyright 2016 AppAdvice LLC. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Reddit \nApple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has slowly been making its way into the hands of consumers gradually over the past week and many have already started to offer up their opinions on the new machine. While the new Touch Bar models first hit retail stores earlier this week , they are now available for pickup in store via Apple’s website, as well. \nAs noted on Apple’s website , you can now order a new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar from the Apple Online Store and pick it up in store. As is usually the case with new products, pickup times vary wildly depending on your market. In general, the base $1799 Touch Bar model is available for same-day pickup in a decent number of markets, though the $1999 model is slightly harder to find for same-day pickup. \nAs far as the 15-inch models go, the $2399 model is widely not available for same-day pickup, while the $2999 model is even more scarce. As time progresses, though, this should improve and the machines will become readily available in Apple’s retail stores. \nIn the instances where the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is not available for same-day pickup, Apple lists December 30th as the pickup date, which coincidences with the 4-5 week shipping window it currently lists for all Touch Bar models. Given the widespread availability of the 13-inch Touch Bar model, however, it’s likely that the 4-5 week shipping window will start to decrease at some point in the near future for that model. \nReviews of the new MacBook Pro models with Touch Bar emerged earlier this week and noted of the device’s power and design improvements. As for the Touch Bar itself, reactions have been mixed thus far. Our own Jeff Benjamin noted in his hands-on that while he strongly disliked the Touch Bar at first, he’s slowly been growing more fond of it as he continues to use it and grow accustomed. \nHow does availability of the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar look in your market? Let us know down in the comments. Watch our hands-on with the Touch Bar model below and read our review roundup here. Guides",

      "text": "PlayStation Vue Expands Again, Now Available on Apple TV Apple TV joins the mix. Last updated by Eddie Makuch on November 17, 2016   You are now subscribed   \nSony's PlayStation TV-streaming service, PlayStation Vue, launched on Apple TV today, expanding its footprint even further. In a PlayStation Blog post , Sony said Apple TV was one of the \"most highly requested devices\" for the service. \nPlayStation Vue works on fourth generation Apple TV devices and supports the system's Siri remote. People who have an existing PlayStation Vue account can link their subscription to Apple TV to get started. Newcomers can sign up for a streaming package, which starts at $30/month. \nBe aware that not all plans are available in every market; go to the PlayStation Vue website and enter your zip code to find out what plans are available where you live. \nPlayStation Vue can be streamed to up to five devices at the same time. In addition to Apple TV, the service is offered on PlayStation 4 , PlayStation 3 , PC , and smartphone/tablet. \nThe service's expansion to Apple TV today comes after Sony announced last week that PlayStation Vue had lost all Viacom-owned networks , including Comedy Central, MTV, Nickelodeon, and Spike. \nPlayStation Vue debuted in some US markets in 2015 before launching in full this March . Prices have been adjusted a number of times as platform availability and the channel lineup changed. In July, it reportedly topped the 100,000 subscribers mark . Filed under:",

      "text": "Starting today, Apple has made in-store pickup available for the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar in the United States , allowing customers to check stock at their local store and reserve a machine online.\n\nThe MacBook Pro first started popping up in retail stores on Tuesday, but because there was no in-store pickup option, there was no way to tell which stores had stock and which didn't. It's now much easier to see which locations have MacBook Pro models available for immediate purchase.\nMany stores around the country are listing December 30 pickup dates for the higher-end 13-inch MacBook Pro model and the two 15-inch models, but there are some locations where the new MacBook Pros are currently in stock. The entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar appears to be much more widely available than other machines.\n\nA MacBook Pro with Touch Bar ordered from the Apple online store today won't ship for approximately four to five weeks, so checking local stock on a daily basis is a good way to get a model with a standard configuration much more quickly.\n\nPrices on the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar start at $1,799 for the 13-inch model and go up to $2,799 for the 15-inch model, with additional processor, storage, and GPU boosts available for additional fees.\nRelated Roundup: MacBook Pro\nBuyer's Guide: MacBook Pro (Buy Now)\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "Apple this week unveiled its latest product, a hardbound photo book that showcases 20 years of Apple products, highlighting every Mac, iPhone, iPod, and iPad released between 1998 and 2015.\n\nBecause it's positioned as an art piece, Apple's \"Designed by Apple in California \" book costs a jaw dropping $200 to $300 depending on size, so we thought we'd take a look inside to see just what you're getting for that price tag.\nSubscribe to the MacRumors YouTube channel for more videos.\n\nAside from a dedication page dedicating the book to former Apple CEO Steve Jobs, a foreword by Apple design chief Jony Ive, and an insert with product descriptions, the book is text-free, filled with large, high-quality images of Apple products. There are 450 images in total, with multiple photographs of each item to highlight its design process. It starts with the 1998 iMac, one of the first products Ive designed at Apple, and ends with the 2015 Apple Pencil.\n\nAccording to Apple, it took eight years to design the linen-bound hardcover book, which features specially milled, custom-dyed paper with \"gilded matte silver edges,\" and low-ghost ink. As can be seen in the video, the book is of the highest quality with gorgeous photographs, but its price limits its appeal to the general public.\n\n\"Designed by Apple in California\" can only be purchased from the online Apple Store and at select Apple retail locations around the world. It's priced at $199 for a 10.2x12.8 inch version, and $299 for a 13x16.3 inch version.Tag: Designed by Apple in California\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "title": "Public Access - Weigh in on the MacBook Pro's missing SD slot",
      "text": "Share Save \nWhat happens when Apple 'fanboys' camp outside the apple store for days so that they can be the first one to get their hands on the new apple product? Apple becomes so full of themselves that they increase their prices while decreasing features. Straight off the bat you are paying 200 USD more (even more if you are in Europe) than what you had to pay for the previous MacBook pro, which is a bit of a slap in the face considering Apple products are not exactly wallet friendly any way. In order to justify this price increase apple has removed the function keys and given you a touch bar in place of them, at first glance it would seem a bit 'gimmicky' and not really very useful and in my opinion that is exactly what it is. But hey it sure looks fancy and aesthetics are better than functionality. Another thing that Apple has decided to do away with is the SD card reader, the genius designers at Apple have decided that a dongle would be much less cumbersome than a little slot where your SD card goes. This is what has Apple said about the removal of the SD card slot; Phil Schiller claims that the slot was cumbersome and your card juts outward. I don't see what he means by a little hole being cumbersome, possibly in regards to making the MacBook thicker? It is a little annoying that the card sticks out a bit, other manufacturers have addressed this problem by having a slot where your Sd card goes right in. He also said that people who use CompactFlash or XQD cards were forced to get an external reader, now everyone is forced to get an external reader that Apple is happy to sell to you. Another reason/excuse for the lack of SD card slot is that many newer cameras have built in wireless transfer technology, so you may need to buy a new camera with your new computer. On the topic of wireless apple has developed it's own wireless chips , this may sound a little cynical but what's the bet that Apple will charge manufacturers to use their wireless chip so that they are able to connect to apple devices? In short what the missing SD card reader says to me is shameless money grabbing, you will need to purchase a dongle for HDMI, USB and SD readers. But is this really a surprise? Iphone has been missing the ability of adding a micro SD card despite the fact that other smartphones have this functionality. For the same price as what you pay for a MacBook pro you could get a higher spec windows PC with all the ports you need and possibly a touch screen instead of a touch bar!

What if you get a chance to have an elegant notebook with 450 photos of their products? You can showcase it like a hardcore apple fan. \nYou don’t have to wait anymore! Apple announced the launch of such a hardcover notebook and, you can order it now on their website. Moreover, it will be available in selected Apple retail stores soon as well. Apple Releases a New Book Containing 450 Images of its Products \nWhat do you think is the name of that book? \nIt’s Designed by Apple in California . They didn’t care to give up the pricing tradition with this product as well. \nThe book is available in two size variants. The first one having 3″ x 16.25″ edition costs $299 whereas the smaller one of 10.20″ x 12.75″ costs $199. There are no other differences between both the versions, just the price. \nApple’s new notebook depicts the last 20 years in the history of the company. Andrew Zuckerman is the guy who was behind the camera . The product lineup featured in the book starts from iMac from 1998. \nWe all know and we praise the industrial design of Apple. Thanks to the legendary Steve Jobs. The notebook excels in its design. Apple published it by themselves. They dedicate the same to the memory of Steve Jobs. \nAlso Read :- Apple is not the First Company to Come up With a Touch Bar. Guess Who? \nYou can read the following lines in the foreword section of the book. \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nThe custom-dyed paper is what Apple used to make this book and, it features edges of glided matte silver. Linen bounds the cover and they told that it took them eight years to complete the book. \nApple included the themes of the last Macbook Pro events in the book. Given that people have mixed reactions to their recently launched products, we are unsure about whether we can find them in a position to unveil such a book after 20 years or not.

      "text": "– A + Apple's Touch Bar MacBook Pro available for in-store pickup, stock limited By AppleInsider Staff \nThursday, November 17, 2016, 02:44 pm PT (05:44 pm ET) \nApple on Thursday activated in-store pickup as an online order option for new MacBook with Touch Bar models, though initial stock checks show extremely limited availability nationwide.\n\n\n\n\nAccording to Apple's website, a limited number of brick-and-mortar retail outlets have both 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar units ready for pickup today. Availability is anything but consistent, however, as many stores are estimated to have stock on hand on Dec. 30. \n\nAs can be expected, Apple outlets in major metropolitan areas like New York and California are receiving units first. At the time of this writing, entry-level 13-inch Touch Bar MacBook stock appears to be most prevalent as smaller regional locations and mall outlets are showing immediate availability. Stock on hand diminishes up the product line, though flagship stores currently have top-tier configurations up for sale. \n\nStock is still constrained for the 15-inch Touch Bar variant, and even more so for top of the line models sporting Intel's 2.7GHz quad-core Core i7 processor. \n\nSome stores, like Apple's Fifth Avenue flagship, have all Touch Bar MacBook models in stock and ready to pick up today. Those interested in bypassing current shipment estimates of four to five weeks are urged to check pickup availability on Apple's MacBook Pro purchase webpage .\n\nAnnounced in October , Apple's new Touch Bar MacBook Pros arrived in the hands of early preorder customers on Monday , with Apple retail stores receiving display models a day later .",

      "text": "The AirPlay loophole is chipping away at iTunes' monopoly on Apple TV The AirPlay loophole is chipping away at iTunes' monopoly on Apple TV Commentary: A recent change to Vudu's iOS app lets you play videos on your Apple TV -- despite the fact that there's no official app on the box itself. The AirPlay loophole is chipping away at iTunes' monopoly on Apple TV 0 Share: \nWatching my Vudu copy of \"Office Space\" on the Apple TV via AirPlay Photo by John Falcone/CNET \nThe Apple TV box has only gotten better since its debut in 2015, with thousands of new apps and plenty of usability improvements via software updates. Even more improvements -- single sign-on for some cable and satellite providers and the new TV app -- are due by the end of the year. \nBut if the product has one frustration point, it's the continued lack of alternatives for buying or renting TV shows and movies. (I'm not counting \"all you can eat\" subscription services like Netflix, Hulu and HBO Now, since you can't choose individual titles.) While Roku has several to choose from -- including Amazon, Google Play Movies and TV, Vudu and Fandango Now -- Apple TV only has iTunes. \nAt least, that's the case if you count what's available in the Apple TV app store. But if you use AirPlay -- Apple's standard for streaming audio and video -- you can watch content on an Apple TV box from all three of those rival video stores if your iPad or iPhone is on the same Wi-Fi network. Apple TV gets... TV app Apple's new TV app aims to put all your live and on-demand TV content in one place. 1:39 Close Drag \nThe Vudu iOS app just added full AirPlay compatibility to the Walmart-owned online video service earlier this week. Just start playing a Vudu movie or TV show on your iPhone or iPad, and you can toggle the video over to a nearby Apple TV at the touch of an icon. \nI tried it with two or three titles on Vudu and Google Play, and it worked fine. The video quality on the Apple TV was smooth and relatively sharp, and you can use either your iOS device or the Apple TV remote to scrub through what you're watching. Using Amazon's app, though, you need to engage AirPlay Mirroring mode: It's a bit less flexible, and means you have to control everything through your iPhone or iPad, and you need to leave the video on the device's screen -- you can't click away to another app, as you can with normal AirPlay. The video quality in Mirroring mode also suffers a bit. \nOf course, AirPlay is not as convenient as having these native apps on Apple TV. Asked about their continued absence, an Apple spokesperson said, \"As we've said time and time again, we welcome all kinds of apps to the Apple TV platform.\" And yet, Vudu's spokesperson reaffirmed, \"We're not currently on Apple TV and don't have an update to share at this time.\" \nThe problem, as usual, comes down to money. Under the current App Store structure, vendors are required give a 30 percent cut of every sale or rental to Apple. Companies like Walmart, Google and Amazon don't want to cut into their already slim profit margins -- let alone transfer money to a strategic rival. That's why their iOS apps let you view your video library, but don't let you make in-app purchases of new videos. \nReported changes to Apple's revenue share model may change the balance of that equation, though it's unclear if those unconfirmed changes only apply to subscription services such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling TV and the just-launched PlayStation Vue. \nIn the meantime, taking advantage of the AirPlay loophole is a good compromise.",

If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. \nAlthough Apple never uses the phrase, this is a fix for \" touch disease .\" \nThe problem occurs when certain iPhone models — the iPhone 6 Plus, in particular — have an issue with an internal part and the display flickers, displays a grey bar at the top, and becomes unresponsive to touch. \nThe issue was fairly widespread, according to our readers, who emailed us frequently after we covered the issue in October. Most people were frustrated that Apple, although it appeared to be aware of the issue, would still charge out-of-warranty customers $329 for a fix. \nApple says it will reimburse customers the difference if they already paid the $329 to get thier iPhone 6 Plus fixed. Frustratingly, Apple is still claiming the issue is caused not by an engineering defect, but rather because the phones were \"dropped multiple times on a hard surface.\" \nYou can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed at Apple retail stores and authorized service providers.",

      "text": "Reddit \nApple today has launched a new repair program for iPhone 6 Plus users affected by the widely reported on “Touch Disease” hardware flaw . This flaw centers around an iPhone’s display becoming unresponsive and displaying a thin gray flickering line along the top. \nAs part of the new repair program, Apple will repair affected devices for a flat service price of $149. \nApple writes on its website that it has determined that “some” iPhone 6 Plus units are plagued by the problem. The company, however, attributes such issues to the device having been dropped multiple times on a hard surface rather than a manufacturing flaw. \nThe issues were reported on back in August with an in-depth investigation describing the affected iPhone 6 Plus models as “ticking time bombs just waiting to act up.” \nApple writes the following concerning the issues: \nApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. \nIf your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149. \n\nApple also says it will be contacting customers who already paid for repairs to refund them the difference, and otherwise encourages customers who think their device might be affected to contact the company. \nIn order to have your devices repaired, you can visit either an Apple Authorized Service Provider, an Apple Retail Store, or contact Apple Technical Support and send in your damaged device. \nIt’s unclear how affected customers will respond to Apple’s repair program seeing that there’s still a $149 charge associated with getting their device repaired. Apple has been hit with multiple class action lawsuits concerning the issue, so it will be interesting to see how the new repair program affects those lawsuits . \nIf your device is affected by Touch Disease, you can head to Apple’s website now to start the process of getting your phone repaired to working order.

      "text": "Apple Launches 'Touch Disease' Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus Thursday November 17, 2016 3:07 pm PST by Juli Clover Apple today launched a new repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus , addressing complaints about a manufacturing issue that can cause the iPhone 6 Plus to become unresponsive to touch. According to Apple, some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit Multi-Touch issues after \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface,\" causing damage to the device. Under its repair program, Apple will fix affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for a service price of $149. Customers who paid more than $149 to have their devices fixed before the repair program was implemented will be able to get their money reimbursed by Apple. Complaints about the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issue started in August, after iFixit published a video highlighting the bug and dubbed it \" Touch Disease .\" Touch Disease presents as a gray flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that becomes unresponsive or less responsive to touch. The problem is believed to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, making repairs difficult. Third-party repair outlets speculated that the issue could be linked to the same structural design flaw that caused the major \"Bendgate\" controversy, and Apple's suggestion that it is caused by repeated physical damage seems to confirm that. Customers who have an iPhone 6 Plus with Multi-Touch issues can visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple retail store to see if they qualify for the $149 repair fee.",

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Apple Retains Far More iPhone Call Data Than You May Realize \nApple continuously stores customers’ call history on its iCloud servers for as long as four months, cautioned Elcomsoft, a Russian computer forensics firm, on Thursday. \nAnyone who uses an iPhone or iPad automatically transmits this private information—including phone numbers, dates, and length of calls—to Apple when iCloud is enabled, the firm said. Privacy buffs will note that Apple can provide law enforcement with the encryption keys that unlock the data because the company holds onto these data-unscrambling cryptographic secrets. \n“There is no way to hide your calls from government requests other than disabling iCloud Drive ,” wrote Vlatamir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft, in a company blog post . Get Data Sheet , Fortune ’s technology newsletter. \nIn addition to logging regular call history, Apple appears to be keeping records of metadata associated with FaceTime calls at least since the introduction of the iOS 8.2 version of its mobile software in March 2015, The Intercept reports . \nIt’s worth noting that FaceTime employs end-to-end encryption that protects the audio and visual content of messages sent over the service, as Apple’s security guide lays out. Elcomsoft said that its findings contradicted other statements in the iOS security guide, however. \nFor instance, Apple says that it “has no information as to whether the FaceTime call was successfully established or duration of a FaceTime call” and that “FaceTime call invitation logs are retained up to 30 days.” Elcomsoft, on the other hand, said it found that iCloud accounts do indeed retain this information. \n“Synced data contains full information including call duration and both parties,” Katalov wrote in his post. He added that “we were able to extract information going back more than 4 months ago.” \nApple also appears to retain the metadata records associated with popular communications apps that rely on Apple CallKit, the company’s voice integration tool, since its debut of iOS 10, Elcomsoft said. Among the set are Microsoft’s msft Skype, Facebook’s fb WhatsApp, and Viber. For more on iPhones, watch: \nElcomsoft further noted that when someone downloads synced call logs, users are not notified, unlike when iCloud backups are downloaded. Katalov said that this “effectively allows spying upon you without you even knowing.” \nElcomsoft gained notoriety in 2014 when a hacker reportedly used the company’s software to download personal photos of celebrities from their iCloud accounts. \nApple did not immediately reply to Fortune’s request for comment. A company spokesperson provided the following statement, however, to Forbes , which first reported the news, as well as The Intercept: “ We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices. Apple is deeply committed to safeguarding our customers’ data.” \n“That’s why we give our customers the ability to keep their data private,” the note continued. “Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.” \nHackers looking to get their hands on people’s call histories can be foiled by two-factor authentication, an essential security feature that adds an extra layer of security to online accounts, Elcomsoft said. Those looking to keep their communications logs from the eyes of prying government authorities might have more to worry about, though. \nOf course, investigators can also obtain call records from telecom providers . Chris Soghoian, chief technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, told The Intercept that he was more worried about other aspects of iCloud’s data management. \n“The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind,” Soghoian said. “There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.” \nApple, for its part, won acclaim from privacy buffs for its strong stance in a high-profile legal battle with the Federal Bureau of Investigation over access to the encrypted contents of an iPhone used by a terrorist. The company refused to write software that would allow the Feds to extract the phone’s PIN code and stored data, and it ultimately avoided a protracted legal battle when the FBI found an alternate means of entry via a third-party contractor.",

      "text": "Home > Apple > See Apple grow: New coffee table book spotlights… See Apple grow: New coffee table book spotlights evolution of its product design November 17, 2016 2:49 PM Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nThe word “conceited,” according to Merriam-Webster’s Learner’s Dictionary, means “having or showing too much pride in your own worth or goodness.” Some would argue that Facebook, which aims to connect every single person on Earth, falls into that category. Others would argue that Google, which seeks to parse all of the world’s information, also meets that definition. But it’s tough to argue that Apple’s new collectible doesn’t take that brand of self-importance to a whole new level. On Tuesday, the Cupertino, California-based company unveiled a veritable monument to its accomplishments in the form of “Designed by Apple,” a coffee table book filled with 450 photographs of Apple products. \nThe tome, which features hundreds of “all-new” images shot by Creature author Andrew Zuckerman, showcases the evolution of Apple’s product design over the past 20 years. They’re all shot “in a deliberately spare style,” stripped down to their base silicon components and contrasted against a bright white backdrop. It’s a highlight reel of sorts: the 1998 iMac is presented and accounted for, as is the iPhone, the iPad, Apple Watch, and even the Apple Pencil. \nMore: Users can now donate to their favorite nonprofits through Apple Pay \nIt’s primarily archival — Apple design chief Jony Ive, who wrote the book’s forward, described it as “a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years”— but intended as an educational resource, too. “[I hope it'll provide] a resource for students of all design disciplines,” Ive added. “While this is a design book, it is not about the design team. It is an objective representation of the work that, ironically, describes who we are. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that could there could be no rational alternative.” \nTrue to Apple’s persnickety nature, it leaves no detail overlooked. Every page is specially milled with “custom-dyed” paper and “gilded matte silver edges,” with the prints rendered using “eight color separations” and “low-ghost ink.” And Apple is self-publishing the volume — the product of more than eight collective years of work, the company said — rather than outsourcing the work to a third party. \nMore: The iPhone 7 is about to hit a serious decline in demand, according to analyst \nIt goes on sale Friday in two hardcover sizes, a 10.20 inch by 12.75 inch edition priced at $200, and a 13 inch by 16.25 inch edition for $300. It’ll be available from the company’s website in the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Taiwan, ans Korea, in addition to select Apple Stores. \nIt’s dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. “The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” Ive said.

      "title": "Apple iPhone 7 vs iPhone 6s camera comparison: What sets them apart",
      "text": "0 An iPhone 7 is displayed in a store in London, Britain October 4, 2016. Reuters/Stefan Wermuth \nOne of the best things about the iPhone is its cameras. Apple makes it a point to improve its flagship smartphone’s shooters on every new model. But what exactly sets the cameras of the latest iPhone 7 cameras apart from those of the iPhone 6s? \nA number of Apple iPhone users buy the mobile device because of the quality photos it produces. In fact, four out of five cameras used on popular image hosting site Flickr are iPhones. Let’s break down the camera specs and features of the iPhone 6s and the new iPhone 7. \nThe main shooter of the iPhone 6s is a 12 MP f/2.2 camera with phase detection autofocus and dual-LED flash. The iPhone 7 also sports a 12 MP primary camera, but with an f/1.8 aperture. The wider lens absorbs 60 percent more light. According to Trusted Reviews , this makes the iPhone 7 better at low-light photography. \nAnother major difference is that the iPhone 7 camera has optical image stabilisation and quad-LED flash, both of which the iPhone 6s lacks. Optical image stabilisation works great at coping with shaky hands and jolts to produce steady shots. Both Apple smartphones’ main cameras have support for 4K video and 8 MP image recording, as well as touch focus, face detection and HDR features. \nThe secondary camera of the iPhone 7 is a notch above that of the iPhone 6s. The new iPhone model has a 7 MP f/2.2 front-facing camera while the older variant only equips a 5 MP f/2.2 secondary snapper. This basically means that selfie shots and FaceTime sessions are better with the iPhone 7. Both secondary cameras have face detection, HDR and panorama features. Both are able to produce 1080p videos at 30 frames per second and 720p videos at 240 frames per second as well. \nThe new iPhone 7 is definitely better than the iPhone 6s when it comes to cameras. Apple certainly made sure that its new flagship smartphone is worth the upgrade.",

      "text": "Apple Establishes Inverse Right Shoulder, Leads Tech Higher Tom Bowley | November 17, 2016 at 09:00 AM \nMarket Recap for Wednesday, November 16, 2016 \nComputer hardware ($DJUSCR) led a tech-fueled rally on Wednesday that resulted in bifurcated action in our major indices. The NASDAQ finished with a nice 0.36% gain while the Russell 2000 was flat and the Dow Jones and S&P 500 ended with losses of 0.29% and 0.16%, respectively. The NASDAQ's outperformance of the Dow Jones throughout this bull market is quite apparent and I've included it in the Current Outlook section below. Yesterday, it was Apple's (AAPL) turn to lead. AAPL remains in a longer-term bullish inverse head & shoulders pattern and the low on Wednesday may have just marked a very important bottom - especially with the next couple months being so bullish historically. Here's the weekly AAPL chart: \nIn all honesty, this inverse head & shoulders pattern is sloppy and not easy to recognize. For a pattern to play out, it's best if it can be recognized by traders. In addition to the sketchy inverse H&S pattern, however, we've seen a bullish MACD crossover and the recent lows have held rising 20 week EMA support (blue arrows). This week's candle currently is a hammer, although we still have two days of action before the final weekly candle prints. But that current candle is bullish and AAPL's weekly volume is likely to be its highest since September. \nTreasuries remain under intense pressure and the corresponding yields won't seem to fall back. There is a potential topping pattern in play on the 10 year treasury yield ($TNX), however. Should we see a gap down in the TNX, there'd be an island cluster reversal printing and a likely short-term top. On a pullback, consider the rising 20 day EMA as key support. Here's the chart: \nThe blue circle highlights the \"cluster\" of candles that follow an extended uptrend. This island cluster forms if we see a gap down below the cluster. That leaves these candles on an \"island\" and many times will mark a short-term top that's followed by at least a near-term downtrend. Should that occur, I'd expect to see support marked in the 1.95%-2.00% area. \nPre-Market Action \nWal-Mart (WMT) beat consensus estimates on its quarterly earnings (.98 vs .96), but the stock is down in pre-market action this morning. There are many economic reports out this morning, with jobless claims down significantly while housing starts and building permits both came in much better than expected. \nCrude oil prices ($WTIC) are up 1.27% at last check this morning and that should bode well for the energy sector again today. Global markets were mostly mixed and near their respective flat lines. That's led to little movement in U.S. futures as the Dow Jones futures are down 7 points with 30 minutes left to the opening bell. \nCurrent Outlook \nOne bullish signal is to witness market participants investing/trading with a \"risk on\" mentality. If traders begin to lose interest in riskier investments, it's a signal of rising fear and that's an environment for consolidation, or worse, bear markets. The following is a long-term weekly chart showing the relative performance of NASDAQ stocks vs. the safer Dow Jones: \nThe S&P 500 gained more than 40% during 2013 and 2014 and if you look at the above chart, you'll see that the NASDAQ soared relative to the Dow Jones during those two years and into 2015. Since then, it's been choppier, but let's give the NASDAQ a break. That tech-laden index rose in parabolic fashion vs. the Dow Jones and deserved a period of relative consolidation - at a minimum. We appear to have started a fresh period of outperformance (since early April) and the bounce the past couple trading sessions in the NASDAQ is helping it hold its relative uptrend line vs. the Dow Jones over the past six months. \nRelative resistance formed in the latter half of 2014 in the .265-.270 range. We saw that relative resistance level give way in 2015 and we tested what became relative support in the first half of 2016. Traders now seem to be more willing to take on risk now and that's a good sign. Watch relative support at .265 and relative resistance at .295. Whichever level breaks first is likely to send us our longer-term directional signal. My guess is we see a breakout to the upside. \nSector/Industry Watch \nThe Dow Jones U.S. Medical Supplies Index ($DJUSMS) was the best performing industry group within the healthcare sector yesterday, but the question is....is this the right shoulder in a topping head & shoulders pattern or is this simply consolidation unwinding recent overbought conditions before the next breakout? You be the judge: \nAs the recent price low, RSI had dipped back to 40. You can see from the black arrows above that every time in the past three years that the weekly RSI has touched 40, we've marked a significant bottom. This last trip to RSI 40 accompanied a test of price support at 680. This is an important price low so beware a breakdown here. In the meantime, I'd look for another push towards 745-750. \nHistorical Tendencies \nWe are approaching a VERY bullish historical period on the S&P 500. Since 1950, the S&P 500 has moved higher from the November 20th close (this year November 18th close since the 20th falls on a Sunday) to the December 6th close 49 times out of the last 66 years. This rally around the Thanksgiving holiday has produced an annualized return of 31.37%, which is more than 3 times the 9% average annual returns the S&P 500 has enjoyed over these 6+ decades. This history doesn't mean we can't go lower, but it certainly favors the bulls as technical conditions continue to improve. \nKey Earnings Reports",

      "text": "Apple today launched a new repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus, addressing complaints about a manufacturing issue that can cause the iPhone 6 Plus to become unresponsive to touch.\n\nAccording to Apple, some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit Multi-Touch issues after \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface,\" causing damage to the device. Under its repair program, Apple will fix affected iPhone 6 Plus devices for a service price of $149.\nCustomers who paid more than $149 to have their devices fixed before the repair program was implemented will be able to get their money reimbursed by Apple.\n\nComplaints about the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issue started in August, after iFixit published a video highlighting the bug and dubbed it \"Touch Disease.\" Touch Disease presents as a gray flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that becomes unresponsive or less responsive to touch.\n\nThe problem is believed to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, making repairs difficult. Third-party repair outlets speculated that the issue could be linked to the same structural design flaw that caused the major \"Bendgate\" controversy, and Apple's suggestion that it is caused by repeated physical damage seems to confirm that.\n\nCustomers who have an iPhone 6 Plus with Multi-Touch issues can visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple retail store to see if they qualify for the $149 repair fee.\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "Apple Launches Multi-Touch Repair Program For The iPhone 6 Plus By Tyler Lee on 11/17/2016 15:35 PST \nBack in August, it seems that there was an increase in reports of iPhone 6 Plus units experiencing some kind of touch issue with their phone’s display . Dubbed the “Touch Disease”, Apple’s inaction led to a class-action lawsuit , but the good news is that it looks like Apple might have the answer to your problem. \nThe company has announced that they will be launching a multi-touch repair program aimed at the iPhone 6 Plus in which they will fix the flickering and touch issues plaguing the phone. This won’t be a free repair since presumably by now warranties for the iPhone 6 Plus have already run the clock, but we guess it is cheaper than buying a new device. \nAccording to the company, “Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.” \nAs for those who paid to have their phones repaired by Apple prior to this announcement, Apple said that they will be getting in contact with these customers and will be refunding them the difference. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones .

Most people were frustrated that Apple, although it appeared to be aware of the issue, would still charge out-of-warranty customers $329 for a fix. \nApple says it will reimburse customers the difference if they already paid the $329 to get thier iPhone 6 Plus fixed. Frustratingly, Apple is still claiming the issue is caused not by an engineering defect, but rather because the phones were \"dropped multiple times on a hard surface.\" \nYou can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed at Apple retail stores and authorized service providers.",

      "title": "Microsoft Surface Studio review: a beautiful invader of Apple's base",
      "text": "The heart of the Surface Studio is its 28-inch PixelSense display. It’s stunning to look at and it’s truly one of the best desktop monitors I’ve ever used. It makes things feel oddly lifelike because you can’t see the pixels — text, videos, and pictures just look great on this thing. You can even hold a piece of paper up to the screen and the Word documents shown on-screen will be the same size. The only way you could improve this monitor is if it was OLED like Lenovo’s ThinkPad X1 Yoga .\nThe Studio uses a 4500 x 3000 (192 dpi) resolution, primarily because it actually has a 3:2 aspect ratio. That’s really unusual for desktop monitors, but it matches the same ratio used on the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book devices. I love extra vertical space for reading and writing, even if it takes a little getting used to on a display of this size. The display is glossy and reflective, but I didn't find that too troublesome in my own office space.\nThe Studio also doubles as a giant tablet This beautiful display also doubles as a giant tablet — sort of. The entire display is incredibly thin at just under 13mm, and supports touch and the same pressure-sensitive Surface Pens found on the Surface tablets. Microsoft is using what it calls a zero-gravity hinge to prop the display up, and you can push on the top of it with a single finger to move the display into various angles.\nEven though it’s easy to adjust, you can still touch or draw at any angle as it has some resistance to being pushed back. I found myself bizarrely pulling the entire display toward me and angling it underneath me to read articles online or even when I was writing because the display is just great to have up close.\nThe real party trick of the Surface Studio is its drawing board mode, and it’s also its biggest selling point. You can push the display all the way down to get really up close to it and start drawing. It won’t sit flat on a desk, though, as the minimum angle is the drawing board mode’s 20 degrees. Microsoft explained to me that it didn’t want people placing their coffee cups on the display and spilling them on a $3,000 PC while they’re drawing.\nThe Dial feels really natural to use To help with the drawing process, Microsoft is also releasing a new accessory: the Surface Dial ( $99 ). It’s a little puck-like device that’s powered by two (AAA) batteries, and it’s designed to be another form of input. You don’t even need a Surface Studio to use the Dial, as it works on any Windows 10 machine with Bluetooth, but it’s paired best with Microsoft’s new PC. Oddly, it's only bundled in the box with Surface Studio preorders, but Microsoft plans to sell it separately otherwise.\nI’ve been using the Dial in my left hand while I draw with my right, and it feels totally natural to use. You can tap on the top, crank the dial around, or tap and hold to access menus and controls. Most of the controls are radial menus that appear when you interact with the Dial. If you place it on top of the Surface Studio then it creates those menus directly under the Dial on the display, and they’ll follow the device wherever you place it.\nI have spent hours drawing with the Surface Studio display and the Dial. As a kid I used to love drawing, but as I got obsessed with building PCs as a teenager, I dropped my pencils in favor of gadgets. The Surface Studio has unexpectedly reignited my interest in drawing, and I’ve sat at my desk doodling away instead of watching TV for entertainment over the past week. As much fun as it’s been, I’m not going to spend $3,000 on a Surface Studio just to doodle in my free time. This device is really designed to go head-to-head with Wacom’s Cintiq displays , so I invited a real artist over to get a better idea of the Surface Studio’s capabilities.\n\"The Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\" Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann Lawrence Mann is a freelance illustrator who typically uses a four-year-old MacBook Pro and Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq display to create his art at home, and a Surface Book on the go. Mann drew parts of two pieces for The Verge over a few hours with the Surface Studio, and came away generally impressed with the Studio.\n\"What astounds me is how close Microsoft have got their experience to what I have already carefully crafted with pieces from three different companies,\" says Mann, referring to his Cintiq, MacBook Pro, and Surface Book combination. Mann thought the accuracy and pen lag seemed comparable to Wacom’s Cintiq, but to be fully satisfied with the Studio he'd like to see some improvements elsewhere. He would like to have the ability to rotate the display, along with a more ergonomic stylus, and some extra buttons on the Dial for more than the basic controls.\n\"Because of the different technologies in use between Wacom and Surface, the Surface Studio does not suffer from the same cursor-to-stylus offset parallax that affects the Wacom Cintiq range,\" explains Mann. \"It’s something that has never been of major importance to me, but I know many others might find it important when they next open their wallet. The Studio’s offset parallax was virtually nothing.\"\nMann says the Studio has left him with a \"lot to think about\" in terms of opening his own wallet. \"I can safely say as a professional digital artist looking to upgrade my main device, the Surface Studio is certainly the strongest contender so far.\"\nApps like Sketchable are where the Surface Dial and Surface Pen really come to life. You can use the Dial to alter brush sizes, paint colors, or spin the canvas around without having to dig through menus and find the option you need. It’s a really quick way to adjust without having to use keyboard shortcuts or navigating away from your work with the pen. I prefer to use the Dial on top of the Surface Studio itself, but I did notice it doesn’t stick to the display very well. Even at the near-flat 20-degree drawing angle, the Dial gradually slipped down the display (perhaps because of oil marks left from using the touchscreen). I noticed it out of the corner of my eye when the radial menus kept bouncing down to keep up with the slipping dial, and it’s distracting and annoying.\nThe other disappointing aspect of the Dial is the lack of app support. There are nearly 20 apps on Microsoft’s official list, but even many of those just have basic zoom or scroll controls, or just the ability to adjust the system volume. Impressive Dial support can be found in Sketchable , Drawboard , or Mental Canvas, but I’m disappointed that apps like Photoshop don’t have full Dial support. Mann is equally surprised: \"I find it remarkable that Adobe haven’t already had all of their applications updated ready for this.\" Microsoft is going up against accessories like Wacom's Express Key Remote ( $99 ), so it needs to prove it's building an app ecosystem around the Dial here. It’s a slow start, but given Microsoft’s push with the Dial I’m quietly confident that most of the apps you’d want to use with it will include support soon.\nAside from the Studio’s creative assets, it’s a PC at heart. At the base of the display is where all the components are housed, in a box that looks like a miniature computer. On the model I was testing there’s a sixth-generation quad-core Intel Core i7 processor, 32GB of RAM, 2TB Rapid Hybrid Drive, and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 980M graphics card inside. That’s actually some old tech for such a futuristic-looking PC. Microsoft has opted for last year's Intel and Nvidia chips, and its storage isn't all solid state. This is especially tough to swallow on the GPU front, because Nvidia's 2016 Pascal architecture is miles ahead of its predecessors. Intel and Nvidia's latest chips simply weren’t ready in time for the Surface Studio, and the storage uses a mix of 128GB SSD with a 2TB hard disk drive. That's disappointing, because even a GTX 1060 would have pushed the Studio into VR gaming, something Microsoft is starting to support directly in Windows 10 .\nThis isn't a gaming PC, but it copes fairly well with games Despite these qualms, the Studio is still very capable. This isn’t designed as a gaming PC, but I found it coped well with games like Gears of War 4 or Forza Horizon 3 . You’re not going to be able to play either on the top settings, but they’re perfectly playable on the Studio if you don’t care about maxing out all the detail. Microsoft has even built in Xbox Wireless support — so you can use any Xbox One controller for games — and a Windows Hello-compatible 1080p camera so you can log into Windows 10 with just your face.\nApps like Photoshop are still super responsive, even if you’re working on files stored on the HDD. The 32GB of RAM will help with multitasking or when working on huge files that demand a lot of memory. And although my workload is relatively light, I wasn't able to overwhelm the Surface Studio at all even with games and multiple apps running side-by-side. Almost similar to most conventional PCs, you also get 4 USB 3.0 ports in total. Microsoft is still steering clear of USB-Type C, for now. Alongside the USB ports there's an SD card reader, headphone jack, and Mini DisplayPort for connecting up a second monitor. You can’t use this DisplayPort to use the Surface Studio as a monitor itself, though.\nAs this is an all-in-one PC, there are still some compromises with the Surface Studio. All of the ports are at the rear, which makes it hard to access them if you have the Studio placed against a wall. This isn’t a silent machine either, and the fan constantly hums away, with the volume depending on how much you’re doing with it. If you’re trying to run some games or process video then you’re going to start hearing it. It’s distracting if you’re used to silence, but it blends into the background otherwise.\nMost of the PC aspects of the Surface Studio are exactly what you’d expect from an all-in-one, and there’s very little to fault here. My main questions are around its price and uses cases. At a starting price of $2,999, it’s up there with Wacom’s 27-inch Cintiq ( $2,799 ), but for that extra $200 you’re getting a full PC and not just a monitor. For creatives, that’s a seriously tempting offer, but you’re really buying the Surface Studio because of its display. It’s stunning, and there’s nothing quite like it on the market right now that has this 3:2 aspect ratio, touch capabilities, and the Surface Pen support, all while being almost pixel perfect and super thin.\nIt’s an engineering marvel of a monitor, but I really wish Microsoft sold it separately. I want to dock my Surface Book to it, or transform any laptop into a full Surface Studio. If I’m investing in a desktop PC at this kind of price then I also really want to be able to upgrade it and use it for gaming and more powerful work. I can’t do either of those things with the Surface Studio. If this was a monitor with a powerful GPU in it designed to complement Microsoft’s existing Surface devices and \"upgrade\" them, I’d probably be throwing my wallet at my screen right now. It’s hard to do so knowing that I’m not getting the latest and greatest specs for that $2,999, and that’s before you even consider the top model I’ve been testing is $4,199.\nMicrosoft is doing what Apple refuses to do That doesn’t discount what Microsoft has attempted to do here. It’s truly something unique and a hint of real innovation we haven’t seen for some years with PCs. Others have tried to experiment, like HP's Sprout , but it's rare to see something more than just an all-in-one. Microsoft’s exciting Surface Studio unveil has been compared to Apple’s disappointing MacBook Pro launch , and with good reason. Many creatives I’ve spoken to about the Surface Studio have said the same thing: why isn’t Apple doing this? Apple seems to be forcing creatives to choose an iPad Pro for touch and pen, but the powerful and professional apps just aren’t there yet on iOS, and it’s not clear if companies like Adobe are willing to rewrite their software to be just as useful on an iPad Pro. Microsoft has realized the potential in the market to reach out to creatives who feel abandoned by Apple, and it’s an influential crowd that could be swayed over by devices like the Surface Studio.\nIt’s still a small part of the overall PC market, though. Creatives will have to weigh up whether this beautiful set of floating pixels is worth the price. If you're already in that price range and considering Wacom's Cintiq — and you don't need a really powerful machine — then the Surface Studio is a no-brainer. For many, the switch from macOS to Windows 10 could be the daunting part, and for others it will be the question of how many apps truly support this new way of working with the Dial.\nThe fact that Microsoft is even being considered an alternative to Apple’s line of machines for creatives is not something anyone, not even Microsoft, was expecting for the Surface devices. The Surface Studio won't take over Mac-focused design houses just yet, but that it’s even a possibility is remarkable. The Studio is special because it knows exactly what it is and who it’s for — and it’s largely spot on. If Microsoft keeps developing its strengths here, some of Apple's most loyal customers might well be tempted to switch camps.\nPhotography by James Bareham.\nVideo by Max Jeffrey and Phil Esposito.\nEdited by Dieter Bohn and Vlad Savov.\nMicrosoft Surface Studio 8.7 Verge Score Good Stuff: Stunning display with 3:2 aspect ratio Thin and handsome industrial design Pen, touchscreen, and Dial support Bad Stuff: Old CPU and GPU Can't use as a monitor Dial needs more apps and a better base Circuit Breaker Google's new Pixel phone case will put the day's news where you can't avoid it Circuit Breaker Star Wars drones are coming to the US just in time for the holiday toy hunger games Circuit Breaker This breadbasket will charge your phone while you overload on carbs View all stories in Circuit Breaker",

      "text": "Apple’s new ‘Bulbs’ Advertisement Showcases MacBook Pro With Touch Bar Posted by Evan Selleck on Nov 17, 2016 | No Comments tweet \nThe MacBook Pro with Touch Bar is now officially on sale at most Apple retail stores, with stock ready to go out the door, so it makes sense that Apple would start to push the advertising for the new laptop family. \nThe latest ad, which was published to Apple’s YouTube page recently, is entitled “Bulbs,” and its focus is on the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. There is a lot going on in the ad, which runs in just over one minute and 30 seconds, all of which puts attention on great inventions, and discoveries like gravity, over the course of history. \nThat includes the lightbulb, of which many explode, and flight, clockwork timekeeping, the rotary phone, and of course there’s some typewriter love in there, too, for good measure. You get to see some robot action, an old iPhone in there, too, but what’s actually curiously left out for most of the ad? The MacBook Pro. You get to see a silhouette of the laptop for a brief moment near the end, and it’s not until around the 1:30 mark in the 1:37-long ad that you finally get to see the Touch Bar in action. \nThe message is clear, though: Apple sees their new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar as a pretty impressive step forward, with plenty of possibility to unlock in that OLED touch panel. A lot of the reviews for the new laptop would agree with that focus on the future, it seems. \nDid you already pick up your MacBook Pro with Touch Bar?",

      "text": "You are using an outdated browser. Please upgrade your browser to improve your experience. Apple Launches a Repair Program for the iPhone 6 Plus 'Touch Disease' by Brent Dirks November 17, 2016 \nApple has just rolled out a new program to repair iPhone 6 Plus units affected by the so-called “touch disease.” The issue came to light earlier this year after a class-action suit was filed in California . A $149 repair fee Credit: iFixit \nInstead of a design flaw, Apple states on the program’s page that the issue is caused when the handset is dropped on hard surfaces: \nApple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device. \nAny handset showing the issues will be repaired by Apple for $149 as long as the iPhone is working and the screen isn’t cracked or broken. \nApple is also planning to contact customers who previously paid a repair fee because of the issue to arrange a reimbursement. \nMore about the program can be found on Apple’s site .

      "text": "Apple says the MacBook Pro is at the pinnacle of great ideas Apple says the MacBook Pro is at the pinnacle of great ideas Technically Incorrect: A new, extravagantly produced ad puts Apple's new computer alongside some of the world's greatest inventions. Like, um, drones. Apple says the MacBook Pro is at the pinnacle of great ideas 0 Share: \nTechnically Incorrect offers a slightly twisted take on the tech that's taken over our lives. Enlarge Image \nThe MacBook Pro. Waiting for your light bulb to explode. Photo by Apple/YouTube screenshot by Chris Matyszczyk/CNET \nRecent political thought has shown us that one of the best ways of selling is to say it loud, say it extravagantly and people will believe you. \nThe truth, in all this, can hang. It's all about the simple words and the uplift. \nApple might be following this in its new ad for the MacBook Pro . It enjoys all the sprawling opulence of Trump Tower. \nThe music suggests that this is less a computer ad, but more a race to the very pinnacle of human thought. \nHere we have light bulbs bursting. Not one, not ten, but hundreds and hundreds. \nWe see images of some of the greatest ideas ever conceived (light bulbs? geddit?). Such as fire, writing and the Apple Newton . Actually, it's not quite the Apple Newton. It's the Apple falling on Sir Isaac Newton's head. But this is hyperbole. Very high perbole. \nThe motorbike, the magnifying glass and the toilet roll all make a fleeting appearance in these 90 seconds. So do the television and the paper clip. Oh, and the drone. Yes, there's a little wit here. After all, the great Tamagotchi makes an appearance. \nWhat's the point of all this? Well, could all these things have been invented on a MacBook Pro? No, it's that the MacBook Pro has been meticulously constructed to help you create the next great idea. More Technically Incorrect",

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money. \n\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook \nFollow John on Twitter ( @johnmatarese ) Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "text": "According to Mashable, Apple has plans for developing new AR features for iPhone camera apps. \nThese features will make it possible for your camera to recognize strangers and foreign objects through your lens — and then give you information about them. \nCreepy… or helpful? You decide. Giphy \nThe upcoming feature is similar to one provided by Blippar, an augmented reality startup. Its products recognize unknown items through a camera lens and then provide you with useful information about them. \nBlippar’s website uses an orange as an example . They claim that by pointing a camera lens at an orange while using the app, you’ll be notified with recipes, nearby grocery stores and nutritional information about the orange. \nOK… I guess that’s pretty cool. I can’t wait to point my camera at a big ol’ slice of pizza and try every restaurant that comes to my screen. \nApparently, Apple’s alleged AR developments will also include face recognition and manipulation technology similar to Snapchat. \nNews for this upcoming iPhone feature was publicized by a person familiar with the matter, who reportedly spoke with Business Insider about the plans for augmented reality in iPhone camera apps. \nIn an effort to achieve augmented reality, Apple is allegedly working with multiple AR startups. \nAccording to Business Insider, Apple also inherited a few augmented and virtual reality companies, such as Metaio and Flyby Media. \nEmployees of both companies are currently working on Apple’s camera with hopes of achieving augmented reality for Apple users. \nTaking pictures is about to get a lot more fun, so stay tuned. \nSubscribe to Elite Daily's official newsletter, The Edge , for more stories you don't want to miss.

      "text": "Apple will fix iPhone 6 Plus 'touch disease,' for $149 It says problems many owners have experienced are caused by dropping the phone. Save David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images \nA number of iPhone 6 owners and independent repair techs have been complaining for months about something called \"touch disease\" killing their phones, and now Apple is responding. The problem's symptoms have been described as a flickering gray bar across the top of the screen and problems with the touchscreen responsiveness, which continue to get worse until it's addressed or the phone is unusable. Repair techs like Jessa Jones have reported seeing multiple devices per day afflicted by the same problem, with no end in sight. \nGoing by Apple's description of its \"Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus,\" the problem is really the owner's fault, caused by \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" Still, if you have the problem and your screen isn't cracked, Apple says it will fix the issue for $149, and its repair program is available for five years after the original sale date. \nThat's less than the usual out of warranty repair price of $329 , but it's not free, and it does nothing for people who opted to replace their phone instead of fixing it. Some owners have reportedly filed lawsuits against Apple concerning the issue, and it remains to be seen how this will affect their progress. If you've already paid to have an iPhone 6 Plus repaired due to the problem, Apple says it will reimburse the difference between that cost and $149, if you used its service or an authorized technician. \nWhile some have reported similar problems with the smaller iPhone 6, there's no indication of a program for owners of that device. In a blog post on iFixit , Jones noted the larger size of the 6 Plus made it more susceptible to the problem, despite reinforcements implemented to resolve the phone's tendency to bend . The actual problem seems to come from the touch controller chip separating from the phone's logic board, which is why twisting the device can sometimes fix it for a short time.",

      "text": "Economy \n(Zero Hedge) – Donald Trump exclaimed that “we’re going to get Apple to build their damn computers and things in this country instead of in other countries,” in January, and now as Nikkei reports, Key Apple assembler Hon Hai Precision Industry, also known as Foxconn Technology Group, has been studying the possibility of moving iPhone production to America. \niPhones might one day soon carry “Made in America” labels. \n“Apple asked both Foxconn and Pegatron, the two iPhone assemblers, in June to look into making iPhones in the U.S.,” a source said. “Foxconn complied, while Pegatron declined to formulate such a plan due to cost concerns.” \nFoxconn, based in the gritty, industrial Tucheng district in suburban Taipei, and its smaller Taiwanese rival churn out more than 200 million iPhones annually from their massive Chinese campuses. \nSPECIAL: Calls for Trump’s assassination. Horrific threats to do violent harm to Melania. Obama and the liberal lunatics are not going to go quietly. They are not accepting the election results and will do ANYTHING to get their way. Will you help us stop what is coming next with a donation? \nAnother source said that while Foxconn had been working on the request from Apple Inc., its biggest customer that accounts for more than 50% of its sales, Chairman Terry Gou had been less enthusiastic due to an inevitable rise in production costs. \n“Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,” the source said. \nThe person added that one view among the Apple supply chain in Taiwan is that U.S. President-elect Donald Trump may push the Cupertino, California-based tech titan to make a certain number of iPhone components at home. \nAccording to research company IHS Markit, it costs about $225 for Apple to make an iPhone 7 with a 32GB memory, while the unsubsidized price for such a handset is $649. \nWhile it is certainly too soon to cry ‘victory’ for Trump, the mere fact that the prospect of jobs coming back to America has to be a positive one (and inflationary by the looks of it). \nhttp://www.zerohedge.com/news/2016-11-17/trump-wins-foxconn-looks-make-iphones-america President-Elect Trump May Not be Allowed to Use Oval Office for the First Year — Thanks to Obama Top Stories AMERICA GREAT AGAIN: Housing Starts Soar 25.5% To 9-Year High (Reuters) - U.S. housing starts surged to a more than nine-year high in October as builders ramped up construction of both single and multifamily home...

      "text": "I have a cool tip for everyone here:I am STUNNED that a few weeks ago Apple stopped private labelling their computer monitors.Apple is now officially out of the computer monitor reselling biz...The truth is LG has been making Apple's monitors for years...slapping Apple's logo on their private label monitors (with a few tweaks).So what does this mean for us?We now get \"Apple quality\" monitors for half price.I review products for a living...And I buy them with my own money (so no one can control my reviews)...For me, the biggest bang for the buck right now is this:LG 4K UHD 27UD88-W 27\" monitor (with USB-C)Apple used to sell this exact monitor for over $2,000.00 (it was the Apple Cinema Display).But now Amazon is selling it for under $700.Go grab it ASAP...It is like having this HUGE retina screen that connects to any desktop or laptop computer.It was designed for gamers, so the lag is almost zero.It is 4K, so the graphics are gorgeous.The text is crisp.It has every imaginable port to plug in with - including USB-C...It even doubles as a USB hug - yep, plug in a keyboard and mouse!There is one downside (but I think it is actually good)...The monitor does not include audio speakers...No problem, search for the Logitech 3.5mm Jack Compact Laptop Speakers, Black (Z130) - the best $17 external speakers I have ever reviewed.Merry (early) Christmas!",

      "text": "Apple has launched a new repair program for a widely reported on iPhone 6 Plus hardware malfunction known as “touch disease,” which renders the touchscreen useless and manifests as a thin grey line at the top the display . According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue. \n“Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,” the company writes on its website. “If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting the symptoms noted above, is in working order, and the screen is not cracked or broken, Apple will repair your device for a service price of $149.”\nApple says those who have already paid for a service repair related to the issue are eligible for reimbursement equal to the difference between the original service repair cost and the new $149 price. The company says it has begun contacting those who have already paid for such a repair, but urges customers who think they’re affected to reach out and contact Apple Technical Support to expedite the process. \n- Via: 9to5Mac - Source: Apple",

      "text": "Maintenance of a healthy weight or improved weight loss efforts Elevated energy levels during the day Increased creativity \nSleep Watch leverages the state-of-the-art motion and pulse sensors built into the Apple Watch to estimate when users are asleep by continually monitoring the heart rate and motion data provided by the Watch. Once set up, the app requires virtually no user intervention to detect sleep, aside from simply wearing the Watch to bed. Sleep Watch can also send daily sleep briefing notifications to users upon waking up in the morning. Sleep Watch also lets users automatically sync detected sleep times into the Apple Health app. \n\"We believe that digital health applications and wearables have a bright future in helping users achieve positive health outcomes. We chose to focus on sleep for a first application as it plays a critical role in our overall health including our cardiovascular health.

      "title": "iPhones Secretly Send Your Call History To Apple, A Security Firm Says",
      "text": "\nShutterstock\nApple emerged as a guardian of user privacy this year after fighting FBI demands to help crack into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone. The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption.\nBut private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances. The latest involves the company’s online syncing service iCloud.\nRussian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple’s mobile devices automatically send a user’s call history to the company’s servers if iCloud is enabled — but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification.\n“You only need to have iCloud itself enabled” for the data to be sent, said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft.\nThe logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. They also include missed and bypassed calls. Elcomsoft said Apple retains the data in a user’s iCloud account for up to four months, providing a boon to law enforcement who may not be able to obtain the data either from the user’s carrier, who may retain the data for only a short period, or from the user’s device, if it’s encrypted with an unbreakable passcode.\n“Absolutely this is an advantage [for law enforcement],” Robert Osgood, a former FBI supervisory agent who now directs a graduate program in computer forensics at George Mason University, said of Apple’s call-history uploads. “Four months is a long time [to retain call logs]. It’s generally 30 or 60 days for telecom providers, because they don’t want to keep more [records] than they absolutely have to. So if Apple is holding data for four months, that could be a very interesting data repository and they may have data that the telecom provider might not.”\nIt’s not just regular call logs that get sent to Apple’s servers. FaceTime, which is used to make audio and video calls on iOS devices, also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, according to Elcomsoft. The company believes syncing of both regular calls and FaceTime call logs goes back to at least iOS 8.2, which Apple released in March 2015.\nAnd beginning with Apple’s latest operating system, iOS 10, incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP applications like Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber, and that use Apple CallKit to make the calls, also get logged to the cloud, Katalov said.\nBecause Apple possesses the keys to unlock iCloud accounts, U.S. law enforcement agencies can obtain direct access to the logs with a court order. But they still need a tool to extract and parse it.\n\nElcomsoft said it’s releasing an update to its Phone Breaker software tool today, that can be used to extract the call histories from iCloud accounts, using the accountholder’s credentials. Elcomsoft’s forensic tools are used by law enforcement, corporate security departments, and even consumers. The company also leases some of its extraction code to Cellebrite, the Israeli firm the FBI regularly uses to get into seized phones and iCloud data.\nIn some cases Elcomsoft’s tool can help customers access the iCloud even without account credentials, if they can obtain an authentication token for the account from the accountholder’s computer, allowing them to get iCloud data without Apple’s help. The use of authentication tokens also bypasses two-factor authentication if the accountholder has set this up to prevent a hacker from getting into their account, Elcomsoft notes on its web site.\nApple’s collection of call logs potentially puts sensitive information at the disposal of people other than law enforcement and other Elcomsoft customers. Anyone else who might be able to obtain the user’s iCloud credentials, like hackers, could potentially get at it too. In 2014, more than 100 celebrities fell victim to a phishing attack that allowed a hacker to obtain their iCloud credentials and steal nude photos of them from their iCloud accounts . The perpetrator reportedly used Elcomsoft’s software to harvest the celebrity photos once the accounts were unlocked.\nGenerally, if someone were to attempt to download data in an iCloud account, the system would email a notification to the account owner. But Katalov said no notification occurs when someone downloads synced call logs from iCloud.\nApple acknowledged that the call logs are being synced and said it’s intentional.\n“We offer call history syncing as a convenience to our customers so that they can return calls from any of their devices,” an Apple spokesperson said in an email.”Device data is encrypted with a user’s passcode, and access to iCloud data including backups requires the user’s Apple ID and password. Apple recommends all customers select strong passwords and use two-factor authentication.”\nThe syncing of iCloud call logs would not be the first time Apple has been found collecting data secretly. A few months ago, The Intercept reported about similar activity occurring with iMessage logs .\nChris Soghoian, chief technologist for the American Civil Liberties Union, said he’s not surprised that Apple is collecting the information.\n“It’s arguably not even the worst thing about iCloud,” he told The Intercept. “The fact that iCloud backs up what would otherwise be end-to-end encrypted iMessages is far worse in my mind. There are other ways the government can obtain [call logs]. But without the backup of iMessages, there may be no other way for them to get those messages.”\nStill, he said it’s further proof that “iCloud really is the Achilles heel of the privacy of the iPhone platform. The two biggest privacy problems associated with iCloud don’t have check boxes [for users to opt out], nor do they require that you opt in either.”\nJonathan Zdziarski, an iOS forensics expert and security researcher, said he doesn’t think Apple is doing anything nefarious in syncing the call logs. But he said that Apple needs to be clear to users that the data is being collected and stored in the cloud.\n\nAuthorized and Unauthorized iCloud Collection iCloud is Apple’s cloud service that allows users to sync data across multiple Apple devices, including iPhones, iPads, iPods, and Macs. The iPhone menu corresponding to the service gives users the option of syncing mail, contacts, calendars, reminders, browser history and notes and wallet data. But even though call logs are automatically getting synced as well, the menu does not list them among the items users can choose to sync. Because there’s no way to opt-in to sync call logs, there is also no way to opt out — other than turning off iCloud completely, but this can cause other issues, like preventing apps from storing documents and data (such as WhatsApp backups) in the cloud.\n“You can only disable uploading/syncing notes, contacts, calendars and web history, but the calls are always there,” Katalov said. One way call logs will disappear from the cloud, is if a user deletes a particular call record from the log on their device; then it will also get deleted from their iCloud account during the next automatic synchronization.\nKatalov said they’re still researching the issue but it appears that in some cases the call logs sync almost instantly to iCloud, while other times it happens only after a few hours.\nIn addition to syncing data among their devices, users can also configure their iCloud account to automatically back up and store their data. Katalov said that call logs get sent to the cloud with these backups as well, but this is separate from the trafficking his company discovered: Even if users disable the backups, their call logs will still get synced to Apple’s servers.\n“I would suggest Apple to add a simple option to disable call log syncing, as they do that for calendars and other things,” Katalov told The Intercept, though he acknowledges this would likely take some re-architecting on Apple’s part. Nonetheless, he says “they should allow people to disable that if they want to.”\nEven as Apple has increased the security of its mobile devices in recent years, the company has been moving more and more data to the cloud, where it is less protected. Although iCloud data is encrypted on Apple’s server, Apple retains the encryption keys in almost every instance and can therefore unlock the accounts and access data for its own purposes or for law enforcement.\n“All of your [iCloud] data is encrypted with keys that are controlled by Apple, but the average user isn’t going to understand that,” Zdziarski said. “You and I are well aware that Apple can read any of your iCloud data when they want to.”\nA report in the Financial Times nine months ago indicated Apple plans to re-architect iCloud to resolve this issue and better protect customer data, but that has yet to occur.\nApple discusses the privacy implications of iCloud collection on its website, and does say that implementing backups will send to iCloud “nearly all data and settings stored on your device.” A 63-page white paper on the site discloses more clearly that call logs get uploaded to Apple servers when iCloud backups are enabled. But neither document mentions that the logs still get uploaded even if backups aren’t enabled.\nEven law enforcement seems to be in the dark about the availability of these logs, especially logs going back four months. Osgood told The Intercept he was not aware of them. And in an online document about handling legal requests from law enforcement , Apple never mentions that call logs are available through iCloud. It says that it possesses subscriber information that customers provide, including name, physical address, email address, and telephone number. It also says it retains IP connection logs (for up to 30 days), email metadata (for up to 60 days), and content that the user chooses to upload, such as photos, email, documents, contacts, calendars, and bookmarks. The law enforcement document also says that Apple’s servers have iOS device backups, which may include photos and videos in the user’s camera roll, device settings, application data, iMessages, SMS and MMS messages and voicemail.\nThe only time it mentions call logs is to say that iCloud stores call histories associated with FaceTime, but it says it maintains only FaceTime call invitation logs, which indicate when a subscriber has sent an invitation to someone to participate in a FaceTime call. Apple says the logs “do not indicate that any communication between users actually took place.” It also says it only retains these logs for “up to 30 days.”\nBut Elcomsoft said this is not true. Katalov said the FaceTime logs contain full information about the call, including the identification of both parties to the call and the call duration. He said his researchers also found that the FaceTime call logs were retained for as long as four months.\n\nEarly Clues from Frustrated Apple Customers Some users are aware that their call logs are being synced to Apple’s servers, because a by-product of the automatic syncing means that if they have the same Apple ID as someone with a different device — for example spouses who have different phones but use the same Apple ID — they will see calls from one device getting synced automatically to the device of the other person who is using the same ID.\n“Its very irritating,” one user complained in a forum about the issue. “My wife and I both have iPhones, we are both on the same apple ID. When she gets a call my phone doesn’t ring but when she misses that call my phone shows a missed call icon on the phone app and when I go to the phone app its pretty clearly someone who wasn’t calling my phone. Any way to fix this so it stops?”\nAnother user expressed frustration at not knowing how to stop the syncing . “I use my phone for business and we have noticed in the last few days that all of the calls I make and receive are appearing in my wife’s iPhone recent call history? I have hunted high and low in settings on both phones but with no joy.”\nThere’s no indication, however, that these customers realized the full implications of their logs being synced — that the same data is being sent to and stored on Apple’s servers for months.\nApple isn’t the only company syncing call logs to the cloud. Android phones do it as well, and Windows 10 mobile devices also sync call logs by default with other Windows 10 devices that use the same Microsoft Account. Katalov said there are too many Android smartphone versions to test but his company’s research indicates that call log syncing occurs only with Android 6.x and newer versions. As with Apple devices, the only way for a user to disable the call history syncing is to disable syncing completely.\n“In ‘pure’ [stock versions of] Android such as one installed on Nexus and Pixel devices, there is no way to select categories to sync,” Katalov said. “For some reason, that is only able on some third-party Android versions running on Sony, HTC, Samsung etc.” The company already produces a tool for harvesting call logs associated with Android devices .\nThere’s little that subscribers can do to prevent law enforcement from obtaining their iCloud call logs. But to protect against a hacker who might obtain your AppleID from doing the same, they can use two-factor authentication. But Zdziarski said there’s another solution.\n“The takeaway really is don’t ever use iCloud. I won’t use it myself until I can be in control of the encryption keys,” he said.\nThe post iPhones Secretly Send Call History To Apple, Security Firm Says appeared first on The Intercept .\n",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Wall Street pays close attention to the quarterly 13F reports from hedge funds, scruitanizing — an sometime copying — the portfolio moves of titans like Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb .\nGetty Images What do we learn if we look at the third wquarter buying and selling among the top 50 hedge funds? According to FactSet Research , hedge funds grew more bullish on stocks , expanding their exposure to equities by 2.9% during Q3. That’s a marked turnaround from Q2 when equity exposure dropped 1.3%.\nWhere did all this buying take place? According to the FactSet report, hedge funds bought $12.2 billion worth of stock in the consumer staples sector, including $8.9 billion in share of P&G ( PG ). In fact, P&G was the top hedge fund purchase of Q3.\nFactSet went into more detail\nMillennium Management was the primary driver of the inflows into these two stocks. It is interesting to note that Procter & Gamble became the fourth largest holding in the top 50 hedge fund portfolio, yet the stock was only held by 11 funds at the end of Q3. P&G’s stock is up 5.3% year-to-date, while Coty’s stock is down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nApple ( AAPL ) was the second-largest hedge fund purchase, a big switch from Q2 when it was t he biggest sale.

      "text": "iPhones Secretly Send Call History to Apple, Security Firm Says Apple emerged as a guardian of user privacy this year after fighting FBI demands to help crack into San Bernardino shooter Syed Rizwan Farook’s iPhone. The company has gone to great lengths to secure customer data in recent years, by implementing better encryption for all phones and refusing to undermine that encryption. \nBut private information still escapes from Apple products under some circumstances. The latest involves the company’s online syncing service iCloud. \nRussian digital forensics firm Elcomsoft has found that Apple’s mobile devices automatically send a user’s call history to the company’s servers if iCloud is enabled — but the data gets uploaded in many instances without user choice or notification. \n“You only need to have iCloud itself enabled” for the data to be sent, said Vladimir Katalov, CEO of Elcomsoft. \nThe logs surreptitiously uploaded to Apple contain a list of all calls made and received on an iOS device, complete with phone numbers, dates and times, and duration. They also include missed and bypassed calls. Elcomsoft said Apple retains the data in a user’s iCloud account for up to four months, providing a boon to law enforcement who may not be able to obtain the data either from the user’s phone, if it’s encrypted with an unbreakable passcode, or from the carrier. Although large carriers in the U.S. retain call logs for a year or more, this may not be the case with carrier outside the US. \nIt’s not just regular call logs that get sent to Apple’s servers. FaceTime, which is used to make audio and video calls on iOS devices, also syncs call history to iCloud automatically, according to Elcomsoft. The company believes syncing of both regular calls and FaceTime call logs goes back to at least iOS 8.2, which Apple released in March 2015. \nAnd beginning with Apple’s latest operating system, iOS 10, incoming missed calls that are made through third-party VoIP applications like Skype, WhatsApp, and Viber, and that use Apple CallKit to make the calls, also get logged to the cloud, Katalov said. \nBecause Apple possesses the keys to unlock iCloud accounts, U.S. law enforcement agencies can obtain direct access to the logs with a court order. But they still need a tool to extract and parse it. \nElcomsoft said it’s releasing an update to its Phone Breaker software tool today that can be used to extract the call histories from iCloud accounts, using the account holder’s credentials. Elcomsoft’s forensic tools are used by law enforcement, corporate security departments, and even consumers. The company also leases some of its extraction code to Cellebrite, the Israeli firm the FBI regularly uses to get into seized phones and iCloud data. ...",

      "title": "Apple Launches 'Touch Disease' Repair Program For iPhone 6 Plus",
      "text": "  @07:50PM from the day-late-and-a-dollar-short dept. Apple has ignored one of the biggest problems plaguing iPhone 6 Plus devices -- until now. The company today launched a new \"Touch Disease\" repair program for the iPhone 6 Plus , finally addressing complaints about a hardware defect that causes the display of the devices to become unresponsive to touch, or less responsive overall. If you have an iPhone 6 Plus that is affected by this defect, you will be able to have your device fixed for a service price of $149. You will be reimbursed by Apple if you paid more than $149 to have your device fixed before the repair program was implemented. MacRumors provides some extra details: Complaints about the iPhone 6 Plus touchscreen issue started in August, after iFixit published a video highlighting the bug and dubbed it \"Touch Disease .\" Touch Disease presents as a gray flickering bar at the top of the screen and a display that becomes unresponsive or less responsive to touch. The problem is believed to be caused by the touchscreen controller chips soldered to the logic board of the phone, making repairs difficult. Third-party repair outlets speculated that the issue could be linked to the same structural design flaw that caused the major \"Bendgate\" controversy, and Apple's suggestion that it is caused by repeated physical damage seems to confirm that. Customers who have an iPhone 6 Plus with Multi-Touch issues can visit an Apple Authorized Service Provider or an Apple retail store to see if they qualify for the $149 repair fee.",

      "title": "The real reason Apple produces outside the US has little to do with labor costs",
      "text": "“Designed in California,” and soon to be made there as well?\nApple has asked two of its major product assemblers, Foxconn and Pegatron, to explore the possibility of manufacturing future iPhones in the US, Nikkei reported Thursday, Nov. 17 (Friday morning in Japan).\nThe report suggests that Apple has asked both companies to look into how feasible it would be to produce the number of iPhones they currently do—roughly 200 million a year—in the US rather than Asia. Pegatron turned down the request, citing concerns around how much it would cost, while Foxconn looked into it, according Nikkei. “Making iPhones in the U.S. means the cost will more than double,” the unnamed source told Nikkei. Apple wasn’t immediately available to comment on the report.\nApple’s impetus for potentially moving production of its most popular product to the US is reportedly due to concerns that president-elect Donald Trump may attempt to force the company to produce at least part of the iPhone domestically. Trump criticized Apple multiple times during his campaign, including its stance on refusing the FBI’s demand to unlock the San Bernardino shooter’s phone, and suggesting that the company should build the iPhone in the US.\nProduction costs would likely skyrocket were Apple to build its next generations of the iPhone in the US, but it wouldn’t really be because labor would cost so much more there. One of the benefits of Western companies manufacturing goods in Asia is that labor costs are indeed far lower than what they are at home. But as Jason Dedrick, a professor at the School of Information Studies at Syracuse University, told The Wall Street Journal , if Apple could find enough workers in one place to assemble massive amounts of iPhones in the US, the cost per iPhone would likely increase by about $30 or $40 (a new iPhone starts at $649 in the US), and only a small part of that would be due to labor.\nThe real issue is that the vast majority of Apple’s suppliers, the companies that build the individual components that make up an iPhone—such as the battery, the camera, the display, the sensors, and just about every other part inside the iPhone—are based in Asia.\nApple has suppliers in 28 countries, and the countries with the highest concentration of suppliers are China, Japan, the US, and Taiwan, according to MIT Technology Review . Shipping all of those individual parts to the US would cost a lot more than moving them around China or shipping them across Asia.\nDedrick estimated for The Wall Street Journal that making all the iPhone components in the US could see the cost of an iPhone rise by $90. And that’s assuming Apple would be able to source all of the same components in the US. Apple has been working with manufacturers and suppliers for decades, and almost 10 years on the iPhone alone, and replacing those relationships would not necessarily be easy. The company also uses manufacturers like Foxconn to help prototype products, so the research and development costs of finding new partners (or doing more work in-house) would also likely increase.",

      "text": "Reddit \nSeemingly neglected with the latest round of Mac refreshes are Apple’s desktop offerings. While the MacBook Pro was dramatically overhauled this year with a new design, faster internals, an all-new Touch Bar, and more, the desktop offerings, specifically the Mac mini and Mac Pro, were left untouched. \nIn fact, while the iMacs were last updated a little over a year ago, it has been since 2014 when the Mac mini saw even a speed bump and you have to go back over 1000 days to 2013 when the Mac Pro was updated with Apple VP of Marketing Phil Schiller rather ironically saying “can’t innovate anymore my ass.” \nApple’s inattention in this area has left many to question whether or not either standalone Mac has a future or if Apple could push the less lucrative desktop business into the hands of another company. Doing so could keep Apple’s customers happy and offer significant time and monetary incentives for Apple… \nApple dramatically overhauled the Mac Pro back in 2013 with an all-new cylindrical design. The design is significantly smaller than the previous tower-esque Mac Pro, giving it a much smaller footprint. Apple also, of course, notably improved the speed capabilities of the Mac Pro with the 2013 refresh. But the updated design made it more difficult for users to perform their own upgrades after purchasing the machine. \nAs CPUs and GPUs have gotten faster since 2013, Mac Pro users have been left behind. Almost a year ago, Oculus founder Palmer Luckey said : \nIt boils down to the fact that Apple doesn’t prioritize high-end GPUs. You can a buy $6,000 Mac Pro with the top of the line AMD FirePro D700 and it still doesn’t meet our recommended spec. If they prioritize higher-end GPUs like they used to for awhile back in the day, I think we’d love to support Mac. \nSince 2013, the Mac Pro has not been touched by Apple. There haven’t been any spec bumps, design tweaks, or port changes since then. In fact, the Mac Pro still features four outdated USB-A ports and 6 Thunderbolt 2 ports, technologies that Apple is quickly moving away from on their laptops, as evident by the new MacBook and MacBook Pro . \nIt’s much of the same with the Mac mini. That machine was first released in 2005, and eventually morphed into the small aluminum square that we have today. The point is that for years Apple kept the Mac mini up to date, with yearly design refreshes, and/or spec upgrades. \nIn fact, both machines had been updated almost every year prior to Tim Cook taking over Apple in 2011. After Cook’s takeover, Mac mini/Pro updates all but stopped. It’s impossible to know if these things are related but it is certainly notable. \nThe Mac mini was last updated in 2014 with an under-the-hood spec bump to bring it up to date with Intel’s Haswell processors. The last dramatic design update to the Mac mini came in 2010 with the switch to a unibody aluminum design, meaning the Mac mini has been largely the same in terms of design for 6 years now. \nWith the Mac Pro and Mac mini both lagging significantly behind in terms of upgrades, I’m really starting to question Apple’s commitment to the Mac desktop market. Apple didn’t mention either device at its Mac-focused event last month , and that’s just the continuation of a trend that has been ongoing for years now. \nApple’s inattention to the Mac Pro and Mac mini comes at a time when PC manufacturers are pushing forward with machines similar to the ones Apple pioneered. For instance, just yesterday HP introduced its new Z2 Mini (Above), which if you’ve ever seen a Mac mini and imagine it morphed with a Mac Pro, should look very familiar. The Z2 Mini comes starts at $699 and significantly out-powers the most recent Mac mini by a long shot. In fact, with the latest Xeon processors and NVIDIA Quadro Pro Graphics, I’m pretty sure it could give the 3-year-old Mac Pro a run for its money. \nFurther proving its lack of interest in desktop machines is Apple’s move to seemingly outsource its display business to LG. Alongside the new MacBook Pros, Apple announced that it had worked with LG on new UltraFine 4K and 5K standalone monitors, just months after the (very outdated) Thunderbolt Display was discontinued and it remarked that it was out of the display business. How is Apple going to market standalone Mac models without offering a first-party display to go along with them? While LG’s displays appear to be very good, Apple/Mac purists aren’t in love with the black plastic matte bezels, and quite frankly, the lack of an Apple logo. \nFurthermore, Apple’s own marketing seems to suggest that it designed the new MacBook Pro as a machine that can be used both on-the-go and at a desk. During the unveil event, Apple showed the above image while touting the capabilities of Thunderbolt 3 and USB-C. The image shows a MacBook Pro powering an entire desk setup, including two monitors and a variety of other equipment. Apple’s logic here seems to be, “Why should a person have two different machines for desk and on-the-go work when one can do both?” \nIt’s clear that Apple’s interest in the desktop market is waning. And given the company’s focus on lucrative, mass markets, it makes sense that the Mac mini and Mac Pro wouldn’t be a top priority. There are, however, ways that Apple can continue to please desktop users while also focusing on other products. \nOne possibility here would be for Apple to set macOS free and license it to be installed on the hardware from other companies. Apple could work closely with the companies to ensure that everything is up to par, but this still seems like a long shot. Apple of course ran a clone program as its fortunes waned in the 90s at the hands of Microsoft. After fighting off fakes for years, the company launched an official clone program for Mac OS that saw it license the operating system to other manufacturers in order to help it penetrate the market at a faster rate. Mostly, clones just cannibalized Apple sales and undercut its pricing. One of the 1st things Steve Jobs did when he came back to Apple was kill off the clone licensing program. \nBut Apple doesn’t seem care about its waning desktop Mac numbers (or so it would seem). If Apple could create a lock in system on its own terms, it could stand to make a lot of money with very little effort (even less than it is exerting now). \nWhen you think about it, there’s very little Apple-exclusive hardware in a Mac. Apple’s newest Macs feature the Apple T1 chip for Touch ID and Touch Bar, but everything else is pretty much off the shelf PC product purchased from other companies: RAM/SSDs from Samsung, GPUs from Nvidia/AMD and of course processors from Intel. As for the Touch Bar, Apple could sell a standalone Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar, as we’ve suggested in the past . This would allow for Apple to still have control Touch ID and the secure enclave which gives access to the Mac identity whether it is stored in the cloud or on an encrypted local SSD. \nSo picture this: a pair of desktop-oriented Macs, manufactured by a third-party, with licensed macOS running on them and a standalone Magic Keyboard with Touch Bar sold by Apple. This would allow for Apple to focus its attention on its other products and continuing to innovate in new categories, as well. \nEven if this doesn’t come to fruition– and let’s be honest, it’s a long shot – it’s becoming more and more apparent that Apple is shifting its focus from the desktop to the laptop, iPad, iPhone, and Apple Watch. With the company’s product lineup becoming more personal (whether or not that’s a good thing is an entirely different argument), less commercially popular devices like the Mac mini and Mac Pro are seemingly being ignored. And Apple seems to have no regrets about that. \nIt’s been 1,064 days since the Mac Pro was upgraded and 763 days since the Mac mini was upgraded…and counting and no other products are expected until 2017. As a comparison, Apple last updated the iPod Classic in 2009 and discontinued it 5 years later in 2014 after it couldn’t get any more parts. \nWhat do you think about Apple’s commitment to the desktop market?

      "title": "Apple will fix iPhone 6 Pluses with touchscreen problems, but it will cost you",
      "text": "If you've been having touchscreen problems with your iPhone 6 Plus, Apple has a fix for you if you're willing to pay for it. The \" iPhone 6 Plus Multi-Touch Repair Program \" is for phones that are either having trouble registering touchscreen input or that are have flickering displays as a result of \"being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\"\nUnlike past iPhone repair programs—a list which includes the power button and battery in the iPhone 5 and the camera in the iPhone 6 Plus —Apple is charging a $149 service fee to replace iPhones affected by the problem. Even then, Apple says your phone needs to be \"in working order\" and can't have a cracked or broken screen. If you have previously paid for a repair related to these problems, Apple says that you can contact the company to be reimbursed for whatever you paid beyond $149.\nBased on Apple's description of the problem, it sounds like this could be a fix for a problem that iFixit and independent iPhone repair shops brought to light a few months ago . Colorfully dubbed \"Touch Disease,\" iFixit says that the problem is caused by touchscreen controller chips that can come loose from the logic board. The controllers in question were moved from the logic board into the display assembly in the iPhone 6S, which iFixit speculates is the reason why later variants of the iPhone 6 design aren't susceptible to the same problem.\nWe've asked Apple whether this program is intended to fix the symptoms of \"Touch Disease,\" and why the repair program includes a service fee when past repair programs have fixed problems free of charge. We'll update the article if we receive a response.",

      "text": "Apple has launched a new repair program for a widely reported on iPhone 6 Plus hardware malfunction known as “touch disease,” which renders the touchscreen useless and manifests as a thin grey line at the top the display. According to Apple, however, this flaw is caused by dropping the phone repeatedly. The company says it will not cover the cost of a repair and will ask those affected by the issue to pay $149 to have it fixed. That might not sit too well with the iPhone owners who filed class action lawsuits against Apple over the touch disease issue.\n\n“Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further...",

      "text": "  14:50 PM EST Benevity is Excited to Support the Launch of Apple Pay for Nonprofits \nSOURCE: Benevity DESCRIPTION: \nThis is a big week. One of the most prodigious companies in the world, Apple, announced the ability for charities to receive donations via Apple Pay. And we’re pretty excited to play a role by enabling charities from the Benevity Causes Portal to gain access to this new way to donate that’s fast and convenient. \nWhy does this matter? Because it’s further proof of the growing trend of corporations using their wealth and resources to enable more social good. More specifically, at Benevity we are seeing technology used to evolve outdated ways of giving while providing charities with a more efficient way of receiving much-needed funds.",

      "title": "iPhone 8 Rumors: Only One Model Could Sport OLED Display Next Year",
      "text": "11/17/16 AT 8:53 PM Close \nNext year will be the iPhone’s 10th anniversary and Apple is expected to bring in some major changes to its infamous smartphone. One of the biggest changes that the tech giant wants to make is replacing the iPhone’s LED display with OLED, but it looks like there’s a problem. \nThe four main suppliers of OLED displays don’t have enough production capacity to make displays for Apple’s next iPhones in 2017, people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg . The constraints on the production of OLED displays are also expected to continue through 2018. \nOLED display technology is already being used by most of Apple’s rivals and are considered to be better than LCDs in terms of picture quality and power consumption. OLED displays are also a lot more difficult to make which is why manufacturers are having trouble with mass production. \nThe four largest suppliers of OLED displays are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp Corp., and Japan Display. LG is busy making OLED displays for its TVs, while Sharp and Japan Display are still working on development and manufacturing. Samsung Display appears to be the only supplier that Apple can count on. \nThe problem now is that Samsung Display may not be able to keep up with Apple’s demands. Apple has already ordered for 100 million units to ship for the 2017 holiday season. Samsung Display won’t even be able to produce half of what Apple wants, according to MacWorld. Related Stories iPhone 8 Will Reportedly Come in Different Sizes, LCD And OLED Models \nBecause of this, it now looks like Apple will be forced to only use OLED displays on one version of the iPhone 8 next year. Earlier this week, IBT reported that analyst Ming-chi Kuo predicts that Apple might possibly introduce three iPhone models in 2017; a 4.7-inch model with an LCD display, a 5.5-inch Plus model with an LCD display and another model equipped with an OLED display. \nKuo didn’t specify the screen size of the OLED iPhone 8 at the time, but he did come out with a second report claiming that it might be 5.8 inches diagonally but only 5.1-5.2 inches of the display will be active. This is because the OLED iPhone 8 will come with a curved screen with the edges of the display being inactive. \nThe OLED-equipped iPhone 8 will apparently be the top-tier model and it will have the most different look out of the three. The OLED iPhone 8 will have an all-glass design with the glass on top of the display wrapping the handset’s edges and back. \nThe physical home button will also be replaced by a virtual home button embedded within the display itself. The 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus and the OLED iPhone 8 will also be the only models to come with a dual-camera setup.

      "title": "Want to Cure Your iPhone's Touch Disease? Pay Apple $149",
      "text": "If your iPhone 6 Plus suffers from a flickering screen that's become unresponsive to your touch, Apple has a fix for you. But it'll cost you $149.\n\nApple today (Nov. 17) launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus models that have flickering displays or problems registering multi-touch inputs. If your phone is otherwise in working order without a cracked or broken screen, Apple says it will repair affect iPhone 6 Pluses for $149.\n\nThis iFixit image shows the gray flicker that's a sympton of Touch Disease. The problem with flickering screens has been a source of internet speculation for some time now. Back in August, iFixit reported that it was seeing a rise in the number of iPhone 6 and 6 Plus devices suffering from a gray flicker at the top of the display and an unresponsive tuouchscreen. \nMORE: 23 Essential iPhone 7 Tips and Tricks \nAt the time, iFixit blamed what it called the \"Touch Disease\" problem on pair of touchscreen controller chips found on the logic board of the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus. As you may recall, those models were prone to bending, and iPhone repair specialists suggested that the added stress on the logic board was causing problems with the affected sensors.\n\nApple, it seems, does not entirely agree with that diagnosis. In its notice announcing the Multi-Touch repair program, the company said the iPhone 6 Plus might exhibit these problems \"after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.\" In other words, Apple thinks wear-and-tear is the culprit and not a design flaw, which is probably why you'll have to pay that $149 repair cost.\n\nThe repair program only covers the iPhone 6 Plus, though some users have reported problems with the smaller iPhone 6 as well. (In its August report on the problem, iFixit said the problem occured more frequently in Plus models, since it was more prone to bending.)\n\nIf you already paid to have your iPhone 6 Plus fixed, Apple says it will reimburse you for any costs you incurred above $149. Apple says affected iPhone 6 Plus owners should contact an authorized Apple service provider or go to the Apple Store for the repair.\n\nThree iPhone owners filed a class-action suit against Apple over their phone's touchscreens in August.\nSee Also : Worst Gadget Recalls of All Time \nHere Are the 10 Best Smartphones Available Upgrading to the iPhone 7?

Subscribers to the television streaming service can now use it to watch shows on Apple’s device provided they have a fourth generation Apple TV. They just have to download the app from the App Store and login to their account. \nHere are the specifics, courtesy of the PlayStation Blog: \nStarting today, PlayStation Vue will be supported on Apple TV (4th generation), leveraging Apple TV’s latest hardware to create an innovative experience. You will be able to take advantage of Apple TV’s Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue’s sleek look and feel. PlayStation Vue brings popular programming to Apple TV, from live sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network, to premium channels like AMC, FX, HBO, and Showtime. \nIf you already have an existing PlayStation Vue account, you can link your subscription to Apple TV and start streaming right away. If you’re new to PlayStation Vue, you can sign up for one of several plan options through the PlayStation Vue website and link your account to Apple TV, without the need of a PlayStation console. Plans start at $29.99, or $39.99 in select cities, so head over to our website and enter your zip code to see the plans available in your area. \nBy all accounts, PlayStation Vue is a solid service for anyone considering cutting the cord, so it’s great to see that people can now use it in conjunction with their Apple TV. This is all part of Sony’s plans to make the streaming service more wildly available, and this is certainly a step in the right direction. \nAre any of our readers using PlayStation Vue?

      "text": "– A + Apple activates iPhone 6 Plus repair program to address 'touch disease' By Mikey Campbell \nThursday, November 17, 2016, 03:21 pm PT (06:21 pm ET) \nIn what appears to be a response to the so-called \"touch disease\" problem, Apple on Thursday initiated a special program to repair iPhone 6 Plus devices exhibiting screen flicker issues due to multiple drops on a hard surface. \n\n\n\n\nDubbed the multi-touch repair program for iPhone 6 Plus, Apple's new repair initiative allows customers affected by a rare screen flicker issue to fix their faulty unit for a flat $149 service fee. The company failed to detail which component or components are causing the ongoing issues, but intimated users are partially at fault. \n\n\"Apple has determined that some iPhone 6 Plus devices may exhibit display flickering or Multi-Touch issues after being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device,\" the company said.\n\nReferred to as \"touch disease,\" the problem presents as a thin grey flickering band located toward the top of an affected iPhone 6 or 6 Plus display. In extreme cases, the band progressively extends further down the screen, ultimately impacting touch response. \n\nFollowing user complaints in August, AppleInsider discovered the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus malady accounted for roughly 11 percent of an Apple store's daily iPhone service volume. At the time, sources said the issue was related to iPhone's touch controller. \n\nSpecifically, some units were affected by the degradation of solder joints connecting the touch controller chip to the logic board, while others saw the chip simply fail. Both scenarios could logically be tied to multiple drops on a hard surface, as Apple claims.\n\nUsers who believe their iPhone 6 Plus is experiencing the multi-touch problem described above should contact Apple or take their phone in to an Apple retail store or Apple Authorized Service Provider for inspection. \n\nAs part of the new program, Apple is reaching out to reimburse iPhone 6 Plus owners sought repairs related to the multi-touch issue through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider. Customers who paid for repairs and have not yet been contacted can send a request for reimbursement directly to Apple .",

      "title": "Apple wants OLED in iPhones, but most suppliers aren’t ready",
      "text": "Apple has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that's already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers.\nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the company.\nOLED (organic light-emitting diode) screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display, LG Display, Sharp and Japan Display.\nWhile Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand.\nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags.\n\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple's stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said.\nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won't be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple's first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone's first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options.\nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple's plans.\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment.\nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they're unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice.\nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations.\n\"There is all this talk about OLEDs, but I'm not at all sure about their future,\" Sharp president Tai Jeng Wu told reporters recently. \"We need to work on developing the technology, but whether we can succeed remains to be seen.\"\nBloomberg",

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money. \n\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook \nFollow John on Twitter ( @johnmatarese ) Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "text": "We’ve introduced several new features and capabilities to our popular Garmin Pilot app for Apple mobile devices including integrated weight and balance calculations, as well as aircraft performance tables and calculations and more. Also new to Garmin Pilot, Freehand flight planning allows for quick and easy flight plan editing from the moving map page. Pilot-configurable checklists are also integrated within Garmin Pilot, providing pilots the option to create custom checklists that are accessible within the app. These new features and more are available as a free update for existing customers and provide pilots with even more tools to aid in flight planning and in-flight navigation all within a single mobile application.\nIntegrated weight & balance \nGarmin Pilot is the first application that incorporates weight and balance calculations into a flight plan or a saved trip, taking into account fuel burn and more for a comprehensive look at weight and balance characteristics throughout an entire flight. Pilots can take advantage of pre-loaded aircraft types or enter aircraft weight and balance figures manually, noting the arm, moment and station of each point from the Pilot’s Operating Handbook. Figures such as center of gravity are easily referenced in the application relative to an active flight plan. Pilots also receive a visual alert in the event CG limits are exceeded within the app. For a video tutorial, click here .\nWeight & Balance feature within Garmin Pilot.\nEnhanced performance calculation \nNew performance tables conveniently calculate take-off, climb, cruise and decent profiles so pilots can easily reference performance characteristics specific to their aircraft within Garmin Pilot. Pilots are provided with an interactive and graphically-rich interface to input figures that calculate aircraft performance, including variables such as time, power setting, fuel and distance to climb and cruise. All aircraft performance calculations take into account pertinent factors such as outside air temperature and altitude. Several of the most popular fixed-wing aircraft models among Garmin Pilot users are also pre-populated within the app. Additional aircraft types will be added to the aircraft library in upcoming releases. For a video tutorial, click here .\nPerformance feature within Garmin Pilot.\nAdditional flyGarmin integration \nEnhanced flyGarmin integration provides customers with more opportunities to easily customize and save data within the Garmin Pilot app. Pilots now have the option to input and save their own aircraft performance characteristics manually within the the flyGarmin website, which can be shared across individualized aircraft profiles with other pilots across different accounts. Weight and balance reports can also be maintained within flyGarmin, so it’s easy to save, print or email aircraft weight and balance reports and CG data for every flight. Customized checklists can also be created within flyGarmin and synced to the Garmin Pilot app on a mobile device.\nFreehand \nWith a single tap pilots can utilize new Freehand flight plan editing, which can be quickly accessed via the radial menu within Garmin Pilot. Freehand allows pilots to easily plan or fly around weather, airspace, terrain or other pertinent features without leaving the moving map. Simply access Freehand by long pressing over an active flight plan route on the map. By selecting the graphically edit icon within the radial menu, pilots can either tap individual waypoints or utilize Freehand mode to dynamically draw a route, which uses a combination of NavAids, intersections and airports to generate a new flight plan with a simple finger swipe across the map. For a video tutorial, click here .\nFreehand feature within Garmin Pilot.\nCustomized Checklists \nChecklists can now easily be created and displayed within the Garmin Pilot app. Similar to an aircraft POH, these checklists can be categorized by normal, abnormal and emergency and then sorted even further by phase of flight, such as preflight, before take-off and before landing. Customized checklists are interactive, allowing pilots to select each individual checklist item. When selected, the checklist item turns green and a green checkmark confirms the step has been completed. For a video tutorial, click here .\nChecklist feature within Garmin Pilot.\nAdditional features \nPilots can easily import multiple user-defined waypoints into Garmin Pilot using a CSV file format from a computer. Flight plans can now be created online using AOPA’s Flight Planner and SkyVector on a computer and sent to Garmin Pilot on a mobile device. Pilots can configure home screen icons to suit their flight planning preferences. Garmin Pilot 8.5 for Apple mobile devices is available immediately as a free update, providing existing customers access to these latest features. For new customers, Garmin Pilot is available in the Apple App Store as a free download for the first 30 days. After the 30-day trial period, customers may purchase an annual subscription of Garmin Pilot for the U.S. starting at $74.99.

      "text": "AFP | November 18, 2016 Gartner's survey confirmed other reports showing Samsung and Apple at the top of the global market but with slipping sales. \nWASHINGTON: Chinese manufacturers are driving growth in the smartphone market as sector leaders Samsung and Apple sputter, a survey showed Thursday. \nThe survey by Gartner Inc. showed that in the third quarter, three Chinese vendors — Huawei, Oppo and BBK Communication Equipment — together accounted for 21 percent of the smartphones sold worldwide, and were the only vendors in the top five to increase sales. \n“Sales of smartphones in China grew by 12.4 percent, and the vendors who most successfully exploited the sales opportunities there were Oppo and BBK,” said Gartner analyst Anshul Gupta. \n“In Oppo’s case, 81 percent of its smartphone sales came from China, while BBK accounted for 89 percent of smartphones sales in China. These two vendors also grew strongly in India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and Russia.” \nGartner’s survey confirmed other reports showing Samsung and Apple at the top of the global market but with slipping sales. \nThe research firm said Samsung’s market share dropped to 19.2 percent amid the fiasco over its Galaxy Note 7 smartphones, which were recalled and then halted after overheating batteries leading to fires. \n“The decision to withdraw the Galaxy Note 7 was correct, but the damage to Samsung’s brand will make it harder for the company to increase its smartphone sales in the short term,” said Gupta. \n“For Samsung, it’s crucial that the Galaxy S8 launches successfully, so that partners and customers regain trust in its brand.” \nApple’s share dropped to 11.5 percent as the iPhone maker failed to get much benefit from Samsung’s woes, Gartner said. \n“The withdrawal of Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7 may benefit sales of Apple’s iPhone 7 Plus only slightly, as Note 7 users are likely to stay with Samsung or at least with Android,” said Gartner’s Roberta Cozza. \n“To some extent, other Android vendors could capitalize on this situation in the short term — for example, Huawei and other Chinese brands present in the premium Android phone segment.” \nCozza said the Samsung problems could also benefit Google, which recently introduced its Pixel and Pixel XL devices. \nGartner said overall smartphone sales in the quarter rose 5.4 percent to 373 million units.",

      "text": "For months a number of iPhone 6 Plus owners have experienced the dreaded “ touch disease ,” a flickering gray bar on the device’s screen, which eventually renders the device unresponsive to touch. \nDespite facing class action lawsuits in response to the problem, Apple Inc. had not publicly acknowledged the problem and affected users would only benefit from a free repair if they were still under warranty or had AppleCare. \nApple has now announced that it will offer a reduced repair cost for iPhone 6 Plus devices affected by “touch disease.” \nYou, not Apple, are responsible “Touch disease” stems from a flawed controller chip soldered to the logic board with additional rumors pointing towards it being the same design flaw that caused the “bendgate” controversy. \nWhile many third-party repairers agree that “touch disease” is due to a design flaw , Apple don’t agree. According to the description given on Apple’s “ Multi-Touch Repair Program for iPhone 6 Plus ” page, the problem is due to the device “being dropped multiple times on a hard surface and then incurring further stress on the device.” \nDespite some iPhone 6 users also experiencing the same telltale signs of “touch disease,” Apple are only offering reduced repair costs for iPhone 6 Plus users. \nRepair process: conditions, cost, service options If your iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting “touch disease” symptoms, is in working order and your device’s screen isn’t cracked or broken you will be eligible for an Apple repair at a reduced cost. \nNote: The first visible thing that you will notice with “touch disease” is a flickering gray bar displayed at the top of your iPhone’s screen. Over time the iPhone’s touchscreen will start to lose functionality and intermittently become unresponsive. \nWhile Apple has reduced the repair cost by more than half, iPhone 6 Plus users will still need to fork over $149 . An out of warranty repair cost is normally $329. \nYou can get your iPhone 6 Plus fixed for $149 by taking it to an Apple Authorized Service Provider in your area or you can make an appointment at an Apple Retail Store . Alternatively, contact Apple Support with any additional questions. Prior to fixing your iPhone 6 Plus, Apple will examine it to make sure it is in working order and is actually affected by “touch disease.” \nNote: Before you take your iPhone 6 Plus in for repair, make sure you make a backup of all your data via iCloud or iTunes . \nGet a reimbursement for “touch disease” repair costs Since this issue has been going on since August you may have already paid the full repair costs to get your iPhone 6 Plus repaired. \nIf this is the case, Apple will reimburse you the difference between the original repair cost and the reduced $149 repair cost . You will only be eligible for the reimbursement if you went through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider . \nApple will contact relevant customers who are due a reimbursement, alternatively, you can contact the company if you don’t hear from them and feel you are eligible. \nImage via Kārlis Dambrāns; Flickr ",

Putting it politely, Apple replaced useful \"legacy\" ports like USB and HDMI with nothing but USB-C/Thunderbolt 3. Furthermore, prices went way up, upgradeability was stripped out, and RAM is capped at 16 GB. To make matters more tricky, Apple squished its previously great keyboards to within .5 mm of not moving at all. It's not all bad news, but it's easy to see how the shortcomings and omitted features have the Mac faithful feeling sore. \nTo make matters worse, the competition running Windows have never been better. If you're fed up with Apple putting thinness over utility, these are the best alternatives to the MacBook Pro lineup. And, guess what? Most of these awesome PCs are significantly cheaper and better-equipped. These are all the dongles you need for the MacBook Pro About the Late 2016 MacBook Pros \nHere's something that few people realize: Apple now sells five different products with the MacBook Pro name. There are three new models for 2016, and two models that are holdovers from the previous generation. Apple now sells five different products with the MacBook Pro name. \nThe new MacBook Pros are furthermore complicated by their choices in processor. The entry-level 13-inch (the one with two USB-C ports and no Touch Bar), that sells for $1,499, now uses the weaker 15W Intel processor, which previously was only in the MacBook Air line of products. Arguably, this model arguably shouldn't get the Pro moniker, but you're paying a Pro price for it anyway. \nThe middle-tier, $1,799 13-inch MacBook Pro has a slightly more powerful 28W dual-core Intel processor inside (with Iris 550 graphics), features double the ports of the entry-level, and also gives you Apple's new Touch Bar. \nApple's big kahuna is the 15-inch MacBook Pro, which features quad-core Intel i7 chips, also from the 6th generation. This time around, Apple opted for AMD graphics in the 15-inch, putting it behind the latest generation of Nvidia graphics that are VR capable. Unlike the last-generation product, you can't get Iris Pro graphics for less money. Alternative to the MacBook Pro (13-inch, no Touch Bar)   HP Spectre X360 (late 2016) : $341–$600 cheaper \nWe loved HP's latest 2-in-1 laptop, and it's a serious contender for your next computer. Even though it's thin and made of high-quality metal, and includes advanced tech (HP's built in a camera that lets you log in with your face, whereas Apple makes you pay more for TouchID) that Apple left out of its least expensive Pro. Inside is a newer 7th gen Intel i7. Granted, the Mac has better Iris graphics, but Intel's given its new HD 620 graphics a solid boost, narrowing the gap a bit. \nIf you're concerned about ports, HP has two USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports to match the entry-level MacBook Pro, but one-ups it with a standard USB 3.0 port. HP also hasn't forgotten that human beings need to be able to type on its keyboards, and the Spectre X360 one of the best we've typed on this year. \nSince it's cheaper than the Mac you need not feel guilty when treating yo'self to the $1,300 Spectre X360, which gives you double the RAM and storage space. Ordering the low-end MacBook Pro with this much RAM and storage is almost $2,000 after tax, making it astonishingly overpriced. Razer Blade Stealth : $550–$600 cheaper \nThe latest ultrabook from Razer is a big improvement over its first attempt early this year, sporting an updated 7th gen i7 processor as standard, and 16 GB RAM in every model except the cheapest. It's an awesome alternative to the cheap MacBook Pro. \nWhen configured with a 12.5-inch QHD+ touchscreen, 16 GB RAM, and 256 GB of solid state storage, you're looking at saving $550 over the MacBook. Bump up to the bigger capacity 512 GB version and you're looking at a $600 savings. That's a lot of dough. \nThis Blade Stealth has Thunderbolt 3, just like the MacBook, but you'll also find normal USB ports, and an HDMI too. Look a little closer at the spec sheet, and you'll find that its single-core i7 performance outdoes the i5 in the Mac, and you get twice the RAM, all the while saving at least half a grand. Alternatives to the MacBook Pro (13-inch, with Touch Bar)   XPS 13 (9360) i7 QHD+ : $200–$450 cheaper \nDell's awesome XPS 13 got a 7th generation makeover a little while ago, and as such, is totally worth considering. Its dual-core i7 option is a little slower than Apple's in the mid-tier version (the processor Apple uses here isn't common on the PC side), but the new 7th gen chips feature faster standard graphics than ever. Where Dell makes up for its shortcomings on sheer horsepower, is when it comes to versatility. \nThe MacBook Pro at this price level has four USB-C/Thunderbolt 3 ports, but Dell gives you a Thunderbolt 3, two USB 3.0, and an SD card reader. Where the XPS shines is if you want a big 1 TB SSD and 16 GB RAM—Apple makes you pay $450 more for both of these options compared to the Dell. Dell uses standard M.2 SSDs in its laptops, making storage upgrades a cinch.   i5 : up to $100 cheaper \nThis is a wild-card pick that, for some, will be a weird comparison. That said, what Surface Book offers is a more advanced, flexible design that can double as a tablet for short periods of time. For artistic folks, the inclusion of a great digital pen makes it way more interesting than the comparable Macs. \nSporting a 6th generation dual-core i5, Surface Book loses out on the performance front but with its solid keyboard, 2 USB 3.0 ports, and SD card reader, it's immediately more familiar and useful. It has a super high-quality display that almost rivals that of the MacBook Pro, and instead of a measly Touch Bar, you're treated to a full touchscreen instead. \nIf you're unwilling to compromise on build quality and design, Surface Book is a Mac alternative that, for the right buyer, feels more futuristic and versatile. Alternatives to the MacBook Pro (15-inch, with Touch Bar)   Razer Blade (late 2016): $300–$600 cheaper \nRazer's hardware has never been better, and the new Blade really lands a solid right hook against the MacBook Pro. Built around much of the same hardware as the Mac, this looks for all the world like the evil mirror universe version of the 15-inch MacBook Pro. \nInside, you get a quad-core i7, like the MacBook Pro, but what makes the Blade sharper than the Mac is its GPU. The Radeon-based GPUs in the 15-inch Macs is notably weaker than the new Nvidia GTX 1060 in Razer's laptops. Not only is this Nvidia processor faster, but you also get triple the GDDR5 VRAM of the entry-level MacBook Pro and it's VR ready. So, it's cheaper, faster, but still thin and light. Storage is provided by an M.2 SSD, which you'll be able to replace down the road if you need more space. \nThe only thing you might not like is the polarizing, tribal snake logo on the back of the display, but that's about it. Dell XPS 15 (9550) : $550–$750 cheaper \nWe were suitably impressed by Dell's big, sleek 15-inch XPS 15 earlier this year. It has a wider array of options than what Apple offers on its 15-inch MacBook Pro, but the quad-core i7 models start at $1,649. That nets you the same quad chip as the $2,300 base MacBook Pro 15-inch, twice the PCIe storage space, and the same amount of RAM. What you don't get in this configuration is a high-res display, as Dell has opted for a more efficient HD matte, non-touch screen. \nIf you want a glorious 4K screen, Dell has that as an option, as well. In its $1,849 XPS 15, you'll get a smaller 255 GB SSD but everything else plus the addition of a gorgeous, borderless 4K touchscreen. That makes the Dell an awesome option for video editing since Apple's portable Retina screens don't hit that resolution quite yet. Dell makes the transition to USB-C easier by including 2 old-school USB ports, HDMI, and an SD card slot alongside Thunderbolt 3. \nThere's one sticking point for a lot of MacBook Pro shoppers, and that's the lack of RAM. Apple's options only come with 16 GB, and it's not upgradeable later on. Dell, on the other hand, has two DDR4 slots, and you can max out the XPS 15 with a whopping 32 GB. Also unlike the Mac, Dell's used industry-standard M.2 SSDs that you can easily swap out later, a huge plus for media professionals who never can have too much space. \n  Advertisement",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 at 9:37 pm \nThe reason why Apple is researching the iPhone to the USA for you stupid Apple fans is: Apple is having severe employee problems with their assembler Foxconn. Employees are killing themselves due to the working conditions at their dorm camp plants. Even the Chinese Government is looking into Apples terrible working conditions. This has been going on for years, yet Apple keeps it covered up and the news media you people finally learned that is lying to you keeps it covered up. Apple is of course a very liberal company so they get away with murder. But yes, you loyal Apple customers keep buying that product and think about those young girls that put your phone together for $1.85 hour. They work at least 6 days a week 60-80 hours a week, then walk or ride in the company bus back to their bug rodent infected, mold covered wall room. Then they share that room with 10 to 14 people! Then during the assembly process they handle one of the most toxic things made today, your great touch screen you love so much! Its full of mercury and arsenic! Don’t worry when your daughter drops that phone and it cracks and leaks out those chemicals in your daughters hand! EPA, no a piece of coal is worse but not an Apple product. Its a liberal company. EPA doesn’t worry that nitrogen trifluoride is 17,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide. Its a liberal company. They have to use robotics to manufacturer their products in the future, its not that their a great company actually they are a greedy liberal company. As with most liberals they got caught. Thank God! They can bring this to the USA for $75 more just demand it. But it will be robots doing the work. But this will bring new jobs someone needs to build, install and service those robots. Just google foxconn working conditions to find more facts.",

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money.",

      "text": "Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ issue Apple launches repair program for iPhone 6 Plus ‘touch disease’ issue Apple has launched the repair program for iPhone 6 Plus, but it is charging users over $149 to fix the issue. By: Tech Desk | Published:November 18, 2016 9:44 am Apple repair program: The ‘touch disease’ as it is being called, can cause the iPhone 6 Plus display to start flickering.(Source: Reuters) \nApple has launched a repair program for iPhone 6 Plus users, whose device has an issue with the display. The ‘touch disease’ as it is being called, can cause the iPhone 6 Plus display to start flickering or the multi-touch function stops working. While Apple has launched the repair program, it’s not doing this repair free of cost. The company says the issue happens because a device might have dropped too many times on a hard surface, which caused “further stress on the device.” \nAccording to reports, iPhone 6 Plus users have complained of touchscreen not working, and usually a “thin grey line” appears at the top of the display. But it looks like Cupertino is blaming this on being careless with the device. Apple will be charging $149 for users whose iPhone 6 Plus is exhibiting these problems, provided it is in working order, and you’ve not cracked the display. \nApple also says it will reimburse customers who might have “paid for a service repair related to this issue either through Apple or an Apple Authorized Service Provider.” For those who believe they got a repair related to this issue but have not been contacted by the company, they need to get in touch with Apple. \nAccording to Apple, “the reimbursement amount will equal the difference between the price paid for the original service and the $149 service price.” \nAlso read: Apple iPhone 7 Plus review: Buy it just for the camera, but that’s not the only great feature \nApple says it will examine the iPhone 6 Plus for before the service in order to determine if the device is eligible for this program. The smartphone needs to be in a working condition. Apple is also telling customers to back up their data to iTunes or iCloud before giving the device for service. Apple will also limit repair to the original country of purchase. \nThis is a worldwide program, so iPhone 6 Plus India users can also go to the authorised Apple Service Centre if they’ve been facing this issue. Apple says it will cover “iPhone 6 Plus devices for 5 years after the first retail sale of the unit.” © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "1250.00 USD \nCompetition in chipland is getting hotter than a deep fryer. \nConfirming what had long been speculated, Qualcomm Inc. late Thursday announced that it would be contracting Samsung Electronics Co. to make Snapdragon processors at 10-nanometer geometry. Those semiconductors will be in products early next year. \nThat's bad news for the world's largest chip foundry, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., but probably music to the ears of Apple Inc. Using the smaller manufacturing technology, compared with the previous 14-nanometer, allows Qualcomm to sell chips with a tinier footprint and up to 40 percent lower power consumption, the two holy grails of mobile electronics. Keeping the Faith Investors remain enamored with TSMC despite the many challenges to its business Source: Bloomberg \nTSMC and Samsung wage a battle to shrink chips in approximately two-year cycles, with the quickest to the next milestone gaining a first-mover advantage in shopping that offering to clients. In this round, the timing is roughly equal. \nWinning the gig for Qualcomm's next batch likely means that TSMC loses out, and that means one less client ready to spend the billions of dollars the Taiwanese chipmaker needs to fund the exorbitant costs of equipping its factories. \nTSMC says it already has five products being readied for production (called tape out) at 10-nanometer, yet independent semiconductor analyst Andrew Lu recently noted a change of tone in the company's outlook for expansion of the technology (called ramp up). \nApple's estimated share of TSMC sales in 2H 20% \nFrom \"steep ramp\" in its second-quarter analyst conference, TSMC in its latest investor chat referred to \"ramp up based on the customers' demand,\" Lu wrote in a report published by Smartkarma. Lu also estimates that 20 percent of TSMC's sales in the second half of 2016 will come from Apple, using an older technology. That's a lot, and with a less enthusiastic tone being struck for the next product lineup, such dependence is likely to remain high. Less Is Moore As PCs decline, the demand for smaller and faster communications chips has driven TSMC sales Source: TSMC \nTo be sure, don't be surprised to see TSMC strike back with a few product announcements of its own, trumpeting a client or two that's collaborating with it for 10-nanometer -- replete with warm statements about what a great partner the Taiwan company is. Yet as I have previously argued , the list of clients needing the latest and greatest manufacturing technology is shrinking, and that makes each salvo fired in this foundry death match all the more deadly. \nKnowing this, Apple enjoys an increasingly strong bargaining position when it comes to negotiating the next supply deal. With its own business under assault, any chance to gain an upper hand should be welcome in Cupertino.

      "title": "Top Hedge Funds Buy P&G, Apple, BABA But Shed Healthcare",
      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Wall Street pays close attention to the quarterly 13F reports from hedge funds, scruitanizing — an sometime copying — the portfolio moves of titans like Carl Icahn and Dan Loeb .\nGetty Images What do we learn if we look at the third wquarter buying and selling among the top 50 hedge funds? According to FactSet Research , hedge funds grew more bullish on stocks , expanding their exposure to equities by 2.9% during Q3. That’s a marked turnaround from Q2 when equity exposure dropped 1.3%.\nWhere did all this buying take place? According to the FactSet report, hedge funds bought $12.2 billion worth of stock in the consumer staples sector, including $8.9 billion in share of P&G ( PG ). In fact, P&G was the top hedge fund purchase of Q3.\nFactSet went into more detail\nMillennium Management was the primary driver of the inflows into these two stocks. It is interesting to note that Procter & Gamble became the fourth largest holding in the top 50 hedge fund portfolio, yet the stock was only held by 11 funds at the end of Q3. P&G’s stock is up 5.3% year-to-date, while Coty’s stock is down nearly 29% year-to-date.\nApple ( AAPL ) was the second-largest hedge fund purchase, a big switch from Q2 when it was t he biggest sale. Hedge funds bought $6.3 billion of technology stocks in Q3, including $2.1 billion of Apple , followed by Alphabet ( GOOG ) and Alibaba ( BABA ), with purchases of $1.4 billion each, and $1.2 billion of eBay ( EBAY ) shares.\nFacebook ( FB ), meanwhile, was the most widely held stock.\nAnd health-care stocks remained on the outs with hedge funds, with Q3 sales totaling $2 billion. The top sale was Allergan ( AGN ) at $1.8 billion.\nFactSet went into more detail\nAllergan was the top sale of both Icahn Associates and Third Point during Q3. Keep in mind that this selloff is not uncommon for Allergan. In Q2, the company was the third largest aggregate sale by the top 50 hedge funds. Allergan’s stock is down over 37% year-to-date. Funds also sold large positions in Israel-based pharma company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries , and animal health firm, Zoetis . Both are in the top ten list of aggregate sales for Q3, which is shown on page six of this report",

      "text": "Previous Next \nA few weeks ago Apple warned about counterfeit iPhone cords and chargers, and the overheating and fire risks they can present. \nNow one woman wants everyone to know the risks of buying non Apple-certified accessories, saying she's lucky her house didn't burn down. \n'I just heard an explosion' \nKatie Skerchock grabbed her iPhone one recent morning, with no idea what was about to happen. \n\"My alarm was going off Saturday morning, and like clockwork. I pulled the charger from my phone,\" she said, explaining that this is what she does every morning. \nShe dropped the cord next to her nightstand, as usual, but couldn't believe what happened next. \n\"I just heard an explosion,\" she said. \"And I stopped a second and wondered 'what was that?' And I look down and see sparks.\" \nIt turns out that when she dropped the cord, it fell onto the plug, and the metallic braided covering shorted out, sending sparks everywhere. \nLuckily, Skerchock says, it didn't ignite her carpeting, though it left scorch marks on her bedroom wall. \nBut she was stunned, as she assumed her gold braided cord was stronger than the white plastic Apple cords. \n\"All the regular cords, they bend and show wires over time, so I was thinking this would hold up forever,\" she said. \nShe didn't realize when she bought the cord that the braided metal covering was a natural conductor. \nApple fights back \nAll this comes just a weeks after Apple issued a nationwide alert about third party chargers and cords sold for iPhones, filing a lawsuit accusing some third party Amazon sellers of selling counterfeit Apple accessories. \nApple says it has no way to guarantee that any of those products are safe. \nSo how can you protect yourself? Apple says buy only Apple brand or Apple Certified chargers and cords. Certified cords will have a\"MFi\" logo saying Apple has checked them for safety. \nKatie Skerchock says she'll steer clear of non-certified accessories in the future. \nWe tried to contact the manufacturer, but she did not save the packaging. And when we checked the discount store where she bought the cord, it no longer had the metal braided cord for sale. \nSo be careful what you buy, so you stay safe and you don't waste your money. \n\n\"Like\" John Matarese on Facebook \nFollow John on Twitter ( @johnmatarese ) Copyright 2015 Scripps Media, Inc.

      "text": "Cord-Cutters, Rejoice! Sony Expands PlayStation Vue Streaming Service To Apple TV 17 November 2016, 11:14 pm EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times The PlayStation Vue app is now ready to stream on Apple TV, and Sony has outlined how easy the process works. The app already supports both Roku and Android TV platforms. ( Sony ) Advertisement \nIn yet another manifestation of the exploding number of cord-cutters, Sony announced it is expanding its PlayStation Vue app to the Apple TV. The new functionality will allow PlayStation 4 to stream its live TV programming to the Apple's set top box. PlayStation Vue On Apple TV \nTo the uninitiated, the PlayStation Vue is a streaming service that offers several live TV packages. It also includes on-demand video content as well as cloud-based DVR streaming. This last is particularly appealing to multiple device owners, as up to five linked devices can simultaneously stream content. \n\"You will be able to take advantage of Apple TV's Siri Remote and easy navigation with touch, while enjoying PlayStation Vue's sleek look and feel,\" Sony said in a blog post. \"PlayStation Vue brings popular programming to Apple TV, from live sports networks like ESPN and NFL Network, to premium channels like AMC, FX, HBO, and Showtime.\" \nPlayStation Vue bundles cost from $30 to $65 per month. Those figures are slashed to $30 and $40 in regions that are covered by live network programming. How It Works \nIt is simple to use PlayStation Vue in Apple TV. Users will only need to link their subscription to the device, and they can immediately begin streaming. It is important to remember that it is still not possible to subscribe to PlayStation Vue directly on Apple TV. Consumers will have to go to its website in order to do that. \nThis slightly roundabout way is attributed to the fact that PlayStation Vue is not integrated into the Apple TV ecosystem. Some observers believe that this strategy is in place for Sony to avoid paying the premium Apple imposes on media providers selling content in its iOS and TVOS app stores. The Future Vue \nIt is not clear yet what Sony will do once the recently announced Apple TV app rolls out. This is the new Apple solution that combines all media content from different streaming services in one location. The company is offering to slash its revenue share in the App Store if media providers will agree to be integrated into the app. \nWhile barely 18 months has passed since it was introduced , PlayStation Vue is already emerging as one of the TV streaming leaders, competing with the likes of DISH Network's Sling TV, AT&T's DirecTV and even Netflix . Its expansive programming is complemented by its availability on the PlayStation console, Roku and Android TV . TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.
