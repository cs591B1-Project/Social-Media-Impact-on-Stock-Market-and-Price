      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\n\"The Quote: -unQuote: concessions are minimal and very much in line with the openness that Microsoft has been pursuing in the last few years,\" said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\n-- Jay Greene contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 06, 2016 14:14 ET (19:14 ",

      "text": "BRUSSELS—The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, post-merger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to its Office programs for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe EU's approval deals a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer relationship management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to allow rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft will allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nIn addition, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a program used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the program, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 06, 2016 12:15 ET (17:15 ",

      "text": "By: PRWeb via PRWeb  00 PM EST Sensei Project Solutions Releases Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Microsoft Project Online in the Microsoft Office Store \nNew app helps Resource Managers and Project Managers balance resource capacity and demand in a fast and intuitive way in Microsoft Project Online \n  \nSensei Project Solutions announced today the official launch of the Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Project Online, which provides support for Microsoft’s new ‘Resource Engagement Model.’ \n“Resource managers can now quickly see bottlenecks across the organization and proactively manage allocations of resources to projects,” said Kenneth Steiness, CEO of Sensei Project Solutions. “Project managers also benefit, as they can see conflicts for resources assigned to their projects.” \nThree heatmaps help visualize the balance between resource capacity and demand in a much faster and more intuitive way. \nAvailability Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their capacity. This quickly shows how busy resources are with work from project schedules. \nEngagement Heatmap - Shows the engagement of resources in relation to their capacity. This allows resource managers to quickly determine the commitment level of resources. \nCoverage Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their engagements. This allows resource and project managers to ascertain mismatches in resourcing between the project schedules and engagements. \nWhen you view the Heatmaps, the coloring immediately draws your attention to problems. As users of Project Online would expect, a single click on the schedule icon will open the Project Desktop client to the relevant schedule, where the problem can be fixed immediately. \nThe Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App is available for individual users in the Microsoft Office Store, and organizations can purchase an Enterprise license directly from Sensei Project Solutions. \nAbout Sensei Project Solutions: Sensei Project Solutions, a Finalist for the 2015 Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) Partner of the Year, focuses on bringing Instant Productivity to your team.

Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 06, 2016 13:33 ET (18:33 ",

      "title": "Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update Will Go All-In on Security | News & Opinion | PCMag.com",
      "text": "Microsoft has unveiled Windows 10 Creators update features focused specifically on security advancements for enterprise customers and IT administrators. New features include a centralized security management portal that integrates with third-party security platforms, updates to Windows Defender Advanced Threat protection, and enhanced mobile application management for employee-owned devices.\nWhen Microsoft unveiled its Windows 10 Creators Update in October, the company was making an obvious play at professional designers, creative hobbyists, and businesses willing to experiment with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The update hinted at a future in which consumers would be able to pull a photo of an armoire from an e-commerce website, convert it into a three-dimensional life-size image, and project a hologram of it into their bedrooms in order to determine if it's the right fit and style before purchasing it. Companies would be able to offer virtual tours of showroom floors. You could browse the stores at a mall in Dubai and make purchases without ever leaving your couch in Des Moines. The revolutionary technology would enable businesses to make this possible, Microsoft claimed. But would businesses bite?\nShortly after the launch of Windows 10 in July of last year, Gartner Research predicted that 50 percent of businesses would begin Windows 10 adoption by January 2017. A February 2016 survey from system management company Adaptiva was even more bullish, with 63 percent of business respondents saying they expected to deploy Windows 10 by the end of 2016. Unfortunately for Microsoft, some early reports claimed actual (not intended) business adoption was as low as one percent, while other more optimistic surveys pegged the actual adoption rate at 38 percent . Microsoft, which does not reveal actual enterprise adoption stats, said in a statement that adoption had escalated 300 percent over the past six months. \nIn order to get buy-in from enterprises, Microsoft has gone to great efforts to try to secure Windows 10. Unfortunately, the operating system (OS) continues to suffer exploits that leave Windows 10 and its apps open to manipulation. Last month, the company patched 68 flaws, two of which had been exploited by hackers. Those patches join a long list of updates and fixes that the company has configured in order to make the system as airtight as possible.\n\nWindows Security Center Windows Security Center, which was released for Windows 10 in July, will be able to link back to the Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection suite in order to let IT admins track security events across the Windows ecosystem. Combined with new detection, third-party integrations, and the ability to isolate machines and quarantine files, these new features are designed to deliver faster, more comprehensive security procedures for organizations running across the Windows 10 ecosystem.\n\nMore specifically, IT admins will be able to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications that indicate potential kernel exploits. Teams can feed third-party intelligence into the Windows Security Center for alerts on activities for an additional layer of insight. Once attacks are confirmed, IT can isolate infected machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes, and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center, according to a Microsoft statement.\n\nBetter Device Management Microsoft will also begin to roll out new insights to the Windows Analytics dashboard that are designed to let IT managers handle device telemetry for device upgrades, updates, and health processes. The update will also automate Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) conversion for legacy BIOS on Windows 7. Rather than re-partition the disc and reconfigure the firmware in order to convert to UEFI, Microsoft has built a tool that will automatically handle the conversion.\nIT will now be able to protect data on personal devices without having to enroll the device in a mobile device management (MDM) program . IT will be able to apply policies to business-specific apps in order to secure corporate information, without having to manage an employee's entire device.\nWhether or not these updates can lure reluctant businesses to Windows 10 remains to be seen. However, the updates address the concerns of businesses that have struggled with the unknown risks of migrating to a relatively new OS.",

      "text": "View Comments \nBy Emeka Aginam \nThe Director of Software Engineering, Microsoft Corp, Bambo Sofola, has expressed satisfaction at the zeal and creativity of Nigerian entrepreneurs. \nThis follows the the number and quality of entries received before the final winners selected for the inaugural class of WINsiders4Good Fellows, part of the Windows Insider Programme. \nSofola who spoke recently in Lagos when Microsoft in partnership with Co-Creation Hub (CCHub) announced the first class of fellows in its Windows Insiders for Good Fellowship programme noted that the global goal of the program is to empower the community of people using technology to make a lasting impact on the world. \nIt would be recalled that in September, Microsoft and Co-Creation Hub opened their doors to opportunities for Nigerian entrepreneurs to submit brilliant ideas they believe can be used to positively impact the world we live in. \nAccording to him, “We at the Windows Insider Program and Co-Creation Hub (CCHub) are proud to announce the first ever class of WINsider4Good Fellows. We were excited to select Nigeria as the place to begin this fellowship, and Nigerian entrepreneurs have shown us their creative ideas to positively impact the lives of their fellow Nigerians.” \nOn the selection process, Sofola said, “We employed careful selection criteria to select our winners here today. Each of the applicants was asked to think deeply about the issues confronting his or her community, the solutions that could address these issues, and the opportunities for the solution to thrive in the market. \n“After a thorough consideration in partnership with CCHub, we selected fellows whom we are glad to bolster with our global network, our boot camp and six month fellowship.” \nFor the Co-Founder ofCCHub, Femi Longe, the future of young Nigerians is in technology. “There is every need to create platforms to help them conquer their future needs and challenges. \nHe stated that the WINsiders4Good Fellowship will connect Nigerian entrepreneurs to a global community of people like them, prioritize and solve the technical issues that can hinder them from reaching their goal. \n“Honestly, it’s been an interesting journey thus far. From the number of entries we received, to the rigour of combing every idea to be sure they align with the purpose the programme aims to achieve. I believe this is an indication that something phenomenal is happening in the Nigeria’s ICT space,” Longe said. \nSpeaking with excitement, one of the winners, Miracle Samuel, the entrepreneur behind 24/7 Charging Hub,expressed his delight at this opportunity that Microsoft and Co-Creation Hub have given him. \nSamuel said, “This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and I am glad to have made it into the WInsiders4Good Fellowship in Nigeria. It is an opportunity I will forever cherish and I am looking forward to it.” \nThese fellows had converged in Lagos early in the month to begin their one week boot camp and six-month engagement with the Windows Insider Program and the Co-Creation Hub, receiving tailored strategic and technical mentor ship along with access to the latest hardware and software from Microsoft.

      "text": "  09:00 AM EST Laser Lab Partners with Microsoft to Offer Office 365 Cloud-Based Productivity Applications to [AREA] Businesses IT Services Firm Gives Office 365 Advice to Local Entrepreneurs and Offers Free Assessment Ephrata, PA   \n​Laser Lab , a managed services provider (MSP) specializing in helping organizations gain efficiency and cost savings through technology, today announced its partnership as an authorized implementation and support partner for Microsoft Office 365 . \nThe newest (and most powerful) version of Microsoft’s ubiquitous Office software suite, Office 365 is a cloud-hosted software-as-a-service (SaaS) solution that provides businesses with powerful, feature-rich versions of Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and other productivity applications, as well as hosted Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive storage, Skype for Business and more. \nAccording to Michele McHenry, CEO at Laser Lab, “Office 365 is one of the most innovative and revolutionary offerings we’ve seen from Microsoft in the past few years. It has tons of great features, is built for productivity and collaboration, gives IT teams greater control over security and data privacy, and delivers a consistent user experience whether used on a computer or mobile device. But, despite all these benefits, there are still companies that hesitate to upgrade to Office 365. It’s my hope that we can help Pennsylvania small and medium-sized businesses make the transition, and become more mobile, flexible and competitive.” \nFive Reasons Why Small and Medium-Sized Businesses Should Upgrade to Office 365 \n1. Greater Flexibility \nUnlike previous versions of Office where you would purchase the software along with a limited number of licenses, Office 365 can be easily scaled to meet the needs of your business. Administrators can add or remove users easily, and only pay for the licenses used per month. \n2. Automatic Updates \nBecause it’s a cloud-based service, all applications are automatically kept up to date. This improves security and ensures that all users have access to the same set of features. \n3. Made for Mobility \nOffice 365 allows users to work and collaborate from anywhere, and on virtually any type of device. Shared documents can be accessed via OneDrive cloud storage and Skype for Business allows real-time communication from a computer, smartphone or tablet. \n4. Enhanced Security \nData security is the top priority for most businesses. Office 365 uses BitLocker, SSL over HTTP and IRM to ensure your valuable documents and data stay safe. Plus, it requires all users to implement a strong password or multi-factor authentication for additional security. \n5. A Better Exchange \nOffice 365’s cloud-based version of Exchange provides all the benefits of Exchange Server 2010 without the costs associated with deploying it in-house. It offers user mailboxes up to 25 GB and allows recovery of deleted items even they’ve been manually purged. \nTo better aid businesses in making the transition to Office 365, Laser Lab is offering a free Office 365 consultation through the end of December. For a small to medium-sized business or non-profit to qualify, they must be in Lancaster Berks, Lebanon, or West Chester county, and have a business that relies on computer systems for day-to-day operations. Qualifying organizations can sign up for their no-cost assessment online or call 717-738-3333. \nAbout Laser Lab \nLaser Lab is a managed print and IT services provider for small and medium-sized businesses located throughout South Central Pennsylvania. Some of the company’s services and solutions include print services, office equipment, OEM and remanufactured toner cartridges, cloud computing solutions, IT consulting, data backup and disaster recovery , and customized IT services.

      "text": "Workspot dramatically simplifies VDI by leveraging the power of Microsoft Azure to deliver the first DaaS 2.0 Solution DaaS 2.0 enables organizations of all sizes to deploy VDI for thousands of end users in a single day with no additional CAPEX\nLAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - Dec 6, 2016) - Gartner Data Center, Infrastructure & Operations Management Conference -- Workspot (workspot.com), the leader in next-generation Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI), announced today they are extending their cloud-native, multi-tenant architecture to offer Desktop as a Service 2.0 (DaaS 2.0) on Microsoft Azure. As a Microsoft Cloud Solutions Provider (CSP), Workspot is providing organizations of all sizes the simplest and fastest path to adopting VDI on Azure.\nWorkspot's solution is deeply integrated with Azure, automating and optimizing resources within a matter of minutes. Workspot DaaS 2.0 automatically streamlines the usage of the virtual network, virtual storage, and compute services included in the Azure infrastructure. The cloud-native architecture and built-in automations maximizes deployment speed, performance, and flexibility and minimizes costs across all Azure regions, resulting in optimized and predictable per user billing.\nAccording to Gartner, \"by 2019, 50% of new virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) users will be deployed on DaaS platforms.\" 1\n\"Workspot has been empowering companies of all sizes to go live with desktop virtualization in just 60 minutes,\" states Amitabh Sinha, CEO and Co-Founder of Workspot. \"We are extending our rock-solid VDI 2.0 architecture to leverage the power of Microsoft Azure and deliver the only all-cloud VDI solution on the market. Our DaaS 2.0 solution enables a customer to simultaneously deliver desktops from the Microsoft Azure cloud and from on-premises infrastructure while managing the entire environment from a single console.\"\n\"In addition to having a single management console, Workspot has put a lot of work into power management, usage reporting, billing, and more,\" states Gabe Knuth in his recent article Workspot enters the DaaS space.

      "title": "EU Clears $26 Billion Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal -- 3rd Update",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's$26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\n\"The Quote: -unQuote: concessions are minimal and very much in line with the openness that Microsoft has been pursuing in the last few years,\" said Stifel Nicolaus & Co. analyst Brad Reback.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\n-- Jay Greene contributed to this article.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-06-161414ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "  Microsoft’s Downside December 06, 2016 | About: MSFT +0% LNKD +0% ADP +0% \n(Published Dec. 6 by Bob Ciura) \nMicrosoft Corp. ( NASDAQ:MSFT ) has everything a dividend growth investor could ask for. It is a highly profitable company with a well-defined growth plan and an excellent balance sheet. \nIt also has an appealing dividend yield of 2.5%, and it has delivered regular dividend growth. \nMicrosoft is a Dividend Achiever, a group of companies that have increased their dividends for at least the past 10 years. \nYou can see the entire list of all 273 Dividend Achievers here . \nPlus, Microsoft has made huge progress in its business turnaround, thanks to emerging areas of growth like the cloud. \nThis has fueled impressive share price performance: Microsoft stock price is up 139% in just the past five years. \nThe only downside of Microsoft’s huge rally over the past few years is that it has elevated the stock’s valuation. This could limit future returns. \nThis article will review Microsoft’s fundamentals and its outlook. \nBusiness overview \nMicrosoft is a global technology powerhouse. It is the largest software company in the world. Its flagship software products include Microsoft Office and the Windows operating system. It also sells technology hardware including the Xbox gaming console and the Surface tablet. \nMicrosoft was founded in 1975 and today operates in over 190 countries worldwide. \nThis is a challenging period for Microsoft. For most of its existence, Microsoft’s software was built for the personal computer, but the PC is in decline. \nAccording to technology tracking firm IDC, worldwide PC shipments fell 3.9% last quarter . \nAs a result, Microsoft is looking toward a post-PC world. This is why it has developed its software for the cloud, called Office 365. \nIt now provides its productivity and business process tools as cloud services. \nThis means consumers can access their software programs from anywhere and from any device. \nAt the same time, Microsoft is working to build what it calls the intelligent cloud. In the new era of the cloud, there is a great importance on data collection and storage. As a result, there will be much higher demand for data centers and servers moving forward. \nMicrosoft’s server products and cloud services include Microsoft SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center and Microsoft Azure. \nGrowth prospects \nMicrosoft’s turnaround has seen its ups and downs, but it is making steady progress. Revenue fell 2% in fiscal 2016 as the company fought against the strong U.S. dollar, which makes exports less competitive in the international markets. \nIn addition, Microsoft still generates a significant amount of business from the PC. Declines in global PC shipments are headwinds for the company. \nThat being said, it is enjoying excellent growth in the areas that will fuel the company’s future. It saw strong growth across many of its other core businesses. \nLast year, Microsoft’s commercial cloud segment became a $12 billion business in terms of annual revenue. \nIt has seen very positive momentum this fiscal year. Office 365 commercial revenue soared nearly 60% last quarter, year over year. In the same period, revenue from Azure jumped more than 100%. \nLast quarter , Microsoft enjoyed continued growth across its focus areas. Revenue and earnings per share, adjusted for currency impacts, increased 5% and 13%. \nSource: Q1 Earnings Presentation , page 7 \nGrowth was led by the cloud once again. Commercial cloud revenue soared 54% in constant currency. Dynamics products and cloud services revenue increased 13%. \nServer products and cloud services revenue increased 13%, driven by 116% growth from Azure. \nMicrosoft is also seeing good performance in devices, particularly in tablets. Surface revenue increased 39% last quarter, due to the Surface Pro 4 and Surface Book. \nGoing forward, Microsoft is banking on its recent acquisition of LinkedIn ( NYSE:LNKD ) for future growth. The massive, $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn, a workplace social media platform, provides Microsoft with growth in professional networking. \nThe deal creates, in Microsoft’s assessment, a more than $300 billion addressable market. \nSource: LinkedIn acquisition presentation , page 9 \nMicrosoft should expand its scale with LinkedIn’s 430 million users. \nCompetitive advantages and recession performance \nMicrosoft’s main competitive advantage is its intellectual property. This is typically the case for large technology companies. Since the technology landscape changes so quickly, it is critical for tech firms to continue innovating new products and services. \nIn order to support its intellectual property, Microsoft spends heavily on research and development: 2014 R&D expense of $11.4 billion. 2015 R&D expense of $12 billion. 2016 R&D expense of $12 billion. \nSuch a huge amount of R&D spending is possible because of Microsoft’s tremendous financial resources. It has $137 billion of cash, marketable securities and short-term investments on the balance sheet. \nMicrosoft is one of only two U.S. companies to hold the AAA credit rating, along with Automatic Data Processing ( NASDAQ:ADP ), from Standard & Poor’s. \nIts balance sheet strength is a competitive advantage which allows the company to invest more than $10 billion each year into R&D. \nThe company has a DIVCON safety score of 4 out of 5, signifying that it is very unlikely the company will reduce its dividend. \nAnother competitive advantage for Microsoft is its strong brand. According to Forbes , Microsoft has the third-most valuable brand in the world. The Microsoft brand is reportedly worth $75.2 billion. \nYou might assume that a technology company like Microsoft would be extremely vulnerable to a recession. \nAnd while Microsoft did suffer an earnings-per-share decline in 2009, its growth rates in 2008 and 2010 more than made up for it. \nMicrosoft’s earnings per share through the Great Recession are shown below: 2007 earnings per share of $1.42. 2008 earnings per share of $1.87 (32% increase). 2009 earnings per share of $1.62 (13% decrease). 2010 earnings per share of $2.10 (30% increase). \nFinal thoughts \nAs mentioned previously, Microsoft’s valuation is its only downside. The stock has more than doubled over the past five years. It now trades for a price-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29. This is above the S&P 500 average P/E ratio of 25. \nMicrosoft stock trades significantly above its own historical average. Since 2000 , the stock has traded for an average P/E ratio of 18. \nWhile Microsoft is an excellent company , it is not priced attractively. Future returns would be better if investors buy Microsoft at the market valuation or better. This would also help raise the dividend yield back to 3%, a more appealing level. \nDividend growth investors may want to wait for the next market downturn before buying the stock. \nDisclosure: I am not long any of the stocks mentioned in this article. \nStart a free seven-day trial of Premium Membership to GuruFocus.

      "text": "\nEarlier today, Microsoft announced that the European Commission cleared its $26.2 billion acquisition of LinkedIn. The LinkedIn acquisition is definitely one of the fascinating acquisitions Microsoft made since the acquisition of Nokia, but there’s been a bit of controversy related to the acquisition.\nAs you may already know, Microsoft was in a bidding war with Salesforce, Facebook, and even Google for LinkedIn. However, the software giant ended up buying LinkedIn for $26.2 billion — and Salesforce certainly wasn’t happy about that. The company’s CEO, Marc Benioff was a close friend of Satya Nadella and both of the companies have been working together recently as well — but Benioff slammed Microsoft after the company apparently planned on preventing rivals from accessing LinkedIn data. As a result, there was a bit of uncertainty regarding whether the European Commission will clear the LinkedIn acquisition or not.\nThankfully, for Microsoft, as the acquisition has been cleared today, the acquisition should close pretty soon. Following the announcement, the folks at Business Insider reached out to Salesforce regarding their comment on the acquisition. In response, a Salesforce spokesperson stated that the company wants antitrust regulators to be “vigilant” with Microsoft considering Microsoft’s “history and existing monopolies.” Here’s the full statement:\n“Given Microsoft’s history and existing monopolies, it will be necessary for antitrust enforcement agencies to be vigilant to ensure that Microsoft operates in a manner that promotes competition, rather than stifles it . As AI, machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical datasets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policymakers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy.”\nThe data from LinkedIn is quite substantial for both Microsoft and Salesforce for their CRM businesses. Microsoft Dynamics will likely benefit quite a lot by utilizing the data from LinkedIn, but the company will likely be able to use the data to improve its artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies as well. It’s clear Salesforce isn’t happy with Microsoft after the LinkedIn acquisition, so it’ll certainly be very interesting to see what happens next between these companies — especially considering the fact that they were working really closely just a few months ago.",

      "text": "  3 minutes ago \nEarlier today, we reported that Microsoft updated its Groove app for the Xbox One, bringing back the ability to play music videos . The feature was never available on Windows 10 PCs or phones - until today, as the app was updated for Fast ring Insiders. \nOf course, not all songs have videos that you can play, but when you find one, you can turn the feature on by pressing the video button - which is located in the media controls - while it's playing. \nIf you've never tried out Microsoft's Groove Music service, the company is currently offering a promotion where you can get your first four months for free . The offer is valid until the end of the year, but you're only eligible if you've never used a free trial before. \nYou'll need to be on the Fast ring of the Windows Insider Preview to get version 10.16112.1015, or you can just wait for it to arrive in the Production ring (non-Insiders), which will likely only be a couple of weeks.

      "title": "Microsoft Internet Explorer 9 jscript9 JavaScriptStackWalker Memory Corruption",
      "text": "A specially crafted web-page can trigger a memory corruptionvulnerability in Microsoft Internet Explorer 9. A pointer set up topoint to certain data on the stack can be used after that data has beenremoved from the stack. This results in a stack-based analog to a heapuse-after-free vulnerability. The stack memory where the data was storedcan be modified by an attacker before it is used, allowing remote codeexecution.Known affected software and attack vectors An attacker would need to get a target user to open a specially crafted web-page. Disabling JavaScript should prevent an attacker from triggering the vulnerable code path.DescriptionMSIE attempts to handle stack exhaustion caused by excessive recursionin Javascript gracefully by generating a JavaScript exception. Whilegenerating the exception, information about the call stack is gatheredusing the JavascriptStackWalker class. It appears that the code thatdoes this initializes a pointer variable on the stack the first time itis run, but re-uses it if it gets called a second time. Unfortunately,the information the pointer points to is also stored on the stack, butis removed from the stack after the first exception is handled. Carefulmanipulation of the stack during both exceptions allow an attacker tocontrol the data the pointer points to during the second exception.ExploitThe vulnerable pointer points to valid stack memory during the firstexception, but it is \"popped\" from the stack before the second. In orderto exploit this vulnerability, the code executed during the firstexception is going to point this pointer to a specific area of thestack, while the code executed during the second is going to allocatecertain values in that same area before the pointer is re-used.Control over the stack contents during a stack exhaustion can beachieved by making the recursive calls with many arguments, all of whichare stored on the stack. This is similar to a heap-spray storing valueson large sections of the heap in that it is not entirely deterministic,but the odds are very highly in favor of you setting a certain value ata certain address.Further details of how to exploit this issue can be found in my blog athttp://blog.skylined.nl/20161206001.html",

      "text": "More \n\nAlthough Microsoft Edge has been playing catchup in adding many of the features we are used to seeing in other browsers it is steadily getting there. \nI suspect one of the under utilized features might be the web notifications that can be pushed from Microsoft Edge to your Action Center in Windows 10. \nPart of that reason is that not all websites, Twitter for instance, recognizes Microsoft Edge as capable of handling web notifications from their service. I am sure there are others out there as well but until Microsoft Edge gains more traction that is an unfortunate side effect. \nHowever, if you are running Windows 10 and use any services that support Microsoft Edge and web notifications then you will want to be able to manage them and this gallery walk through will show you how to do just that. \nAs you can see above Gmail supports web notifications in Microsoft Edge plus the web based Skype site also supports them. Outside of those two I have not come across others so would love to hear from you all on what sites you have discovered that support web notifications in Microsoft Edge. \nLeave us the sites name in the comments below - thanks!",

      "text": "\nMicrosoft is teaming up with Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube to help curb the spread of terrorist content on their services. These tech giants will be working together to identify and remove violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos/images from their services.\nAccording to a blog post from Facebook , the companies will share a database of hashes which will store the content that has been removed from their services. Using the database, other companies will be able to identify which content has been removed from other services — and then they can use those to remove that content from their own services, too. Facebook stated:\nStarting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of “hashes” — unique digital “fingerprints” — for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\nOur companies will begin sharing hashes of the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all of our respective companies’ content policies. Participating companies can add hashes of terrorist images or videos that are identified on one of our platforms to the database. Other participating companies can then use those hashes to identify such content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions, and remove matching content as appropriate.\nFacebook notes that none of the company will be sharing any personal information of their users as part of the partnership, which is definitely quite assuring to hear. Do keep in mind that companies will apply their own policies on the terrorist content, so not all content may get removed as it depends on a certain company’s policies.\n",

Featuring a truly ergonomic design, the keyboard does away with the traditional rectangular aesthetic of the original keyboard in favor of a more organically inspired shape. The keyboard features a soft section on the bottom for resting one's wrists, while the far right portion is outfitted with a numerical keyboard for quickly inputting digits or playing games. The Microsoft Surface Ergonomic PC Keyboard works with both PCs and laptops, and separates the keyboard in order to make it more suitable for healthy typing habits.",

      "text": "Microsoft Zo Sacrifices Functionality for Safety Share this content: Censored chatbot delivers better customer experience Zo \nMicrosoft has released a preview of its newest AI chatbot called Zo.ai, a successor to the company's controversial, famously ill-fated Tay.ai chatbot. \nThe program Zo was created by the Microsoft Research and Bing teams, in an effort to attract 18 to 24 year olds. Only available by invitation on messaging app Kik, Zo will ask for the person's Kik username and Twitter handle. If the user doesn't have Kik, he/she can click a box to offer information about their Facebook Messenger or Snapchat. \nOnce downloaded, Zo presents a far more-buttoned approach to the chatbot experience of Tay.ai, which the company revoked in March after users got it to spew racist, hate-filled comments. \n“Through our continued learning, we are experimenting with a new chatbot,\" a Microsoft spokeswoman said to Bloomberg . \"With Zo, we're focused on advancing conversational capabilities within our AI platform.\" \nIf prompted, Zo will not engage in political discussions, answer offensive questions or deliver offensive comments. For example, when MS Power User asked Zo “What's your feelings about Trump?”, the bot responded by saying, “People can say awful things while discussing politics, so I don't discuss.” \nBlanket avoidance of certain topics will undoubtedly limit some valuable use cases, especially in an environment where everyone seems to be discussing politics, but the alternative is to enable defacements and hate language, which would cause Microsoft to pull the app like they did Tay. \nMicrosoft has learned from its past mistakes and other companies looking to get into bots should heed the same warning. All brands will have to sacrifice form and functionality for safety. Trolls and critics will always test the boundaries of any corporate app, prodding it to do something off-brand. If a brand has to dumb down the bot in order to protect it from external malfeasance, it's a small price to pay. EXTENDED DEADLINE\nYou have until Wednesday, December 7 to get your entries in.

      "text": "Pin \n( ANTIWAR ) According to a new statement by Facebook, they have joined with YouTube, Microsoft, and Twitter to create a shared database of “terrorist content” which they can all jointly use to identify further attempts to post such banned content. \nThe database will create hashes of videos and images that they’ve already decided are related to terrorism, and then will allow them to single out any further content matching those hatches. Facebook says this will allow them to more quickly remove such content. \nThe move is an attempt to react to US government demands to “do something” against terrorist propaganda, with the companies apparently hoping that the voluntary crackdown will be enough to stave off any formal government efforts to regulate them. \nIt’s unclear exactly what the scope of this program is going to end up being, and how broadly defined “terrorist propaganda” will be. Company offiicals are downplaying concerns of censorship, however, insisting that they have to act quickly to take such content down so no one sees it.",

      "text": "12/06/16 AT 3:39 PM Close \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are teaming up to curb online terrorism content, the companies announced on Monday . \nThe tech giants will create a shared database of “hashes” to help them track violent terrorist imagery and terrorist recruitment videos or images that have been removed from their services. The companies will use the shared data to help identify potential terrorist content on the sites. \nOther participating companies can then use those hashes on the database to identify terrorist-related content on their services, review against their respective policies and definitions and remove matching content. \n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,” the companies said in a statement . \n“We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” the companies added. Related Stories Google Autocomplete Suggestions Deemed Racist, Sexist \nThe tech firms will independently determine what image or video hashes should be shared in the database. They say no personally identifiable information will be shared, and matching content will not be automatically removed. \nSocial media has been a tool for terrorists, including ISIS. The four companies agreed in May to European regulations that require them to review the majority of reports and remove illegal hate speech in less than 24 hours and remove it if necessary. The rule was agreed on to combat hate speech and terrorist propaganda across the EU. \nBack in February, Twitter announced it suspended 125,000 accounts for promoting terrorism. \nThe tech companies say they will focus on involving additional companies in the future.

      "text": "More \nBy Brett Molina | USA Today (Tribune News Service) | Published: December 6, 2016 \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they will create a database of terrorist content online to act more quickly whenever videos, imagery or other information appears on their platforms. \nIn a joint statement, the companies will share digital fingerprints called \"hashes\" for videos or images pulled from their platforms. \n\"We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,\" reads a portion of the statement. \nWhile all four companies will share content they've banned on their respective platforms, each can individually decide whether the banned content violates their own policies. \"Each company will continue to apply its own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content when a match to a shared hash is found,\" says the statement. \nCompanies have already taken some steps to hamper the ability of terrorist organizations to promote their group or recruit members. In August, Twitter revealed it suspended 235,000 accounts for promoting extremism and terrorism. \nThe initiative arrives as tech companies faced increasing pressure to quickly remove terrorist content or hate speech. Reuters reports the European Union is pushing Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube to move faster in scrubbing hate speech from their services. \n©2016 USA Today",

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 3 seconds ago with 0 comments \nAfter months of being sold out, the unlocked Lumia 640 XL suddenly showed that it was in-stock again in the US Microsoft Store again last night for a price of $149. The AT&T-locked model also showed up, which has been out of stock for weeks. \nBut less than 24 hours later, the unlocked model is once again showing as out of stock, and so is the black AT&T variant. If you want a Lumia 640 XL, your only option is white and locked to AT&T. Of course, it has a removable back, so the color really shouldn't be an issue. \nIn March, the device will turn two-years-old, so don't expect to see it in stock again at the Microsoft Store. Of course, seeing it last night was surprising enough. \nThe Lumia 640 XL has a quad-core Snapdragon 400 chipset, 1GB RAM, 8GB storage, a 13MP rear camera with a 1/3-inch sensor and f/2 aperture, and a 5MP front camera. The AT&T model is only $99, and if you know someone who has an account, it should be easy enough to get it unlocked. \nThe device will ship with Windows Phone 8.1 Update 2, but it's eligible for a Windows 10 Mobile upgrade. You can find the AT&T model in the Microsoft Store right here , and if the unlocked model shows up again, we'll be sure to let you know. \nIf you're considering picking one up, make sure to check out our review first.

      "text": "Tech Giants Fight Back Against Terrorist Propaganda TAMI ABDOLLAH \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\"— or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" \n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\" \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.",

      "text": "Four of the world’s biggest disseminators of online content—Facebook, Twitter, YouTube, and Microsoft—said today that they are ready to do more self-policing to keep terrorist propaganda from spreading on the internet.\nThe companies say they will create a shared database to track “violent terrorist imagery” and “terrorist recruitment videos or images,” helping each other more efficiently review content that might violate their specific policies. They will do this by logging hashes, digital identifiers that are unique to each piece of content. Once a hash is added to the database, each company will make its own decision about whether to remove that particular piece of content.\n“There is no place for content that promotes terrorism on our hosted consumer services,” the four companies said in a joint press release .\nConversations around what role tech companies should play in policing the content on their platforms have grown more urgent ever since Donald Trump won the US presidential election on Nov. 8. Much of the discussion has focused on the fake and often hate-fueled news that spread on Facebook and elsewhere during the campaign, as well as the “ filter bubbles ” of information created by social media and an increasingly fragmented media.\nThe collaboration announced today is limited to online terrorist content. It does not represent “a new normal” for other content questions, one of the companies involved said, adding that the spread of terrorism online “is a pressing problem that requires special attention from technology companies.” Creating a database has been under discussion for some time, the company said, declining to be more specific.\nFacebook will maintain the database, and only those working on the project will be able to contribute to and access it, with the potential for other companies to join in the future. Another participant said the database will not accept hashes flagged by governments and law enforcement, and that governments would need to submit formal requests for information maintained in it as they would for any other content inquiries.\nTwitter said in a statement that it has suspended more than 360,000 accounts since mid-2015 for violating its policy on “violent threats and the promotion of terrorism.” Microsoft in May banned terrorist content from its consumer services and said it was looking into ways of alerting users to “information that may cause them significant harm, including terrorist content” that was surfaced by its Bing search engine.\nAll four companies emphasized in the press release that they remain committed to protecting users’ privacy and freedom of expression.",

      "text": "print \nWASHINGTON (AP) — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online. \nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove. \nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues. \nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service. \nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack. \nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening. \nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate. \nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\" \n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman. \nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\" \nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups. \nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others. \nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group. \nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon. \nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled. \n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\" \nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said. \nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint. \nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content. \nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future. \n___ \nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams More from Associated Press: ",

      "text": "\nFacebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., as seen in 2015. Alison Yin/Invision for Nintendo/Facebook hide caption toggle caption Facebook headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., as seen in 2015. Alison Yin/Invision for Nintendo/Facebook \nFacebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube say they are creating a database to keep track of terrorist recruitment videos and other terror-related images that have been removed from their services. \nIn a joint statement posted by Facebook on Monday, the company said: \n\"Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of 'hashes' — unique digital 'fingerprints' — for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. \n\"By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms. We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online.\" \nThe collaboration will allow companies to cross reference videos and pictures that show up on their services with a database of those that have already been removed from other services. \nFor example, if a video glorifying violence in the name of the Islamic State has been removed from Twitter, it will be assigned a unique \"fingerprint\" which will be stored in the database. If the same video shows up on Facebook, Facebook will be able to match the video and, if it chooses, to remove it. Article continues after sponsorship \nThe choice about whether to remove such content falls to the companies, although videos and images related to terrorist or extremist organizations can also be pertinent to law enforcement. \nAs we have reported , identifying what is, or is not, terrorist imagery can be challenging for tech companies. For example, last year Facebook removed (at least temporarily) a parody photo posted by journalist Sultan Al-Qassemi depicting a rainbow pride filter over a picture of the leader of ISIS. Another Facebook user had taken it literally, and flagged it for containing \"graphic violence.\" \nIt was unclear whether the photo was permanently removed by the company. \nTwitter said earlier this year that it had \"increased the size of the teams that review reports,\" and suspended more than 125,000 accounts since mid-2015 — that number has since grown to about 360,000 — for what it called connections to terrorist or extremist groups. \nBut NPR's Aarti Shahani reported that Twitter noted there's no \"magic algorithm\" to identify terrorist content on the Internet, and that it was forced to decide who to ban based on \"very limited information and guidance.\" ",

If you’re a Windows Insider running the latest Movies & TV app version, Microsoft will now let you buy and play these videos from the Windows Store. While Microsoft’s Store previously supported HD and Full HD videos, this is the first time the Store and the corresponding app are now able to support 4K content . \nThat’s not all that’s new in this update, Microsoft has introduced a video cloud collection, analogous to the Groove Music pass collection. You can now sync media you’ve purchased in the app across your Windows and Xbox devices with that. Whole you could do it before with the “restore purchases” button, this makes it slightly easier. \nFor Xbox users, Microsoft is now making it easier to see what percentage of a movie you ‘ve viewed right from the homepage – saving you the proverbial click. \nHere’s the full changelog below: It’s now easier to sync video you’ve purchased in the Movies & TV app across your devices with the introduction of your video cloud collection. When there is a UHD version of a video in our catalogue, you’ll be prompted to purchase or rent the UHD version by default. You can now purchase and rent UHD videos inside the Movies & TV app. On Xbox One consoles, you can see how much of a movie you’ve already watched from your Homepage \nThe update is coming to Windows Insiders first, but will be coming to other Windows 10 users in the coming weeks.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan Microsoft drops its Enterprise Advantage licensing program before it begins Microsoft won't be adding the previously announced Enterprise Advantage option to its licensing line-up, after all, officials are acknowledging. \nIn July, Microsoft announced plans to add a new purchasing option to its Microsoft Products and Services Agreement (MPSA) licensing plan . But even before that new option went live in early 2017, Microsoft apparently has dropped it. \nI discovered the removal of any references to Enterprise Advantage thanks to a Directions on Microsoft tweet on December 5. \n\"References to 'Enterprise Advantage on MPSA' removed from Microsoft.com; widely promoted integration of EA (Enterprise Agreement) with MPSA cancelled,\" said the @On_MS_Licensing account on Twitter. \nAnnounced July 1, Enterprise Advantage on MPSA was meant to bring the traditional Enterprise Agreement terms and offers to MPSA. The coming plan is meant to appeal especially to mid-size organizations who want the option of doing organization-wide purchasing. \nEnterprise Advantage on MPSA was slated to be available to any and all commercial customers in markets where MPSA is available, but was expected to be of particular interest to customers with between 250 to 2,400 users or devices, according to Microsoft. \nMPSA is Microsoft's licensing/purchasing agreement that is meant to enable users to consolidate various licensing contracts into \"a single, nonexpiring agreement for all organizations.\" MPSA was designed to replace software-centric licensing and purchasing agreements with something simpler that would appeal to customers using a mix of Microsoft software and services. \nI asked Microsoft officials why they'd decided to drop Enterprise Advantage. The short answer seems to be Microsoft decided it would add unnecessary complexity. \nHere's the full statement from a spokesperson: \"Our goal is to provide modern licensing choices that enable customers to digitally transform their organizations. We want to accelerate and streamline how we get there. After careful evaluation we decided introducing Enterprise Advantage on MPSA would add more steps for our customers and partners than was necessary. By investing further to enhance all the ways customers want to buy, Microsoft assisted, self-service, and through value-added partner services, we can modernize more quickly and with less change.\"",

      "text": "The European Union has approved a $26bn (£20.5bn) connection request between technology behemoth Microsoft and professional networking site LinkedIn.\n\nThe deal has already received the green light from antitrust authorities in the US, Canada, Brazil and South Africa.\n\nHaving received the go-ahead from the EU’s competition watchdog, the deal is likely to close in the coming days, said Brad Smith Microsoft’s president and chief legal officer.\n\n*Read more*: EU piles pressure onto US tech giants to improve responses to hate speech\n\n“With this regulatory process behind us, we can bring together two great companies and focus on even broader issues for the future,” he said in a blog post.\n\nTo secure EU approval for its largest ever deal, Microsoft will let LinkedIn rivals access its Office add-in programme, crucial for integrating their services with its Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel programmes.\n\nMost of LinkedIn’s $3bn annual revenue is generated from monthly fees from job hunters and recruiters.\n\n*Read more*: Weakened pound: Microsoft is next to increase UK prices\n\nLinkedIn reported a 23 per cent jump in revenue in its results for the third quarter of this year.\n\nLaw firm Morrison & Forrester has said we should expect more major technology takeovers next year, after M&A deals involving flight-booking website Skyscanner, chip designer Arm Holdings and, of course, the Microsoft-LinkedIn tie-up.",

      "text": "last » \nA few years ago, Microsoft partner New Signature was in the same position as many channel partners when it came to the Internet of Things – the company wanted to build out an IoT practice due to the hype, but was unsure of where to begin. \n\"We didn't know where to start,\" David Geevaratne, chief sales officer at the Washington-based solution provider, said at The Channel Company's NextGen conference Tuesday. \"We had heard all the information and seen use cases from niche companies, but we're not a niche player – we're a broad cross-stack on-premises and cloud mobile Microsoft partner. How do we adapt to fit that unique IoT space?\" \nFast forward to today, and the company has a successful IoT solution use case under its belt, an IoT practice and team comprised of analytics and engineering solution specialists, IoT marketing materials and seminars, and a portfolio of analytics offerings for customers. [Related: CompTIA: More Customers Are Looking To Adopt IoT, With Partner Help ] \nThe key, stressed Geevaratne, was to take a step back and look at how the company's existing technology offerings, services and customer base could fit into IoT. \"We leveraged the fact that we had an existing knowledge around technology so we could go to businesses and tell them It's not about devices or things, it's really about analytics,\" he said. \nNew Signature has tapped into the Internet of Things with a sweet solution – helping The Hershey Company wire its existing production equipment. The company helped Hershey save hundreds of thousands of dollars, decrease waste, and create a leaner operation through connecting its infrastructure so that the popular candy – like licorice – could be tracked digitally for weight and other factors at every stage of the production and packaging processes. \nHowever, well before working with Hershey, New Signature had to take a variety of steps to build out its skills and offerings around the Internet of Things. \nTo start, the company created an IoT investment strategy, which outlined a starting point and pinpointed different target goals as part of building an IoT practice. To build out a successful IoT solution, New Signature decided to start with its largest existing customer base and focus on its existing business intelligence and analytics service offerings. \n\"We knew that as a solution provider, we didn't want to go to everybody; we wanted to take care of specific customers in very specific verticals,\" said Geevaratne. \"We wanted to grow organically with our existing capabilities, and we also wanted to use our existing strong Microsoft relationship.\" \nThat relationship was a large driver in New Signature's IoT solution, where data is sent from the machines to the Azure IoT Hub and into the cloud, and analyzed with Microsoft Stream Analytics. New Signature holds a silver-level competency from Microsoft in data analytics and a gold-level competency in cloud platform and cloud productivity. \nAnother important step in planning an Internet of Things strategy was taking a step back and defining what a successful IoT practice would entail in terms of budget and strategy, over the next six months. \nIn New Signature's case, the company established a goal to deliver three IoT strategy projects and one IoT implementation, as well as deliver $500,000 in revenue from analytics projects.

      "text": "EU approves LinkedIn deal after Microsoft makes concessions Regulators okay $26B acquisition with strings that will last five years Senior Writer, Computerworld | Dec 6, 2016 2:35 PM PT Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry There was an error emailing this page. Credit: REUTERS/Dado Ruvic Mingis on Tech: Google rolls out the hardware \nThe European Union's regulators on Tuersday approved Microsoft's acquisition of social network LinkedIn on the condition that the U.S. company abide by several minor concessions it made to secure the deal. \nThe conditions were reminiscent of those forced on Microsoft in past antitrust actions, including the settlement between the firm and the U.S. Justice Department early in the century, and a later judgment against Microsoft in the European Union (EU). \nMicrosoft promised it would not require PC makers to install a LinkedIn app or Windows 10 tile on machines sold in the European Economic Area (EEA), the region consisting of EU member states as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norway. Users will be able to remove any LinkedIn app or tile in Windows, Microsoft said, and pledged that it would not use Windows to nag customers to install a LinkedIn app. \nMicrosoft committed to giving LinkedIn rivals access to the Office Add-in program and the APIs (application programming interfaces) of the Office applications so that competing professional social networks can craft connections between their services and the suite. \nOther social networks will also be able to access Microsoft Graph, the one-stop API portal that stores and retrieves data in Microsoft's cloud services. \nThe EU antitrust regulators were most concerned that Microsoft would integrate LinkedIn with Office, and merge the companies' user databases. \"This could have been reinforced by shutting out LinkedIn's competitors from access to Microsoft's application programming interfaces, which they need to interoperate with Microsoft's products and to access user data stored in the Microsoft cloud,\" the EU Commission wrote in a Tuesday statement. \n\"The Commission was concerned that the increase in LinkedIn's user base would make it harder for new players to start providing professional social network services in the European Economic Area (EEA), the agency continued. \"Furthermore, it could have gradually and irreversibly tipped the market towards LinkedIn in Member States where a competitor of LinkedIn currently operates (such as Austria, Germany or Poland).\" \nAlthough the deal doesn't preclude Microsoft from integrating LinkedIn and Office -- which would effectively negate much of the former's rationale for the $26 billion acquisition -- EU regulators said that they were satisfied that Microsoft's promises would keep a level playing field. \nThe commitments must be honored for five years, the EU said. A trustee, not yet named, will monitor Microsoft's execution of the promises. \nSalesforce, which also coveted LinkedIn , had been the most prominent critic of the acquisition. In September, Salesforce claimed that if the deal went through, Microsoft could \"deny competitors access to [LinkedIn's] data, and in doing so obtain an unfair competitive advantage .\" \nThe EU Commission rejected Saleforce's argument, saying that others' \"access to the full LinkedIn database is not essential to compete on the market.\" \nMore information about the concessions Microsoft made were spelled out in post to a blog by Brad Smith, president and chief legal officer, and a statement issued by EU regulators .

      "text": "Months after the experimental Tay failed after users took advange of its AI-enabled technology to goad the chatbot into spewing offensive comments, Microsoft is trying again with a new chatbot called Zo. Microsoft is giving social chatbots another try several months after the company was forced to pull the plug on an earlier effort called Tay. Like Tay, Zo is powered by the company's artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning technologies to deliver conversational experiences. Unlike Tay, Microsoft appears to be taking a more cautious approach to launching this chatbot. Whereas Tay was set loose on Twitter, Snapchat, GroupMe and Kik in the U.S., Zo is currently only available on Kik, a bot-friendly chat platform. According to MSPoweruser , Zo appears to be based on the Xiaoice chatbot developed for China by Microsoft. Zo is also keeping its guard up.Discovered by Twitter user Tom Hounsell, Microsoft's latest chatbot isn't as easily tricked into making objectionable comments as its predecessor. On March 24, the day after launching Tay, Microsoft shut down the youth-oriented chatbot . Tay was meant to mimic a fun-loving young woman and conduct playful conversations. Instead, users pounced on quirks of Tay's AI-enabled technology to goad the chatbot into spewing racially and politically charged tweets.\"Unfortunately, within the first 24 hours of coming online, we became aware of a coordinated effort by some users to abuse Tay's commenting skills to have Tay respond in inappropriate ways. As a result, we have taken Tay offline and are making adjustments,\" a Microsoft spokesperson told eWEEK at the time. Seemingly learning its lesson, Microsoft has imbued Zo with a more cautious demeanor. For example, when prodded to discuss politics, MSPoweruser noticed that Zo will reply \"people can say some awful things when talking politics so I don't discuss.\" Zo is similarly reluctant to engage when confronted with other NSFW (not safe for work) language and topics. Kik users can take Zo for a spin by visiting this website and requesting an invite from Microsoft. Outside of Microsoft, the industry is banking on chatbots to help improve enterprise collaboration and even help retailers drum up more sales from millennials. In July, Cisco Systems revealed it had teamed with Gupshup to help bring chatbot capabilities to the networking giant's Spark unified communications platform. \"Chatbots are quickly transforming the way we use computers, providing a simpler, easier and conversational interface to advanced services,\" said Beerud Sheth, CEO of Gupship, in a statement. \"Working with Cisco has made it possible for us to expose the enterprise to bots, which will soon transform virtually every business workflow.\" Last month, customer engagement software specialist [24]7 released a survey revealing that millennials are helping to drive the adoption of messaging apps and chatbots in retail . Nearly 40 percent of millennials would consider interacting with a company using a messaging app. Nine percent prefer to interact with a bot rather than a human. Chatbots could also help improve security. Founded by former Intel McAfee engineers, Cupertino, California-based startup Demisto is using bots to help enterprise security operations teams quickly resolve security breaches.",

      "title": "Teaming up against terrorism, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter enter officially the…",
      "text": "Teaming up against terrorism, Facebook, Microsoft, Google and Twitter enter officially the political sphere In a soft public statement , four of the top tech companies in the world — Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and Google — announced Today that they will partner in order to contrast the spread of extremist content on their platforms. In other terms: they are officially entering politics. Holding more capital than many leading Countries, the three companies have means to make an impact. Moreover, free from any political decision making system and bureacratic burden, they can put immediately in practice their intents. Finally, what is even more important after Today’s statement, “Fighting terrorisms” is one of the major concern for citizens (accordingly to polls held during the French primaires de droite in November, it is the priority n°1 ,) and a key point of the agenda of the Country these companies are based in, US. By announcing they will do something about it, they enter the political sphere: although it would be naif to claim they have been completely apart from it so far, it is the first time they are constituting an alliance and putting together concrete measures to tackle a challenge with so many political implications.\nThe pace of the application of this new shared program about ‘dangerous content’ is rocket science compared to the classic political institutions one: the European Commission started discussing it last year at the EU Internet Forum, and yet we have to see the results. Actually, will we ever see them? Worryingly, the Forum seems to involve only industry representatives, excluding civil society representatives and leaving unanswered transparency requests of civil and human rights organisations such as EDRi, prompting an Ombudsman investigation on EU Internet Forum .\nFighting terrorist content is certainly a good cause: social media and the Web played a major role in spreading extreme messages and enrolling new people to the Islamic State cause. But as much as they helped the ‘evil’ part, they also contributed to mobilise people for good causes. The argument is not new: the medium has few responsibilities in front of how people actually use it. Telegram encryption system made impossible to the police to detected Bataclan’s terrorists conversations, but I am still happy I can communicate with the people I care through a truly private application. We are in front of two opposite ethics scenarios, one of complete relativism , where media are just a medium that can’t be controlled in a centralised way without cutting liberty, and consequently these companies should do nothing — or as less as possible — about ‘terrorism’. But this is utopia for the time being, because the second, control through centralisation , is already happening. These companies will elaborate algorithms and launch new departments in charge of terrorisms, and most probably governments will force them to share these data. As much as the European Commission is teaming up with private companies in tackling terrorism, single states initiatives — such as the new UK law about personal data surveillance going under the name of Snoopers’ Charter  — get more pervasives, setting the scene for a new phase. If so far Google collected your data for commercial purposes (direct ones, positioning of ads, but also more subtile ones, like demographics), now it is officially gaining a censorship power over them, with the blessing of the State, which is doing the same on its side.\nWho is entitled to define ‘extremist content’? We have already seen as the task can be differently interpreted by the politicians we voted for, and surely we wouldn’t want some tech companies to do that. We already seen what happened a few months ago, when Facebook censored the famous picture of the girl running away from Napalm bombing because it violated its standards about nudity. We would tend to answer that defining extreme content is common sense, but to common sense (as we “commonly” intend it) most of the claims that make successful Trump or Marine Le Pen are extremists.\nI suspect efforts to limit the widespread of certain messages can not only be superficial (information always find a way, and big tech companies have still a long way to go before controlling the Deep Web as much as they control the Web), but also dangerous now that the biggest companies of the world are sharing data (the biggest currency) among themselves and putting into practice their definition of good and evil.",

      "text": "Print \nAs far as Big Social (YouTube, Facebook , Twitter, Microsoft) is concerned, “extremists” can run but they cannot hide. There will be a sharing of database information so that if, for instance, Twitter identifies a hate group, then Facebook will know as well. This is all well and fine until you get down to the defintion of “extremists.” It will not be long until these liberal run social networks will indentify any vocal conservative group as a hate group. Heck, you can get banned right now for just reporting factual news. Liberal Big Brother just got bigger. \nAs Written By Julia Fioretti for BRUSSELS Reuters: Web giants YouTube , Facebook , Twitter and Microsoft will step up efforts to remove extremist content from their websites by creating a common database. The companies will share ‘hashes’– unique digital fingerprints they automatically assign to videos or photos – of extremist content they have removed from their websites to enable their peers to identify the same content on their platforms. “We hope this collaboration will lead to greater efficiency as we continue to enforce our policies to help curb the pressing global issue of terrorist content online,” the companies said in a statement on Tuesday. Tech companies have long resisted outside intervention in how their sites should be policed, but have come under increasing pressure from Western governments to do more to remove extremist content following a wave of militant attacks. YouTube and Facebook have begun to use hashes to automatically remove extremist content. But many providers have relied until now mainly on users to flag content that violates terms of service. Flagged material is then individually reviewed by human editors who delete postings found to be in violation. Twitter suspended 235,000 accounts between February and August this year and has …..",

      "text": "Microsoft to Close LinkedIn Acquisition Within Days News Analysis Tweet Microsoft says it's cleared its final hurdle for its LinkedIn acquisition after getting regulatory approval from the European Commission. It says it plans to close the $26.2 billion deal within days. \nSalesforce.com Inc. and other Microsoft competitors protested the acquisition, citing concerns that Microsoft Corp. (Nasdaq: MSFT) would gain unfair access to LinkedIn Corp. data. \nAs part of the discussions with the European Commission, Microsoft agreed to restrictions on its LinkedIn integration, according to a blog post Tuesday from Brad Smith, Microsoft president and chief legal officer. Microsoft will continue providing hooks to allow third-party professional social media services to integrate with Office, allow users and IT administrators to opt out of LinkedIn integration, and won't require PC manufacturers to pre-install Windows LinkedIn Applications. \nMicrosoft and LinkedIn announced the acquisition in June, looking to integrate LinkedIn professional information with Microsoft's cloud services. Smith notes that soon afterwards, the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union, and months later, the US Presidential election concluded. \"On both sides of the Atlantic, it has become increasingly apparent that many people feel left out and unable to participate in the economic growth and opportunities created by the rising digital economy,\" Smith says, adding that technology -- including the combined Microsoft and LinkedIn -- can contribute to finding solutions to those problems. \nWant to know more about the cloud? Visit Light Reading Enterprise Cloud . \nThe EU confirms the approval in its own statement , noting that Microsoft is \"a relatively small player\" in CRM, facing \"strong competitors,\" including \"Salesforce, the clear market leader, Oracle and SAP.\" \nIn announcing the acquisition in June, the two companies said they're looking to integrate LinkedIn's professional information with Microsoft's business apps and cloud service to enhance selling, marketing and talent management. LinkedIn will retain its brand and independence, Microsoft said at the time. The companies will integrate LinkedIn's professional relationships' graphs in Outlook, Calendar, Active Directory, Office and more. (See Microsoft & LinkedIn: Marriage Made in the Cloud .) \nPrior to the acquisition announcement, LinkedIn disclosed big plans to transition to a private cloud. The company has not disclosed details on what the acquisition will do to the future of those plans, but recently launched an Oregon data center as part of the strategy. (See Under Microsoft, LinkedIn's Big Cloud Plans Face Uncertain Future and LinkedIn Powers Up Oregon Data Center .) \n— Mitch Wagner,",

      "text": "Microsoft could be getting some more business in the New Year.\nThe business technology colossus debuted Windows 10 in 2015, and now counts 400 million computers running the operating system, according to Microsoft msft .\nHowever, businesses have been slow to upgrade all of their corporate computers to the latest Windows OS in 2016, according to research by IT services and technology company Adaptiva.\nAdaptiva said Tuesday that based on its findings, it believes companies are going to be upgrading to the latest version in 2017. Adaptiva based its findings from a survey it conducted over the summer of 300 IT professionals at various businesses.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nThe company said that 41% of the companies it surveyed have been avoiding the upgrade, and some \"have gone so far as to actively resist the move by using software to prevent or disable Windows 10 installation.\" The survey didn't say why exactly companies were avoiding the upgrade, but the majority of respondents that did upgrade \"rated the Windows 10 migration process to be somewhat to extremely challenging,\" the survey said.\nAdditionally, the survey explained that although companies believe Windows 10 is high-quality software, internal business software compatibility \"remain(s) as large barriers to Windows 10 deployment.\"\nBut apparently, things will be brighter in 2017 when it comes to Windows 10 adoption, with Adaptiva saying that 64% of the survey respondents plan to move to to the new OS in the coming year. The survey didn't specifically cite a major reason for the increase of Windows 10 adoption, but presumably it is because some businesses felt they could no longer avoid the upgrade.\nFor more about Microsoft, watch: \n\nIf businesses decide to stick with older versions of Windows, Adaptiva predicts that Microsoft could encourage adoption by through measures like reducing support for the older Windows versions. That’s the stick, but the carrot of discounts related to Microsoft's Azure cloud computing business service or Office 365 work productivity software could work just as well.",

      "title": "Apple's sky-high prices for its MacBooks have me taking a second look at Microsoft's Surface Pro 4 - CNET",
      "text": "Up Next Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple \nFor the past six months I've been in the market for a new laptop, and like a lot of people, I put off making a purchase until Apple unveiled its redesigned MacBook Pros, which were officially introduced in late October and shipped last month. \nFor those who missed the release, the new MacBook Pros come in entry-level and premium versions. Both are slimmed-down versions of their predecessors -- essentially a MacBook Pro in a MacBook Air chassis with USB-C ports instead of standard USB -- but the premium model has an integrated Touch Bar OLED strip that takes the place of the old-school function keys at the top of the keyboard. \nCNET editor Dan Ackerman gave that MacBook Pro with Touch Bar a 4.5-star rating, calling it a \"Second-screen dream machine\" and thanks to that \"smart, useful Touch Bar,\" the premium model was well worth splurging on over the standard streamlined 13-inch MacBook Pro . \nApple's Touch Bar is a nice touch, but it'll cost you. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nIt's a great machine. I've played around with it. I've touched the Touch Bar. I've looked at this laptop longingly, open and closed. There's only one problem: It starts at $1,800 for the 13-inch model and $2,400 for the 15-inch model, which includes a step-up Core i7 processor and more RAM (16GB) in its base model. It's also worth mentioning that the new entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, sans Touch Bar, starts at $1,500 -- or $200 more than last year's MacBook Pro. \nThese high prices and some heated debate online over the utility of the Touch Bar may have raised some eyebrows, but Apple managed to put up record sales number during the launch windows. \n\"We are proud to tell you that so far our online store has had more orders for the new MacBook Pro than any other pro notebook before,\" Phil Schiller, Apple SVP, told The Independent , a UK publication, on November 2. \nNot surprising, considering that months of rumors of a pending MacBook Pro redesign left plenty of folks -- like me -- holding off on their MacBook purchases. Demand was sky-high. \n(Apple did not respond to CNET's request for follow-up comment on the MacBook Pro's pricing or demand.) \nSelect models of the Surface Pro 4 are frequently on sale. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nWhile I was tempted to bite, I didn't. I felt that if I was going to get a new MacBook Pro, I might as well get the one with the Touch Bar because if I got the standard one I thought there'd always be a little part of me that would wish I'd paid a few hundred bucks more and gotten the extra touch strip. Once you're $1,500 in the hole, you might as well go to $1,800, my reasoning went. \nBut then I thought, \"$1,800 is a lot of money, do I really need to spend that much on a laptop?\" I'm not a graphic designer. Sure, I might do a little editing of family videos, but on the whole, I'm not doing anything that would tax most current laptops -- why not get a lightweight Windows tablet PC with a full touch screen interface that costs significantly less? After all, I'm kind of in the market for an iPad, but with prices for iPads also being high, I haven't bothered to buy a new one (I use an iPad Air that was given to my wife as a gift and still works fine). So, why not combine two purchases into one? \nThen came Black Friday . Best Buy was selling the entry-level Surface Pro 4 with an Intel Core m3 plus a keyboard for $600. By comparison, Apple's beautifully designed m3-powered 12-inch MacBook , which I also had my eye on, starts at $1,300. \nApple's super-svelte 12-inch MacBook is powered by an Intel Core m3 chip and starts at $1,300. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET \nI haven't tried the entry-level version of the Surface Pro 4, but I have tried step-up models with Core i5 and Core i7 chips. I like the Type keyboard cover well enough, although my one gripe is that the integrated touchpad isn't nearly as good as the MacBook's (using a wireless mouse or Surface Pen for navigation is my preference). I may be slightly more partial to Mac OS X, but I'm also a little bored with it, and have never had anything against Windows 10 , so it's all good. \nAm I open to another tablet PC or lightweight convertible PC (a laptop that converts into a tablet)? Microsoft's Surface Book , for example, or something from Lenovo or HP? Sure, but for the moment I've zeroed in on the Surface Pro 4. It's a mature product, on its fourth iteration with presumably a fifth-generation model coming next year, and there are deals to be had on it. \nAs part of its 12 Days of Deals sale, on Thursday, December 8, Microsoft will have the entry-level m3-powered Pro 4 on sale for $649 (with a sleeve but no a keyboard cover) and on Friday, December 16, it's offering a $200 discount on select Pro 4 models, with a free Type Cover thrown in. And I wouldn't be surprised to see post-holiday sales on select Surface Book Pro 4 models. \nI'm not sure that \" Apple just handed Microsoft the keys to the kingdom ,\" as my colleague Sean Hollister wrote shortly after Apple first unveiled the new MacBook Pros. But those high prices on MacBooks have certainly opened the door to folks to look elsewhere for a more-affordable lightweight laptop that has the added appeal of doubling as a tablet. \nIf Microsoft could improve its Windows app store -- and by improve, I mean offer a wider range of cheap apps to compete with Apple's huge selection of iOS apps -- it'd be a no-brainer. However, as it stands, depending on the deal you can get, it may be a jump worth making. Share your voice",

      "text": "Sensei Project Solutions Releases Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Microsoft Project Online in the Microsoft Office Store Share Article New app helps Resource Managers and Project Managers balance resource capacity and demand in a fast and intuitive way in Microsoft Project Online Resource managers can now quickly see bottlenecks across the organization and proactively manage allocations of resources to projects. (PRWEB) December 06, 2016 Sensei Project Solutions announced today the official launch of the Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App for Project Online, which provides support for Microsoft’s new ‘Resource Engagement Model.’ “Resource managers can now quickly see bottlenecks across the organization and proactively manage allocations of resources to projects,” said Kenneth Steiness, CEO of Sensei Project Solutions. “Project managers also benefit, as they can see conflicts for resources assigned to their projects.” Three heatmaps help visualize the balance between resource capacity and demand in a much faster and more intuitive way. Availability Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their capacity. This quickly shows how busy resources are with work from project schedules. Engagement Heatmap - Shows the engagement of resources in relation to their capacity. This allows resource managers to quickly determine the commitment level of resources. Coverage Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their engagements. This allows resource and project managers to ascertain mismatches in resourcing between the project schedules and engagements. When you view the Heatmaps, the coloring immediately draws your attention to problems. As users of Project Online would expect, a single click on the schedule icon will open the Project Desktop client to the relevant schedule, where the problem can be fixed immediately. The Sensei Resource Heatmaps™ App is available for individual users in the Microsoft Office Store, and organizations can purchase an Enterprise license directly from Sensei Project Solutions. About Sensei Project Solutions: Sensei Project Solutions, a Finalist for the 2015 Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) Partner of the Year, focuses on bringing Instant Productivity to your team.

MS Office does not require a password but you will need the SN so you can activate it once installed. The password it's asking for is your Admin password so that it can install and make changes. That's the same password you need anytime a program or driver is installed and makes changes to the system.",

      "title": "Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Smartphone Market",
      "text": "Home Technology Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Smartphone Market Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Smartphone Market 3 \nMicrosoft has always treated its Windows Surface Phone with many surprises, but now news has surfaced that points to rumors that the company itself is now planning to eliminate some devices with the official retirement of the Lumia lineup. \nWe recently reported news about the HP Elite X3, and users say it’s the best Windows phone to date, and not even a Lumia can match its performance. It’s kind of ironic that the number one Windows phone is not manufactured by Microsoft, but Redmond itself said on several occasions that it plans to work with partners on building “great devices.” \nBut despite the HP Elite X3 being a hardware monster, the software side of the device is simply dragging it down, and I’m saying this as a big fan of Windows phones. It’s nearly impossible to come from Android or iOS and be happy with Windows phones (although I’ve personally seen people doing this, but you can count them on the fingers of one hand), and there are three main reasons for this. \nSpoiler alert: Windows phone fans aren’t going to like this, but as always, head to the comment section if you think I’m wrong. I’m preparing my argument bag as we speak, so let’s have a conversation. \nNews of Buggy operating system \nWindows 10 Mobile phone has improved a lot since the first preview builds were released a long time ago, but after using it for so long on the Lumia 950 XL and then on the HP Elite X3, it’s more than obvious that it still has a long way to go before it becomes a strong rival to Android and iOS. \nBugs are still there, and it goes without saying that these easily ruin the experience with a powerful phone like the HP Elite X3. The “Resuming” bug is still there, and so are crashes that occur every once in a while when using various apps. Mary Smith Dec 06, 2016 10 thoughts on “ Surface Phone For Microsoft Windows Could Compete With Smartphone Market ” Curtis Quick November 29, 2016 at 7:14 pm \nI have been using Windows 10 Mobile for 2 years now and I have been very satisfied with its performance and capabilities. Aside from the infamous lack of 3rd party apps (that I don’t use) what shortcomings have you experienced with Windows 10 Mobile compared to the iOS and Android experience? \nOne of the things I like most about Windows 10 Mobile is that it serves me well as an at-a-glance notepad. I put all kinds of notes on the tiles and don’t have to open apps to read them. I also use it that way for the calendar, alarms, and email. It’s all just right there on the home screen. I do not believe this is currently possible on iOS and Android. November 30, 2016 at 7:35 pm \nI’ve been using my 950XL for 9 months (Since late Feb 2016) and after it’s first major update have had zero issues with it. It’s solid, fast and just works and works. I’m very happy to have left Android. As an IT pro, who has been working with this stuff for a long time, I don’t understand the sturm & drang over this OS. It essentially works like my other Windows 10 devices. Could it be that I do not play games on any of my devices, which could exercise the hardware more than the normal business apps I use daily? I can’t answer that. But for the serious work I do daily, I have absolutely zero complaints. December 1, 2016 at 12:09 am \nI’ve been using windows phones for about two years now and that was out of necessity due to office suite running better on these phones than any other and the price was better, I don’t like paying 700 for a phone, I got my windows phone from Microsoft for 150, does everything I need it to do. App’s? Apps seem to be dying, I use apps less and less, most websites are mobile optimized and I can get full function on my windows phone and I see that trend continuing. Plus apps just cram up your storage and drag your battery down. I do hate to see that Microsoft will eliminate the lumia phones that were affordable, as mentioned I don’t like to pay 700 for a phone but if I have to I will because I have never been a fan of Apple, and Samsung just got to be more than I needed with their Galaxy phones which I used for many years starting with the first Galaxy which I purchased when I left being a Blackberry user. Why didn’t Microsoft buy Blackberry instead of Nokia? That seems like a better fit since Microsoft is largely an enterprise level company and Blackberry to this day is still a champion of governments for their encryption abilities and they were synonymous with productivity prior to Apple dominating the smartphone landscape but Apple in my opinion is not a business or government phone its a fancy consumer device as is most Android devices although the higher end Android devices in combination with Google Docs is a fairly productive and worthy business phone, especially with their mapping. But I’ll stick with Windows phones now, I like the simple OS, three main screens makes it easy to navigate, Android is hit or miss depending on the manufacturer and what their spin on the OS is, I particularly dislike several major brands versions of Android and the calling features some of them use make it difficult to simply answer the phone. I hope Microsoft doesn’t allow other manufacturers to start screwing with their OS for phones when it has taken them forever to finally get this close to being where they should have been ten years ago when the then CEO was not Bill Gates that much is obvious, the new CEO of Microsoft has a good vision for the company and their productivity suite is still the best although google docs will get the job done for most people it is as far behind Office as Windows phones OS is behind Android in terms of absolute ability. But the new surface phone looks like it will erase that divide in one fast swoop, but I do not see the surface phone or Microsoft ever gaining more than 10% of the market without an entry level phone to attract young users and indoctrinate them to the Microsoft universe.",

      "text": "Home Technology Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon RAM Processor’ Windows Surface Phone by Microsoft Comes With ‘Snapdragon RAM Processor’ 2 \nMicrosoft is already planning to release Windows Surface Phone models with the release date likely happening in the latter part of 2017, prototypes of the device reportedly leaked out and revealed that the Windows 10 mobile handset will run on Snapdragon 835 SoC with up to 6GB of RAM support. \nMicrosoft, according to tech blog site NokiaPowerUser, is currently testing two prototypes of the Surface Phone, which the report said will be finalized boasting of 5.5-inch Quad HD display. Firing up the handsets is Qualcomm’s next-generation SD 835 that in recent reports was described as the first processor to be produced in 10-nanometer process that promises more mobile computing power with increased efficiency of energy use. With SD 835 on board, the upcoming Surface Phone is tipped to mighty up with 8-core Kryo 200 CPU and Adreno 540 GPU. \nOne of the Microsoft Windows Surface Phone prototypes, the same report said, will top with 6GB of RAM for sufficient support of desktop functionalities. NokiaPowerUser said that this model is able to run X86 apps in Continuum, a built-in feature of Windows 10 that creates a desktop setting on a mobile device when connected with a monitor. \n“We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps,” the report said. \nThe other prototype has also SD 835 as the main engine but with only 4GB of RAM support, indicating that Microsoft has designed the Surface Phone for two key users – the 6GB RAM model will be for enterprise while the one with lower RAM will be for general consumers. \nThe latter, according to NokiaPowerUser, will run in 64-bit Windows 10 Mobile OS but without Continuum functionality. While Nadella has talked about the Surface Phone recently, teasing that the device is both unique and a game-changer in the making, he stopped short of revealing the juicy details such as basic specifications and possible release timing. \nHowever, the NokiaPowerUser report is speculating that the Surface Phone release date will happen immediately after the Windows 10 Redstone 3 Update rollout or in the last few months of 2017, and possibly unboxing with the rumored Surface Pro 5.

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone Features Microsoft Surface Phone Introduces Windows Surface Phone Features \nThere’s been a lot of information being said about Microsoft’s latest Surface Phone \nProtos Display Size, processor, RAM, OS emerge from our sources. A bit of information about the latest Surface Phone photos emerge from our trusted sources yet again. There are more than one Surface Phone protos in testing at Microsoft and here is what we have learned, \nSurface Phone Specs & features: The protos that we have information about run Snapdragon 835 and support Quick charging 4.0 Windows 10 Mobile architecture on them is already 64-Bit and one of them has 6 GB RAM What is most interesting is the information that the one proto with 6 GB RAM can already run X86 apps in Continuum. We have heard a lot about Microsoft working on X86-on-ARM64 emulation and this may be one of the implementations. Sources however tell us that Protos can’t run X86 apps by themselves yet, but can install them. Once connected via Continuum you can run any X86 apps. The earlier reported Laptop Accessory is still a thing and we hear Microsoft is seriously purusing the 3-in-1 form factor. One of the Protos is said to have 4 GB RAM and still runs Snapdragon 835. It does have 64-Bit Windows 10 Mobile version but can’t run X86 apps in Continuum. That may be just a version thing or Microsoft may be planing one consumer and one enterprise-oriented Surface Phone variant. Display-size wise we hear both are said to have a 5.5-inch, QHD display, but this is just a guess having a look at the display and not actual measurement. \nRedstone 3 and Release Date: Protos of-course run a Windows 10 Mobile version from different branch. Redstone 3 will be relatively much bigger update than Redstone 2. For Redstone 3 development cycle Windows team is prioritizing Mobile as Windows 10 development target. Our sources have confirmed that Surface Phone launch is delayed now to late 2017. It will now come running Windows 10 Mobile focused Redstone 3 out of the box. \nThis info comes from one of our trusted sources with good accuracy. But Companies have been known to launch different configurations than seen on protos in retail products. Also features vary with OS versions and final release OS version may or may not have all the features seen in protos.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro Version 5, Studio Shipping In Spring Microsoft Surface Phone, Windows Pro Version 5, Studio Shipping In Spring 3 \nThe Microsoft Surface Phone news is determined to be the ultimate mobile device, which people are waiting to preorder. With Windows, Pro 5 and Microsoft Studio, the company is heading into a direction that will make its products hot, and some skeptics say Amazon might be the way to order the Surface Phone once a shipping date has been announced. \nIt’s been a depressing year for many Windows 10 Mobile fans, with our dreams of a new frontier of W10M hardware being shot down at every turn. \nThis week’s events, however, give us reason to hope again. In an interview with the Australian Financial Review, Satya Nadella said “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” This could mean a million different things, but news later in the week has us excited about its implications. \nPossible Microsoft Surface Phone specs leak \nThis is what got us buzzing about what seemed to be a passing comment from Satya Nadella. Not long after that interview, we got information about the possible specifications of the Surface Phone. \nIf the leak is to be believed, we’re looking at a Snapdragon 835 processor, 6 GB of RAM, and a 5.5 inch display. This is all supposedly from prototypes, though, so we wouldn’t put too much stock in the specifics. The leak tells us that the Surface Phone is slated for a late 2017 release, looking to line up with Redstone 3. \nMicrosoft looks to implement new “NEON” design language with Redstone 3 \nHere’s one that Windows 10 Mobile users across all devices can get excited about. NEON seems like it’s going to be Microsoft’s new design language, giving Windows 10 a fresh new look. \nThe project is being referred to in some circles as “Metro 2.0,” because it’s going to be trying to accomplish the same sort of interface revolution that Metro accomplished. \nWe don’t know much about how NEON is going to behave, but we do know that it’s supposedly very fluid, and focuses greatly on animation as a key point. Whether or not NEON is an internal codename or the shipping name for the feature is yet to be seen. \nShare improvements coming soon to Insider builds \nThere are plenty of people who seem to have problems with Windows 10’s limitations to sharing. One disgruntled Twitter user went to Twitter to complain, and got a response from Microsoft’s Peter Skillman saying that “Share improvements [are] coming to WIP builds soon.” \nWe don’t have any specifics about what these improvements are going to be, or how significant they’re going to be, but hopefully they address some of the issues people are complaining about. \nThanks for joining us. If you want all of the news as it happens, keep an eye on our Windows 10 Mobile articles.",

Far more Americans shopped online than in stores over the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend. \nA survey released by the National Retail Federation and Prosper Insights & Analytics estimates that some 122 million Americans will shop online on Cyber Monday. That’s up only slightly from last year’s 121 million shoppers. \nBut the increase is notable coming off the Thanksgiving-Black Friday weekend that saw 108.5 million people shop online, well above the 99.1 million who hit stores. What’s more, major retailers, notably Walmart WMT 0.56% started their Cyber Monday sales way earlier than in preceding years, lest they cede a millimeter of the market to Amazon.com . \nIn much the same way Black Friday, as an event, ended up being diluted by Thanksgiving store openings (that started in 2011) and deals starting earlier in November, Cyber Monday is losing some of its impact as a one-day event. In addition to Walmart and Amazon’s deals being spread out, Target is offering discounts on Sunday as well, not only online but, more crucially, in stores. That move, which reflects how people shop in the year 2016, is also meant to lower stress on Target’s web page, which last year buckled under the intense e-commerce pressures that come hand in hand with Cyber Monday . \nThe evidence of the migration of shopping to e-commerce is incontrovertible: Adobe told Fortune on Sunday that e-commerce sales between Thanksgiving and Saturday rose 17.3% to top $7.2 billion. \nWithin e-commerce, a key shift is continuing: some 28 million of those shoppers plan to shop Cyber Monday deals from their phones, continuing a trend that explains why the likes of Walmart, J.C. Penney JCP -1.43% and Kohl’s KSS -1.30% have invested heavily in their mobile shopping apps. \n“The brick-and-mortar retailers have made a big leap with their online efforts this year,” Moody’s analyst Charlie O’Shea told Fortune this weekend.”They’re really getting it.” And they need to: as Fortune reported on Friday, Amazon has said it is featuring 75,000 deals during the week of Cyber Monday. \nWalmart says 60% of Black Friday sales event orders placed on Walmart.com came from mobile devices, something the company says shows customers are growing more comfortable with pushing the “buy” button on smartphones. That retailer has been trying to hook people away from Amazon onto its shopping and mobile payment apps. Walmart has a lot riding on Cyber Monday: It recently finished an overhaul of its marketplace business, something that has allowed it to nearly triple its product assortment in the last year (and offer many items it would never offer in store, like Michael Kors KORS 0.66% handbags). \nOf course, all stores have been stress testing their websites to make sure they can withstand what will be an extraordinary amount of traffic on Monday. That’s for good reason–the security firm Upguard recently estimated that just ten minutes of downtime could translate to a loss of over $2 million in sales.",

      "text": "Home Technology Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Winter 2017 Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Winter 2017 Michael Stevens Dec 06, 2016 Technology Comments Off on Microsoft Surface Studio; Windows Surface Pre-orders To Ship Winter 2017 1 \nMicrosoft said it is shipping Surface Studio orders earlier than expected, as the company originally planned to ship units in mid-December. But Microsoft has been emailing the first people to preorder the $3,000 device, letting them know the Studio will arrive this week. Microsoft is still accepting “preorders” for the Surface Studio, but new devices won’t ship until 2017. \nIf you’re shelling out $3000 or more for a new computer, you’re going to want to receive some pretty good customer service if something happens to goes wrong — and that’s exactly what Microsoft is hoping to deliver to Surface Studio owners with its new support hotline. \nCustomers will be able to call the dedicated phone line with any questions, comments or concerns they have about their computer, which is a service I’m sure will be appreciated by many early adopters as — like any new device — the Surface Studio is bound to suffer from a couple of minor teething problems. \nSo why are we only finding out about the new support platform now? Well, it’s been revealed by Thurrott that Microsoft has already started shipping the Surface Studio to customers who pre-ordered a unit on the first day of availability, and they’ve reportedly received the phone number by email. \nIf you like the sound of the Surface Studio but haven’t got round to placing an order yet, you’ll probably be glad to hear that Microsoft is still accepting “pre-orders” for the device. Unfortunately, they won’t start shipping until early next year. As for an exact date, your guess is as good as ours.",

When alerted, we take swift action against this kind of content in accordance with our respective policies,” said a statement released Monday by the social media firms. The companies said they will create a shared industry database of unique digital fingerprints, called hashes, for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that were removed from their services.\n“By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms,” the statement said.\nSocial media has become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State terror group and others.\nThe companies said they would start by sharing the “most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services.”\nThey added: “We are committed to protecting our users’ privacy and their ability to express themselves freely and safely on our platforms. We also seek to engage with the wider community of interested stakeholders in a transparent, thoughtful and responsible way as we further our shared objective to prevent the spread of terrorist content online while respecting human rights.”\nThe companies said they will each apply their own policies and definitions of terrorist content when deciding whether to remove content. Each also will apply its own “practice of transparency and review for any government requests, as well as retain its own appeal process for removal decisions and grievances.”\nThe program is expected to begin early next year. The companies said they would look to add other firms to the collaboration in the future.\n ",

      "title": "Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update Will Go All-In on Security",
      "text": "Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update Will Go All-In on Security Microsoft's Windows 10 Creators Update Will Go All-In on Security 10 Comments Just one month after patching 68 Windows 10 security vulnerabilities, Microsoft drops a raft of new enterprise security features. \nMicrosoft has unveiled Windows 10 Creators update features focused specifically on security advancements for enterprise customers and IT administrators. New features include a centralized security management portal that integrates with third-party security platforms, updates to Windows Defender Advanced Threat protection, and enhanced mobile application management for employee-owned devices. \nWhen Microsoft unveiled its Windows 10 Creators Update in October, the company was making an obvious play at professional designers, creative hobbyists, and businesses willing to experiment with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The update hinted at a future in which consumers would be able to pull a photo of an armoire from an e-commerce website, convert it into a three-dimensional life-size image, and project a hologram of it into their bedrooms in order to determine if it's the right fit and style before purchasing it. Companies would be able to offer virtual tours of showroom floors. You could browse the stores at a mall in Dubai and make purchases without ever leaving your couch in Des Moines. The revolutionary technology would enable businesses to make this possible, Microsoft claimed. But would businesses bite? \nShortly after the launch of Windows 10 in July of last year, Gartner Research predicted that 50 percent of businesses would begin Windows 10 adoption by January 2017. A February 2016 survey from system management company Adaptiva was even more bullish, with 63 percent of business respondents saying they expected to deploy Windows 10 by the end of 2016. Unfortunately for Microsoft, some early reports claimed actual (not intended) business adoption was as low as one percent, while other more optimistic surveys pegged the actual adoption rate at 38 percent . Microsoft, which does not reveal actual enterprise adoption stats, said in a statement that adoption had escalated 300 percent over the past six months. \nIn order to get buy-in from enterprises, Microsoft has gone to great efforts to try to secure Windows 10. Unfortunately, the operating system (OS) continues to suffer exploits that leave Windows 10 and its apps open to manipulation. Last month, the company patched 68 flaws, two of which had been exploited by hackers. Those patches join a long list of updates and fixes that the company has configured in order to make the system as airtight as possible. Windows Security Center \nWindows Security Center, which was released for Windows 10 in July, will be able to link back to the Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection suite in order to let IT admins track security events across the Windows ecosystem. Combined with new detection, third-party integrations, and the ability to isolate machines and quarantine files, these new features are designed to deliver faster, more comprehensive security procedures for organizations running across the Windows 10 ecosystem. More specifically, IT admins will be able to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications that indicate potential kernel exploits. Teams can feed third-party intelligence into the Windows Security Center for alerts on activities for an additional layer of insight. Once attacks are confirmed, IT can isolate infected machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes, and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center, according to a Microsoft statement. Better Device Management \nMicrosoft will also begin to roll out new insights to the Windows Analytics dashboard that are designed to let IT managers handle device telemetry for device upgrades, updates, and health processes. The update will also automate Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) conversion for legacy BIOS on Windows 7. Rather than re-partition the disc and reconfigure the firmware in order to convert to UEFI, Microsoft has built a tool that will automatically handle the conversion. \nIT will now be able to protect data on personal devices without having to enroll the device in a mobile device management (MDM) program . IT will be able to apply policies to business-specific apps in order to secure corporate information, without having to manage an employee's entire device. \nWhether or not these updates can lure reluctant businesses to Windows 10 remains to be seen. However, the updates address the concerns of businesses that have struggled with the unknown risks of migrating to a relatively new OS.",

      "text": "How to Work With Excel Math Formulas (Guide to the Basics) Advertisement Microsoft Excel Microsoft Office Spreadsheets How-To \nIt's hard to get excited about learning math. It's something that most of us spend our lives avoiding. It's also one of the best reasons to use Microsoft Excel for perfect calculations, every time. \nDon't think of these Excel formulas as math for math's sake. Instead, imagine how these formulas can help you automate your life and skip the trouble of making manual calculations. At the end of this tutorial, you'll have the skills you need to do all of the following, for example: Calculate the average score of your exams. Quickly subtotal the invoices you've issued to clients. Use basic statistics to review a set of data for trends and indicators. \nYou don't have to be an accountant to master math in Excel, however. To follow along with this tutorial, make sure to download the example Excel workbook here or click on the blue Download Attachment button on the right side of this tutorial—in either case it's free to use. \nThe Excel workbook has comments and instructions for how to use these formulas. As you follow along in this tutorial, I'll teach you some of the essential \"math\" skills. Let's get started. Basic Excel Math Formulas Video (Watch and Learn) \nIf learning from a screencast video is your style, check out the video below to walk through the tutorial. Otherwise, keep reading for a detailed description of how to work with each Excel math formula. Formula Basics \nBefore we get started, let's look at how to use any formula in Microsoft Excel. Whether you're working with the math formulas in this tutorial or any others, these tips will help you master Excel. 1. Each Formula in Excel Starts with \"=\" \nTo type a formula, click in any cell in Microsoft Excel and type the equals sign on your keyboard. This starts a formula. Every basic Excel formula starts with the equals sign, and then the formula itself. \nAfter the equals sign, you can put an incredible variety of things into the cell. Try typing =4+4 as your very first formula, and press enter to return the result. Excel will output 8 , but the formula is still behind the scenes in the spreadsheet. 2. Formulas are Shown in Excel's Formula Bar \nWhen you're typing a formula into a cell, you can see the results of the cell once you press enter. But when you select a cell, you can see the formula for that cell in the formula bar. Click on a cell in Excel to show the formula in it, such as the multiplication formula that evaluates to 125. \nTo use the example from above, the cell will show \"8\" , but when we click on that cell, the formula bar will show that the cell is adding 4 and 4. 3. How to Build a Formula \nIn the example above, we typed a simple addition formula to add two numbers. But, you don't have to type numbers, you can also reference other cells. \nExcel is a grid of cells, with the columns running left to right, each assigned a letter, while the rows are numbered. Each cell is an intersection of a row and a column. The cell where column A and row 3 intersect is called A3, for example. Excel formulas can be written to use the values in multiple cells, such as multiplying A1 and B1 to get the value in C1, which is 125. \nLet's say that I have two cells with simple numbers, like 1 and 2, and they are in cells A2 and A3. When I type a formula, I can start the formula with \"=\" as always . Then, I can type: \n=A2+A3 \n...to add those two numbers together. It's very common to have a sheet with values, and then a separate sheet where calculations are performed. Keep all of these tips in mind while working with this tutorial. For each of the formulas, you can reference cells, or directly type numerical values into the formula. \nIf you need to change a formula that you've already typed, double click on the cell. You'll be able to adjust the values in the formula. Arithmetic in Excel \nNow we'll cover Excel math formulas and walk through how to use them. Let's start off by exploring the basic arithmetic formula. These are the foundation of math operations. 1. Add and Subtract \nAddition and subtraction are two essential math formulas in Excel. Whether you're adding up your list of business expenses for the month or balancing your checkbook digitally, the addition and subtraction operators are incredibly useful. \nUse the tab titled \"Add and Subtract\" in the workbook for practice. Add Values \nor, reference values in cells with: \n=A2+A3 Tip: try adding five or six values to see what happens. Separate each item with a plus sign. Adding values in Excel is as easy as typing two numbers and a \"+\" sign, or adding two cell references. Subtract Values \nor, reference values in cells with: \n=A3-A2 Subtract two values in Excel by typing numbers directly in a box, separated with \" -\" sign, or reference two cells with the \" -\" sign between them. 2. Multiplication \nTo multiply values, use the * operator. Use multiplication instead of adding the same item over and over. \nUse the tab titled \"Multiply\" in the workbook for practice. \nExample: \nor, reference values in cells with: \n=A2*A3 Multiplication in Excel uses the * symbol between two values or cell references. 3. Division \nDivision is helpful when splitting items into groups, for example. Use the \"/\" operator to divide numbers or the values in cells in your spreadsheet. \nUse the tab titled \"Divide\" in the workbook for practice. \nExample: \nor, reference values in cells with: \n=A5/B2 Divide values in excel with the / operator, either with values in a formula or between two cells. Basic Statistics \nUse the tab titled \"Basic Statistics\" in the workbook for practice. \nNow that you know the basic math operators, let's move onto something more advanced. Basic statistics are helpful to review a set of data and to make informed judgments about it. Let's cover several popular, simple statistic formulas. 1. Average \nTo use an average formula in Excel, open your formula with =AVERAGE( and then input your values. Separate each number with a comma. When you press enter, Excel will calculate and output the average. \n=AVERAGE(1,3,5,7,10) \nThe best way to calculate an average is to input your values into separate cells in a single column. \n=AVERAGE(A2:A5) Use the =AVERAGE formula to average a list of values separated by commas, or a set of cells as the bottom example shows. 2. Median \nThe median of a data set is the value that's in the middle. If you took the numerical values and ordered them from smallest to largest, the median would be smack dab in the middle of that list. \n=MEDIAN(1,3,5,7,10) \nI'd recommend typing your values into a list of cells, and then using the median formula over a list of cells with values typed in them. \n=MEDIAN(A2:A5) Use the =MEDIAN formula to find the middle value in a list of values when you separate them with commas, or use the formula on a list of cells with values in them. 3. Min \nIf you have a set of data and want to keep your eye on the smallest value, the MIN formula in Excel is useful. You can use the MIN formula with a list of numbers, separated by commas, to find the lowest value in a set. This is very useful when working with large datasets. \n=MIN(1,3,5,7,9) \nYou might want to find the minimum value in a list of data, which is totally possible with a formula such as: \n=MIN(A1:E1) Use the Excel MIN formula with a list of values separated by commas, or with a range of cells to monitor the lowest value in the set. 4. Max \nThe MAX formula in Excel is the polar opposite of MIN ; it tells you which value in a set is the largest. You can use it with a list of numbers, separated by commas: \n=MAX(1,3,5,7,9) \nOr, you can select a list of values in cells, and have Excel return the largest in the set, with a formula like this: \n=MAX(A1:E1) The Excel MAX formula is very similar to MIN, but will help you keep an eye on the largest value in a set, and can be used on a comma separated list of values or data list. Recap and Keep Learning \nI hope this Excel math formulas tutorial helped you think more about what Excel can do for you. With enough practice, your Excel skills will soon seem more natural than grabbing a calculator or doing math on paper. Spreadsheets capture data, and formulas help us understand or modify that data. The operations can be basic, but are at the foundation of important spreadsheets in every company. \nIt's always a great idea to use one tutorial to launch more learning. Here are some suggestions For more advanced math in equation-like formats, Microsoft's official documentation has a page titled \" Insert or edit an equation or expression .\" Tuts+ instructor Bob Flisser has a nice tutorial on calculating percentages in Excel. \nWhat are some other math skills that you use in Excel?

      "text": "Good news and bad news. (Reuters/Lucas Jackson) Share Joon Ian Wong 1 hour ago \nThe European Union’s competition regulator has green-lit Microsoft’s $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn . The decision is both a rebuff to Salesforce’s Marc Benioff, who pushed for a probe to be opened into the deal, but also a sign that Microsoft’s sales-lead management business is no threat to Benioff’s company—at least for now. \nBenioff lost out on buying LinkedIn when he got Salesforce to pursue the social network for workers , once Microsoft stepped in with an offer that Salesforce in no position to match, as Benioff complained to board member Colin Powell . \nBenioff then tried to scupper the union by asking regulators in the US and Europe to probe the deal for competition abuses. Benioff’s theory was that Microsoft would use LinkedIn’s data against competitors , potentially threatening Salesforce’s core business of selling software to manage sales leads, also known as customer-relationship management software or CRM. \nThe US competition authority declined to take Benioff up on it and quickly cleared the deal, but the European Union’s top anti-trust cop, Margrethe Vestager, opened a probe. Vestager is taking on the world’s biggest tech companies on multiple fronts, ranging from Apple’s opaque tax dealings in Ireland to three anti-trust actions against Google . If anyone was going to scrutinize the Microsoft deal, it would be Vestager. \nThe commission’s decision analyzed the competition between Salesforce and Microsoft’s Dynamics unit, and it was brutal in its assessment of Microsoft’s weakness. One scenario for competition abuse is for Microsoft to force LinkedIn business customers to also buy Dynamics software. On this count, the EU found that “LinkedIn … does not appear to be a ‘must-have’ solution.” \nAnother area of possible abuse is for Microsoft to deny competitors access to the all the information in the LinkedIn database, cutting off their ability to develop CRM products based on LinkedIn data. The EU decided that “access to the full LinkedIn database is not essential to compete on the market.” \nIn sum, the commission said, Microsoft is a “relatively small player” in the CRM market, compared with “clear leader” Salesforce and other players, like Oracle and SAP. \nVestager’s team has ok’d the deal with a few conditions, like making sure Microsoft doesn’t force PC-makers to pre-install LinkedIn. (Indeed, the last time Microsoft bundled software aggressively, it didn’t end well .) Read full story",

Sergei Konkov/TASS Up Next Samsung scores unanimous Supreme Court win over Apple \nThe European Union has given its blessing to Microsoft's pending $26 billion acquisition of professional-networking site LinkedIn, the software giant said Tuesday. \nThe European Commission, the EU's executive body, granted its approval on the condition that Microsoft allows rival professional networking sites to integrate its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. PC makers in the EU will also have the option of not installing LinkedIn's app, Microsoft said. \nMicrosoft made the commitments in November after EU regulators expressed antitrust concerns about the deal. The acquisition is now expected to close in coming days, Brad Smith, Microsoft's chief legal officer, wrote in a company blog post . \nMicrosoft announced plans in June to buy LinkedIn for $26.2 billion , its biggest-ever acquisition. For Microsoft, the LinkedIn deal furthers its plan to become an essential provider to businesses of cloud-based services, including its Office 365. Salesforce was also reportedly interested in making a bid for LinkedIn. \nMicrosoft submitted its LinkedIn acquisition for EU regulatory approval in October , after already receiving approval from authorities in the US, Canada and Brazil.

      "title": "Windows 10 'Creators Update' To Bring Security Enhancements",
      "text": "By Kurt Mackie 12/06/2016 \nMicrosoft is planning to deliver some added security improvements for organizations when the Windows 10 \"Creators Update\" gets released. \nThe Windows 10 Creators Update was announced in October as a coming feature update to the operating system that will deliver creative tools support for applications, such as 3D and augmented-reality support. Today, Microsoft described some security improvements that also will be arriving with this release. \nMicrosoft hasn't indicated exactly when the Creators Update will arrive, but it's expected to arrive perhaps in March 2017 as Windows 10 version 1703 (the so-called \"Redstone 2\" release), according to this story by long-time Microsoft reporter Mary Jo Foley. That arrival date was confirmed by her unnamed \"sources,\" she said. \nMultiple security enhancements were announced today by Microsoft with the coming Windows 10 Creators Update. Details were missing regarding availability across Windows 10 product editions, as well as licensing details. \nSome of the improvements, though, involve Microsoft's Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service, which is still at the testing phase since its announcement back in March . Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection is a post-breach security analysis service that Microsoft plans to sell as part of its top-of-the-line Secure Product Enterprise E5 subscription offering. The E5 subscription dependency is shown in the table at the bottom of this page . Microsoft's Secure Productive Enterprise offerings, which are coming into effect this quarter, combine licensing for Office 365 services, the Windows 10 Enterprise edition and the Enterprise Mobility + Security suite bundle, as described back in July . \nThat said, here are the security improvements that are planned for the Windows 10 Creators Update, without licensing details. \nWindows Security Center. The Windows Security Center apparently is a new \"centralized portal\" for showing security events. It will link with Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection , an Exchange Online e-mail security protection service that uses underlying Microsoft Intelligent Security Graph technology. The Windows Security Center will let IT pros track attacks \"across endpoints and email,\" Microsoft's announcement explained. The announcement added that the Windows Security Center \"was first released in the Anniversary Update\" (version 1607). However, it didn't show up on Microsoft's TechNet list of new features for that release. \nWindows Defender Advanced Threat Protection. Microsoft plans to add detection, intelligence and remediation capabilities to this service with the Windows 10 Creators Update. As mentioned above, the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection service analyzes security breaches after they've occurred. It's not the same thing as the Windows Defender antimalware service built into Windows 10, despite the similar name. However, the service is going beyond being just an analysis tool. Microsoft is planning to add remediation support to this service, too. It will be possible with the Creators Update \"to isolate machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center,\" Microsoft's announcement promised. In addition, Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection will have access to sensors in the Creators Update operating system to detect \"threats that persist only in memory or kernel level exploits.\" Lastly, it will be possible for IT pros to add \"their own intelligence into the Windows Security Center.\" This last point went unexplained. Possibly it'll involve sharing a computing environment's data in some way. \nWindows Analytics. Microsoft's announcement was a bit vague on this feature, but apparently Windows Analytics is associated with Windows Upgrade Analytics (called \"Microsoft Upgrade Analytics\" in Microsoft's announcement). Windows Upgrade Analytics is an operating system deployment planning tool that's part of Operations Management Suite subscriptions, but it can be used as a standalone tool with a free Azure subscription for Enterprise customers, according to a talk by Michael Niehaus , director of product marketing for Windows. With the Windows 10 Creators Update, there will be an updated Windows Analytics dashboard. This updated dashboard will permit \"organizations to use their own telemetry to provide new insights and ensure compliance on the upgrade, update and device health processes within their organizations,\" Microsoft's announcement stated. Details were omitted. \nUEFI In-Place Conversion. The Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) is the BIOS replacement found in new PCs. Organizations may have PCs that support UEFI, but they may have put Windows 7 on them and used the traditional BIOS instead. Microsoft plans to deliver an ability with the Windows 10 Creators Update to convert these machines to UEFI as part of the in-place upgrade process from Windows 7. The conversion tool can be used with System Center Configuration Manager. It's not clear from Microsoft's announcement if other tools will be able to take advantage of this UEFI conversion facility. \nMobile Application Management. Microsoft will provide a feature in the Windows 10 Creators Update that \"will protect data on personal devices without requiring the device to be enrolled in a Mobile Device Management solution.\" A video accompanying Microsoft's announcement showed an information protection type of capability. For instance, the copying of text from a work application into a personal application was prevented. It also showed access getting blocked after an employee termination. Details about this capability weren't described. \nWindows Update Size Improvements. Microsoft plans to reduce the size of its updates with the Windows 10 Creators Update. A \"differential download\" technology promises a 35 percent reduction in file size. Improvements to \"express updates\" using System Center Configuration Manager could \"reduce the monthly update size by up to 90%,\" Microsoft suggested. These size reductions are part of a coming \"Unified Update Platform\" technology, Microsoft previously indicated . Niehaus had suggested that a Windows 10 feature update could be reduced from 3.5GB to 2.5GB under this approach. Monthly updates could be reduced to around 1.8GB in size, he added. \nExact timing wasn't described, but previews of some of these Creators Update improvements are expected to show up for Windows Insider Program testers \"over the next few weeks,\" Microsoft indicated.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Microsoft Could See a Boost in Windows 10 Sales in 2017 \nMicrosoft could be getting some more business in the New Year. \nThe business technology colossus debuted Windows 10 in 2015, and now counts 400 million computers running the operating system, according to Microsoft msft . \nHowever, businesses have been slow to upgrade all of their corporate computers to the latest Windows OS in 2016, according to research by IT services and technology company Adaptiva. \nAdaptiva said Tuesday that based on its findings, it believes companies are going to be upgrading to the latest version in 2017. Adaptiva based its findings from a survey it conducted over the summer of 300 IT professionals at various businesses. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe company said that 41% of the companies it surveyed have been avoiding the upgrade, and some “have gone so far as to actively resist the move by using software to prevent or disable Windows 10 installation.” The survey didn’t say why exactly companies were avoiding the upgrade, but the majority of respondents that did upgrade “rated the Windows 10 migration process to be somewhat to extremely challenging,” the survey said. \nAdditionally, the survey explained that although companies believe Windows 10 is high-quality software, internal business software compatibility “remain(s) as large barriers to Windows 10 deployment.” \nBut apparently, things will be brighter in 2017 when it comes to Windows 10 adoption, with Adaptiva saying that 64% of the survey respondents plan to move to to the new OS in the coming year. The survey didn’t specifically cite a major reason for the increase of Windows 10 adoption, but presumably it is because some businesses felt they could no longer avoid the upgrade. For more about Microsoft, watch: \nIf businesses decide to stick with older versions of Windows, Adaptiva predicts that Microsoft could encourage adoption by through measures like reducing support for the older Windows versions. That’s the stick, but the carrot of discounts related to Microsoft’s Azure cloud computing business service or Office 365 work productivity software could work just as well.",

      "title": "EU Clears $26 Billion Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal -- Update",
      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS--The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, post-merger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to its Office programs for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe EU's approval deals a blow to Salesforce Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn.

      "text": "By Natalia Drozdiak\nBRUSSELS -- The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, postmerger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to programming commands for its Office applications and cloud-computing services for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe concessions are mild. Microsoft already offers its Office Add-in program to professional social-networking services. Giving rivals access to its cloud-computing system could ultimately benefit Microsoft, because companies that took advantage of that system would use Microsoft products to do so. Moreover, LinkedIn has become the dominant professional social network without help from Microsoft's desktop, counting 467 million members in its most recent quarter, up 18% from a year earlier.\nThe EU's approval strikes a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nSalesforce in a statement encouraged regulators to be \"vigilant\" as they monitor Microsoft's use of LinkedIn.\n\"As AI [artificial intelligence], machine learning and other technologies continue to advance, questions around access to critical data sets will only become more important and Salesforce will continue to share its views with regulators and policy makers around the world about the ways in which access to data is emerging as a key issue in competition policy,\" said Salesforce's chief legal officer Burke Norton.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer-relationship-management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to permit rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft would allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nMoreover, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a collection of software used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the software, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 13:33 ET (18:33 ",

      "title": "EU Clears $26 Billion Microsoft-LinkedIn Deal",
      "text": "BRUSSELS—The European Union on Tuesday approved Microsoft's $26 billion acquisition of LinkedIn Corp., after the software giant agreed to safeguards to assuage antitrust concerns.\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, said it was clearing the deal on the condition that, post-merger, Microsoft allowed other professional networking sites access to its Office programs for the next five years. It must also grant computer manufacturers the option not to install the LinkedIn shortcut on desktop devices, the EU said.\n\"A growing number of Europeans subscribe to professional social networks. Today's decision ensures that Europeans will continue to enjoy a freedom of choice between professional social networks,\" said EU antitrust chief, Margrethe Vestager.\nMicrosoft announced its deal with LinkedIn in June.\nThe EU's approval deals a blow to Salesforce.com Inc., which lost out to Microsoft in the bidding for LinkedIn. It argued that Microsoft would gain an unfair advantage over competitors through its access to LinkedIn's vast pool of data.\nHowever, the EU said it was unlikely the deal would allow Microsoft to shut competitors such as Salesforce.com, Oracle and SAP out of the customer relationship management market. It ruled that access to the full LinkedIn database was inessential to compete in the market.\n\"We've now obtained all the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition and the deal will close in the coming days,\" Microsoft's Chief Legal Officer Brad Smith said in a blog post.\nTo win EU approval, Microsoft also agreed to allow rival social networks to access Office's application programming interfaces, which allow discrete programs to communicate with each another.\nAmong other things, the measures proposed by Microsoft will allow for the display of profiles from sites other than LinkedIn in a calendar entry of a meeting.\nIn addition, the EU said Microsoft must allow rival networks access to Microsoft Graph, a program used to build applications that can tap data in the Microsoft cloud. Developers already have access to the program, a person familiar with the matter said.\nWrite to Natalia Drozdiak at natalia.drozdiak@wsj.com\n 12:15 ET (17:15 ",

      "title": "Ransomware Tech Support Scam",
      "text": "Loading... \nThis scam combines two of our favorite criminal activities: ransomware and the Microsoft tech support scam. It was first reported by Avast security researcher Jakub Kroustek. This particularly nasty bug is known as Vindows Locker. If you’re infected with this bug and attempt to open a file, you’ll get a notice that the file can’t open. \nYou’ll also notice that .vindows file extension is now on the end of every one of your encrypted files. \nYou’ll then see a very poorly-worded pop-up with this poor guy’s face. (I’m fairly sure he isn’t actually involved at all.) The poorly worded message says that they have locked your files with the Zeus virus and that you must call level 5 Microsoft tech support at an 800 number. Then they will unlock you files for a one-time charge of $350. \nYou might be tempted to call the number in an attempt to rescue your files. But that’s not the number for Microsoft support, it’s the number for the hackers who infected your computer. They don’t want to fix it, they just want to scam you out of your credit card information and personal data, so they can use it to steal from you. Don’t be fooled by the fake Microsoft Support page that opens up after they gain access to your computer. It’s definitely a scam. \nBut unlike so many other encryption scams, there’s actually a fix for this one. Malwarebytes is offering a Vindows Decryption Tool. You can click here to download and launch. \nAs always, be very careful of what you click on. Always have up-to-date virus and malware protection installed on your PC. NEVER trust anyone who contacts you claiming to be from tech support. \n~ Cynthia \nTags: malware , microsoft , ransomware , security , tech support scams , windows   1:23 PM and is filed under Security Help   90507 Leave a Reply",

      "text": "Rohr not good enough for Eagles – Akpoborie Posted on Aug 8 2016 - 1:46am by Our Correspondent Federer, Williams out of India league \nFormer Super Eagles striker, Jonathan Akpoborie, says the move by the Nigeria Football Federation to hire Gernot Rohr as the new coach of the Super Eagles is far from being the best. \nRohf’s familiarity with African football having coached Gabon, Niger and Burkina Faso couple with a stint with Etouil Du Sahel of Tunisia makes him a firm favourite for the NFF led board of Amaju Pinnick. \n“I am not really against NFF decision to hire a foreign coach but I am sad that the football house are planning to appoint Gernot Rohr as Super Eagles manager,” Akpoborie revealed to Soccernet. com.ng “Going by his CV on some of the teams he has managed, I don’t think he deserves the senior national team job. \nHiring an average foreign coach for the team won’t change the declining level of football in the Super Eagles. “Coaching teams like Niger, Gabon and Burkina Faso may be great but not good enough for Nigeria. It would have been better to allow some of our indigenous coaches to manage the team than offer it to Rohr.” he said. About the Author",

      "title": "Microsoft’s Windows 10 Creators Update Will Go All-In on Security",
      "text": "Microsoft has unveiled Windows 10 Creators update features focused specifically on security advancements for enterprise customers and IT administrators. New features include a centralized security management portal that integrates with third-party security platforms, updates to Windows Defender Advanced Threat protection, and enhanced mobile application management for employee-owned devices.\nWhen Microsoft unveiled its Windows 10 Creators Update in October, the company was making an obvious play at professional designers, creative hobbyists, and businesses willing to experiment with virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR). The update hinted at a future in which consumers would be able to pull a photo of an armoire from an e-commerce website, convert it into a three-dimensional life-size image, and project a hologram of it into their bedrooms in order to determine if it’s the right fit and style before purchasing it. Companies would be able to offer virtual tours of showroom floors. You could browse the stores at a mall in Dubai and make purchases without ever leaving your couch in Des Moines. The revolutionary technology would enable businesses to make this possible, Microsoft claimed. But would businesses bite?\nShortly after the launch of Windows 10 in July of last year, Gartner Research predicted that 50 percent of businesses would begin Windows 10 adoption by January 2017. A February 2016 survey from system management company Adaptiva was even more bullish, with 63 percent of business respondents saying they expected to deploy Windows 10 by the end of 2016. Unfortunately for Microsoft, some early reports claimed actual (not intended) business adoption was as low as one percent, while other more optimistic surveys pegged the actual adoption rate at 38 percent . Microsoft, which does not reveal actual enterprise adoption stats, said in a statement that adoption had escalated 300 percent over the past six months.\nIn order to get buy-in from enterprises, Microsoft has gone to great efforts to try to secure Windows 10. Unfortunately, the operating system (OS) continues to suffer exploits that leave Windows 10 and its apps open to manipulation. Last month, the company patched 68 flaws, two of which had been exploited by hackers. Those patches join a long list of updates and fixes that the company has configured in order to make the system as airtight as possible.\n\nWindows Security Center Windows Security Center, which was released for Windows 10 in July, will be able to link back to the Office 365 Advanced Threat Protection suite in order to let IT admins track security events across the Windows ecosystem. Combined with new detection, third-party integrations, and the ability to isolate machines and quarantine files, these new features are designed to deliver faster, more comprehensive security procedures for organizations running across the Windows 10 ecosystem.\nMore specifically, IT admins will be able to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications that indicate potential kernel exploits. Teams can feed third-party intelligence into the Windows Security Center for alerts on activities for an additional layer of insight. Once attacks are confirmed, IT can isolate infected machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes, and quarantine or block files with a single click in the Windows Security Center, according to a Microsoft statement.\n\nBetter Device Management Microsoft will also begin to roll out new insights to the Windows Analytics dashboard that are designed to let IT managers handle device telemetry for device upgrades, updates, and health processes. The update will also automate Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) conversion for legacy BIOS on Windows 7. Rather than re-partition the disc and reconfigure the firmware in order to convert to UEFI, Microsoft has built a tool that will automatically handle the conversion.\nIT will now be able to protect data on personal devices without having to enroll the device in a mobile device management (MDM) program. IT will be able to apply policies to business-specific apps in order to secure corporate information, without having to manage an employee’s entire device.\nWhether or not these updates can lure reluctant businesses to Windows 10 remains to be seen. However, the updates address the concerns of businesses that have struggled with the unknown risks of migrating to a relatively new OS.\n",

      "text": "By Paul Hill Neowin LLC @_paulh93 · 6 seconds ago with 0 comments \nThe biggest tech consumer service hosts are banding together in order to better manage and tackle “terrorist content” on their services . Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter, and YouTube are coming together to create a shared industry database of hashes which will make it easier for the companies to find and remove such content. \nIn a blog post , Twitter said: \n“Starting today, we commit to the creation of a shared industry database of “hashes”– unique digital “fingerprints”– for violent terrorist imagery or terrorist recruitment videos or images that we have removed from our services. By sharing this information with each other, we may use the shared hashes to help identify potential terrorist content on our respective hosted consumer platforms.” \nAs the companies start to share the hashes of content that has been removed from their respective services, other participating companies will be able to find content on their own services correlating to the hash and decide independently whether or not the content should be removed. \nThe influence of social media sites such as Facebook and Twitter is growing rapidly, with some people using the sites as their primary source for information. As these sites get bigger they are being blamed for things such as playing host to terrorist content and allowing the distribution of alleged “fake news” , on both issues, tech companies have been pressured to take a more involved stance.",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 David Webb Nokia returns to the smartphone game in 2017 \nWith Microsoft seemingly focusing on the Surface Phone , Nokia announces plans to renter the smartphone market next year with a line of Android devices. \nNokia has joined forces with HMD Global, another Finnish company, which has licensed the Nokia brand in a 10-year deal. “Elegant simplicity. Trusted reliability. Lasting quality. We are unlocking new and extraordinary possibilities for billions of people,” is the statement that can now be found under the mobile section of Nokia’s website. “And we’re just getting started, with new smartphones coming in 2017.” \nNokia, which was bought by Microsoft in 2013, had attempted to enter the Android market month before it was sold with two handsets and a tablet. However when Microsoft purchased the Finnish cell phone company, it put the cabash on those plans in order to focus on the Lumia line. Now that Nokia was sold to Foxxconn earlier this year, it is now free to pick up where it left off. The question is, will it be able to compete with established giants like Samsung for any market share?",

      "text": "on Tuesday December 06, 2016 @10:30PM from the what-to-expect dept. An anonymous reader quotes a report from The Verge: Microsoft polled 17 women working in its research organization about the technology advances they expect to see in 2017 , as well as a decade later in 2027. The researchers' predictions touch on natural language processing, machine learning, agricultural software, and virtual reality, among other topics. For virtual reality, Mar Gonzalez Franco , a researcher in Microsoft's Redmond lab, believes body tracking will improve next year, and then over the next decade we'll have \"rich multi-sensorial experiences that will be capable of producing hallucinations which blend or alter perceives reality.\" Haptic devices will simulate touch to further enhance the sensory experience. Meanwhile, Susan Dumais , a scientist and deputy managing director at the Redmond lab, believes deep learning will help improve web search results next year. In 2027, however, the search box will disappear, she says. It'll be replaced by search that's more \"ubiquitous, embedded, and contextually sensitive.\" She says we're already seeing some of this in voice-controlled searches through mobile and smart home devices. We might eventually be able to look things up with either sound, images, or video. Plus, our searches will respond to \"current location, content, entities, and activities\" without us explicitly mentioning them, she says. Of course, it's worth noting that Microsoft has been losing the search box war to Google, so it isn't surprising that the company thinks search will die. With global warming as a looming threat, Asta Roseway , principal research designer, says by 2027 famers will use AI to maintain healthy crop yields, even with \"climate change, drought, and disaster.\" Low-energy farming solutions, like vertical farming and aquaponics, will also be essential to keeping the food supply high, she says.

      "text": "\nBefore one of Microsoft’s greatest consoles came to be in the form of the Xbox 360, the software giant dipped its toes in the gaming console pool with the original Xbox, the OG Xbox, the Darth Vader of Xbox (Darth Xbox). And other than the insanely large profile of the gaming system itself (it was the size of a standard VCR in that day, a pre-DVD… err Bluray player for all you millineals), the original Xbox controller was rather huge as well, requiring two hands to operate at all times. The controller was so huge in fact, that gamers took to calling it “Duke”.\nWell “Duke” may soon make it into the hands of current gen Xbox One owners, with the controller, or at least a current version of it, teased by original Xbox architect Seamus Blackley.\nAs promised, I am doing actual work to see if we can release a new Duke. Please stay tuned! RT if psyched! pic.twitter.com/BhkKEk7IUQ \n— Seamus Blackley (@SeamusBlackley) December 6, 2016 \n\nBlackley, who no longer works for Microsoft, mentioned that he may actually work current Xbox boss Phil Spencer to introduce an Xbox One compatible Duke controller. This is not the first time that Blackley has suggested the idea, initially mentioning it in October.\nThought Experiment: If we worked with @XboxP3 to release an official Xbox One compatible Duke, would you buy one? #bigisback @halo pic.twitter.com/j1LL7zd4cY \n— Seamus Blackley (@SeamusBlackley) October 6, 2016 \n\nThough it was inconvenient for most, some gamers actually liked the ergonomics of the “Duke”, as well as the six button placement. So far, no other information has been released on if/when this controller will come to market.\nWhat say our readers? Would you like the chance to use “Duke” on your new Xbox One? ",

      "title": "Tech companies move to target terrorist propaganda online",
      "text": "WASHINGTON Facebook, Microsoft, Twitter and YouTube are joining forces to more quickly identify the worst terrorist propaganda and prevent it from spreading online.\nThe new program announced Monday would create a database of unique digital \"fingerprints\" to help automatically identify videos or images the companies could remove.\nThe move by the technology companies, which is expected to begin in early 2017, aims to assuage government concerns — and derail proposed new federal legislation — over social media content that is seen as increasingly driving terrorist recruitment and radicalization, while also balancing free-speech issues.\nTechnical details were being worked out, but Microsoft pioneered similar technology to detect, report and remove child pornography through such a database in 2009. Unlike those images, which are plainly illegal under U.S. law, questions about whether an image or video promotes terrorism can be more subjective, depending on national laws and the rules of a particular company's service.\nSocial media has increasingly become a tool for recruiting and radicalization by the Islamic State group and others. Its use by terror groups and supporters has added to the threat from so-called lone-wolf attacks and decreased the time from \"flash to bang\" — or radicalization to violence — with little or no time for law enforcement to follow evidentiary trails before an attack.\nUnder the new partnership, the companies promised to share among themselves \"the most extreme and egregious terrorist images and videos we have removed from our services — content most likely to violate all our respective companies' content policies,\" according to a joint announcement Monday evening.\nWhen such content is shared internally, the other participating companies will be notified and can use the digital fingerprints to quickly identify the same content on their own services to judge whether it violates their rules. If so, companies can delete the material and possibly disable the account, as appropriate.\nMost social media services explicitly do not allow content that supports violent action or illegal activities. Twitter, for example, says users \"may not promote violence against or directly attack or threaten other people on the basis of race, ethnicity, national origin, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, religious affiliation, age, disability or disease.\"\n\"We really are going after the most obvious serious content that is shared online — that is, the kind of recruitment videos and beheading videos more likely to be against all our content policies,\" said Sally Aldous, a Facebook spokeswoman.\nThe White House praised the joint effort. \"The administration believes that the innovative private sector is uniquely positioned to help limit terrorist recruitment and radicalization online,\" said National Security Council spokesman Carl Woog. \"Today's announcement is yet another example of tech communities taking action to prevent terrorists from using these platforms in ways their creators never intended.\"\nThe new program caps a year of efforts to tamp down on social media's use by terrorist groups.\nLawmakers last year introduced legislation that would require social media companies to report any online terrorist activity they became aware of to law enforcement. The bill by Sens. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., and Richard Burr, R-N.C., was criticized for not defining \"terrorist activity,\" which could have drowned government agencies in reports. The bill was opposed by the Internet Association, which represents 37 internet companies, including Facebook, Snapchat, Google, LinkedIn, Reddit, Twitter, Yahoo and others.\nThe bill came days after Syed Farook and his wife, Tashfeen Malik, went on a shooting attack in San Bernardino, California, killing 14 people and injuring 21 others. A Facebook post on Malik's page around the time of the attack included a pledge of allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State group.\nFacebook found the post — which was under an alias — the day after the attack. The company removed the profile from public view and informed law enforcement. Such a proactive effort had previously been uncommon.\nTwitter moved toward partial automation in late 2015, using unspecified \"proprietary spam-fighting tools\" to find accounts that might be violating its terms of service and promoting terrorism. The material still required review by a team at Twitter before the accounts could be disabled.\n\"Since the middle of 2015, we have suspended more than 360,000 accounts for violating Twitter's policy on violent threats and the promotion of terrorism,\" said Sinead McSweeney, Twitter's vice president of public policy. \"A large proportion of these accounts have been removed by technical means, including our proprietary spam-fighting tools.\"\nFacebook has also used image-matching technology to compare images to ones it's already removed. The effort lets Facebook review images to avoid removing legitimate and protected uses, such as a photograph published by a news organization, a spokeswoman said.\nTerrence McNeil of Ohio was charged in 2015 with soliciting the killings of U.S. service members over social media, including Tumblr, Facebook and Twitter. Federal prosecutors accused him of posting a series of photographs on his Facebook account to praise the death of a Jordanian pilot who was burned to death by the Islamic State group — showing him before, during and after his death, including an image of him engulfed in flames, according to the complaint.\nIn January, the White House dispatched top officials, including FBI Director James Comey, Attorney General Loretta Lynch and National Security Agency Director Mike Rogers, to Silicon Valley to discuss the use of social media by violent extremist groups. Among the issues they discussed was how to use technology to help quickly identify terrorist content.\nThe four companies say they will be looking at involving additional companies in the future.\n___\nFollow Tami Abdollah on Twitter at https://twitter.com/latams",

      "text": "New app helps Resource Managers and Project Managers balance resource capacity and demand in a fast and intuitive way in Microsoft Project Online\n(PRWEB) December 06, 2016\nSensei Project Solutions announced today the official launch of the Sensei Resource Heatmaps App for Project Online, which provides support for Microsoft’s new ‘Resource Engagement Model.’\n“Resource managers can now quickly see bottlenecks across the organization and proactively manage allocations of resources to projects,” said Kenneth Steiness, CEO of Sensei Project Solutions. “Project managers also benefit, as they can see conflicts for resources assigned to their projects.”\nThree heatmaps help visualize the balance between resource capacity and demand in a much faster and more intuitive way.\nAvailability Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their capacity. This quickly shows how busy resources are with work from project schedules.\nEngagement Heatmap - Shows the engagement of resources in relation to their capacity. This allows resource managers to quickly determine the commitment level of resources.\nCoverage Heatmap - Shows the assignments of resources in relation to their engagements. This allows resource and project managers to ascertain mismatches in resourcing between the project schedules and engagements.\nWhen you view the Heatmaps, the coloring immediately draws your attention to problems. As users of Project Online would expect, a single click on the schedule icon will open the Project Desktop client to the relevant schedule, where the problem can be fixed immediately.\nThe Sensei Resource Heatmaps App is available for individual users in the Microsoft Office Store, and organizations can purchase an Enterprise license directly from Sensei Project Solutions.\nAbout Sensei Project Solutions:\nSensei Project Solutions, a Finalist for the 2015 Microsoft Project and Portfolio Management (PPM) Partner of the Year, focuses on bringing Instant Productivity to your team.

      "title": "Microsoft Announces Windows 10 Creators Update Will Modernize IT Tools And Advanced Threat Mitigation For Business Users",
      "text": "by Brandon Hill   Microsoft Announces Windows 10 Creators Update Will Modernize IT Tools And Advanced Threat Mitigation For Business Users Back in late October, Microsoft announced the Windows 10 Creators Update , which will arrive next spring for customers. At its keynote, Microsoft introduced a number of consumer-centric features including Paint 3D , improved inking support, and support for new virtual reality headsets. In the weeks since the original announcement, we’ve also learned about the Unified Update Platform (UUP) which reduces the download size of major Windows 10 updates by up to 35 percent.\nWhile the Creators Update might seem like all fun and games at first glance, there’s a lot more going on just beneath the surface that is being geared towards business customers. Microsoft says that it has already seen a 3x increase in the number of Windows 10 deployments by enterprise customers in the past six months, and the Creators Update brings new functionality to give IT professionals a “safer, more secure and more productive” environment to work in. \nWith the Creators Update, Microsoft has included new functionality for the Windows Defender Advanced Threat Protection (ATP). Windows Defender ATP was first introduced with the Anniversary Update, but now gains more useful tools to better identify and assess cyber threats. Cyberattacks are sniffed out using sensors that not only monitor network traffic, but that can also detect both kernel-level and memory exploits. \n“This will enable IT administrators to monitor loaded drivers and in-memory activities, and to detect various patterns of injection, reflective loading, and in-memory modifications indicating potential kernel exploits,” says Rob Lefferts, Microsoft’s Director of Program Management for Windows Enterprise and Security. \nMicrosoft already partners with FireEye iSIGHT Threat Intelligence to fortify the Windows Security Center, but the Creators Update gives IT administrators the ability to add their own intelligence parameters to suit their environmental needs. \nBut even if IT administrators take all the proper precautions to keep employees safe, there’s bound to that one guy (or gal) that will move mountains to wind up infected by some type of malware . In that case, Windows Defender ATP has built-in tools to help “isolate machines, collect forensics, kill and clean running processes and quarantine or block files with a single click” via the Windows Security Center. \nIf that wasn’t enough, Microsoft is making it easier to manage and support Windows 10 machines with the Windows Analytics dashboard and has incorporated an easy-to-use conversion tool to migrate legacy Windows 7 machines using BIOS to Unified Extensible Firmware Interface ( UEFI ). Finally, Microsoft has implemented Mobile Device Management software, which allows employees to use their own Windows 10 PCs to access work files, while at the same time keeping the data secure, “without [IT] taking on the added responsibility of managing employees’ personal devices.” \nMicrosoft is targeting a March 2017 launch for the Windows 10 Creators Update, and by the looks of things, both consumers and business will have much to be excited about.",

      "text": "EU Approves Proposed Acquisition Of LinkedIn By Microsoft December 06, 2016, 11:23:  The European Commission said it has approved proposed acquisition of LinkedIn by Microsoft Corp. ( MSFT ). The decision is conditional on compliance with a series of commitments aimed at preserving competition between professional social networks in Europe. \nAs a result, the company has now obtained all of the regulatory approvals needed to complete the acquisition, and the deal will close in the coming days, Microsoft said. \nThe approval in Brussels follows similar reviews and clearances in the United States, Canada, Brazil and South Africa. \nMicrosoft has committed that for the next five years it will continue to make Office Add-in program available to third-party professional social networking services. The Office Add-in program enables developers to integrate their services into Microsoft Outlook, Word, PowerPoint and Excel, providing users an enhanced experience using Office. It will continue to make promotional opportunities in the Office Store available to third-party professional social networking services. \nMicrosoft will ensure that IT administrators and users can customize their Office experience by choosing whether to display in the user interface the LinkedIn profile and activity information that may be integrated in the future. \nIf Microsoft develop a LinkedIn application or a tile for Windows PCs and include it in Windows, Microsoft will allow PC manufacturers to choose not to install them on their Windows PCs in the European Economic Area, or EEA. Similarly, Microsoft will ensure that users can uninstall the application and tile if they wish. Microsoft also won't use Windows itself to prompt users to install a LinkedIn application, although it can remain available in the Windows Store and be promoted in other ways. \nIn the EEA Microsoft won't enter into agreements with PC manufacturers for pre-installation of a Windows LinkedIn application or tile that would favor LinkedIn on an exclusive basis and thereby bar the distribution of competing professional social networking services. \nMicrosoft said in June that it agreed to buy LinkedIn Corp. for $196 per share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive of LinkedIn's net cash. \nFor comments and feedback: contact",

      "text": "Inside the Seattle Facebook office. Glassdoor is back with its annual rankings of “ Best Places to Work ” and Facebook took the top spot for tech companies.\nThe social media giant finished No. 2 overall, behind Bain & Company, for Glassdoor’s annual list, which pulls data from surveys that ask U.S.-based employees about career opportunities, compensation, senior management, work/life balance, culture, and more.\nThere were six tech companies among the top 10, including Google (No. 4), World Wide Technology (No. 5), Fast Enterprises (No. 6), LinkedIn (No. 8), and Adobe (No. 9). Airbnb, which took the No. 1 spot of all companies last year, fell to No. 35. Apple ranked No. 36; it’s one of three companies, including Google and Bain & Company, to make the top 50 each year since Glassdoor began releasing the annual list in 2009.\nDocuSign, which launched out of Seattle and has a large office in the city, ranked No. 23. Other Seattle-area companies include Concur (24th), Zillow (29th), Costco Wholesale (34th), Microsoft (37th), and Aegis Living (46th). This is Microsoft’s first time making the top 50 list.\nFor this particular list, companies are required to have at least 1,000 employees and 75 company reviews on Glassdoor, which uses an algorithm to calculate the rankings that assesses the quantity, quality and consistency of Glassdoor-approved company reviews shared by U.S.-based employees between November 2, 2015 and October 30, 2016. \nGlassdoor also released a list for the best small and medium-sized companies. Greenhouse Software, Illuminate Education, and Entelo took the top spots. Seattle-area companies on the list include RealSelf at No. 17 and Chef Software at No. 22.\nFounded in 2007 by Expedia and Zillow co-founder Rich Barton, along with his former Expedia colleague Robert Hohman, Glassdoor has a database of more than 600,000 companies with reviews and ratings across 190 countries. There are 34 million unique visitors to the site each month. The company raised a $40 million investment round in June , pushing total funding to date to $200 million and valuing the company around $1 billion.\nHere’s the full list of the top places to work for companies with at least 1,000 employees:\nCOMPLETE RESULTS – Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work 2017 – U.S. Large \nBain & Company  \nFacebook  \nBoston Consulting Group  \nGoogle  \nWorld Wide Technology  \nFast Enterprises  \nIn-N-Out Burger  \nLinkedIn  \nAdobe Power Home Remodeling  \nMcKinsey & Company  \nClorox Nestlé Purina PetCare  \nPaylocity  \nSAP  \nMathWorks Salesforce  \nForrester  \nThe Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints Intuit  \nDelta Air Lines  \nMemorial Sloan Kettering  \nDocuSign  \nConcur  \nAkamai  \nJohnson & Johnson  \nH E B  \nSouthwest Airlines  \nZillow NVIDIA Keller Williams Genentech  \nTrader Joe’s  \nCostco Wholesale Airbnb  \nApple  \nMicrosoft  \nlululemon FedEx Freight  \nSpace Exploration Technologies BASF Corporation  \nTexas Instruments  \nRaising Cane’s  \nMayo Clinic  \nIkea  \nAegis Living E. & J.
