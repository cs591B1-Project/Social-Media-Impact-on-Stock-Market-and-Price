      "text": "Cable television giant Comcast joins the open source ON.Lab ONOS and CORD initiatives focused on SDN, NFV and cloud development. The Open Networking Laboratory scored a significant new member as cable telecommunications giant Comcast has joined the organization’s Open Network Operating System Project.\nThe move sees Comcast join ON.Lab’s open source efforts on software-defined networking, network functions virtualization and cloud technologies. Those efforts include work on ONOS and the central office re-architected as a datacenter projects designed to develop platforms for creating and deploying new services at “cloud-like speed, independent of the access network architecture.”\n“Software-defined networking and network functions virtualization are powerful, fast-evolving tools for network transformation,” said Dr. Nagesh Nandiraju, director of network architecture at Comcast, in a statement. “We look forward to bringing our perspective and experience to the fantastic community of technologists already working on these open source projects.”\nComcast joins current ONOS and CORD service provider members AT&T, China Unicom, Google, NTT Communications, SK Telecom and Verizon Communication; and vendor partners Ciena, Cisco, Fujitsu, Intel, NEC, Nokia, Radisys and Samsung. Ericsson and Huawai are also members of the ONOS community.\n“Comcast, like the many network operators and service providers, is leveraging these emerging technologies as it evolves its network to meet next-generation demands,” ON.Lab noted in a statement. “A key component of the evolution is software distribution of the platform stack comprising ONOS, an SDN OS for service providers with scalability, high availability, high performance and the right abstractions to make it easy to create apps and services.”\nON.Lab in September released its ONOS Hummingbird SDN platform , which is the eighth from the organization. The platform is claimed to offer high availability and scalability, expanded southbound and northbound protocols, and improved ability to support incremental SDN on legacy devices. \nON.Lab last month announced a merger with fellow SDN organization Open Networking Foundation, with the combined entity to run under the ONF banner once the deal closes in late 2017. ON.Lab Founder and Executive Director Guru Parulkar is set to run the combined operations, with both entities maintaining “the integrity of both organizations and separate, but closely affiliated operations” focused on SDN and open source platforms until that time.\nParulkar earlier this year discussed ON.Lab and the ONOS Project as part of the RCR Wireless News NFV/SDN Reality Check video show. \n\nThe combined efforts of ON.Lab and ONF are set to include operations, membership, budget and employees. ONF counts 110 member companies, while ON.Lab states its ecosystem includes more than 70 companies and 17 partners.\nBored? Why not follow me on Twitter. \nThe post Comcast joins AT&T and Verizon in ON.Lab ONOS and CORD projects appeared first on RCR Wireless News .\n",

      "text": "Google Pixel XL from Verizon delayed once more to January By 0 \nTwo weeks ago we reported that Verizon’s shipment for the Google Pixel XL was delayed because of high demand . A new ship date was listed for those who pre-ordered for the Google phone and looks like it will be delayed some more. We don’t want to say we’re not surprised but really, this is the case now for some OEMs and carriers. Sometimes, we’re tempted not to believe any promises but as you know, you really can’t predict the market. \nVerizon did delay the release of Google Pixel XL from November 26 to January 13. We checked its page on Verizon and true enough, the new date information is there. \nNeither Verizon nor Google has released any numbers of how many units have been sold or ordered but we believe it’s already popular. As one of the first phones by Google, we noted that it’s Android redefined by the company. \nGoogle Pixel phones are said to be exclusive to Verizon but you can use the phone on other networks. If you get your order, you can trade it in with any T-Mobile phone. The latter will even give you half of the cost of the device. \nWe may have heard differing opinions and reviews about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL but we want to use the phone more extensively and for a longer time to really say if it’s worth every penny. \nChoose from any of the following colors: Very Silver, Really Blue, and Quite Black. Price tag still reads $869 but you can also get it with no downpayment for $36.24 per month for two years. Order the Pixel XL straight from Verizon .",

      "title": "Total Wireless question about Visual Voicemail on iPhones",
      "text": "Total Wireless question about Visual Voicemail on iPhones Phone: iPhone 6S (Verizon branded) Service: Total Wireless using a Tracfone SIM card I made the switch to Total Wireless a month and a half ago. I ended up purchasing the Tracfone SIM from Amazon for $1 and used that to activate. I knew there would be some trade-off's I'd have to make (No VoLTE or Tethering & Data Capped at 5mb down). What I didn't realize is that 1. Carrier name would be changed to TFW rather than Verizon 2. Visual Voicemail is no longer active. The VVM is a big annoyance but I have seen people post that they are able to use the Native VVM on iPhones with Total Wireless. Am I missing something? Does it have anything to do with the fact that I used a Tracfone SIM rather than a Total Wireless SIM? As I've been doing research, some people recommend using Google Voice for VVM but that is not an option as I use my GV # as well. I also don't want to rely on a 3rd party app for VVM. I would just prefer to use the Native VVM. So my question is, is there anyone out there that has Total Wireless and is able to use VVM? If so, which Sim did you use? Also I know Total Wireless and Tracfone are owned by America Movil, I set up another iPhone 5C and 5S on Tracfone last year and they both have VVM working without any issues. Any help is appreciated! Thanks in advance",

      "text": "Game 8: Georgetown Hoyas (3-4) vs Coppin State Eagles (0-8) Series: First Meting Where/When: Verizon Center, Wednesday 630PM EST TV: Fox Sports Networks (MASN2 in DC) Line: N/A KenPom: Hoyas 85-61, 99 percent Georgetown will be able to complete its MEAC Bingo card on Wednesday night when they face Coppin State for the first time. Up until now the Eagles had been the lone MEAC school to never face the Hoyas. This is the third of five 6:30 PM home starts this season and the first to allow fans into the Verizon Center for simply retweeting something from the University. Unless Coppin State travels exceptionally well this might be one of the lowest reported attendances of all-time at the Verizon Center for a Georgetown game. On the surface this game seems like it will be no contest but St. John’s loss to Delaware State on Tuesday should serve as a reminder – as if Georgetown needed one – that every team can be dangerous over forty minutes. After beating Howard on Sunday, Coach John Thompson III said that Isaac Copeland would probably miss the Coppin State game. If that holds true this will be the eighth straight game to start the season in which the Hoyas will be without a starter or expected rotational player (Hayes, Derrickson, Cameron, Copeland). Getting to know the Eagles Fang Mitchell no longer coaches Coppin State, a fact that was extremely disappointing to learn on Wikipedia. Coppin State dropped its last home game to Division II Chestnut Hill on Monday night. The most interesting thing I’ve found in looking up Coppin State info is that Chestnut Hill competes in a college sport that I didn’t know existed - Sprint Football. I fell down the Sprint Football rabbit hole Tuesday night rather than getting worried about which Coppin State guard could go for 30 on Wednesday night. Dejuan Clayton and Tre Thomas are the most likely guys to give the Hoyas fits. Hoyas Why to Watch: Is Derrickson back? Marcus hit his first two 3-pointers of the season against Howard in a season high 21 minutes. With Copeland likely to be out for the second straight game, Derrickson will get another chance to shake off the rust as he continues to come back from his own injuries. Will Reggie Cameron play? After not being with the team for a few games, Cameron was back on the sidelines against Howard. The next time the Hoyas lone fourth year senior checks in this season will be the first time. Cameron shot a career high 36 percent from 3-point range last season and could provide a spark off the bench should his number be called. Ron Thompson: After his interesting analysis during the Arkansas State game, Ron has proven that he will be worth the listen going forward during Georgetown games. Reason to be delusional: If Georgetown is ever going to get on a roll this season, it has to be now. For a team that still hasn’t won consecutive games this season, this is the second of three very winnable home games. Reason to be cynical: We’ve made it to game No. 8 there still isn’t a set rotation. Final Thoughts: Coppin State lost by 33 to Grand Canyon and Dan Majerle didn’t even play. Georgetown needs this game to be more like USC-Upstate than Howard as it’s the final layup on the schedule. Hoyas 80, Eagles 55 Image:",

      "text": "show chapters Altice USA CEO: All capital reinvested into fiber      5 Hours Ago | 05:11 Verizon 's Fios is about to get some major competition from the fourth largest cable operator in the U.S. \nA massive network of high-speed fiber optic internet is coming to 20 states over the next five years, according to a Wednesday announcement from Altice, the cable company behind Optimum, Lightpath and Suddenlink. \n\"We know that the data world is exploding — it will continue to,\" Dexter Goei, Altice USA Chairman and CEO, told CNBC's \" Squawk on the Street \" on Wednesday. \"We're seeing a doubling of the average speeds that we're delivering to our clients over the past year on Suddenlink.\" \nAltice's planned 10-gigabit per second connection far outpaces Google Fiber's current 1-gigabit per second connection, as well as Verizon Fios. Altice's \"future-proof\" plan comes as Google has scaled back its own expansion plans for the ultra-fast internet cables. \n\"To just go to one gig [per second], to us, seems like a waste of time,\" Goei said. \nCompanies like AT&T have looked toward internet-streaming based services to appease cord-cutters that have fled traditional cable bundles. AT&T's new DirectTV Now give subscribers access to at least 60 channels over the web , the kind of service that works better on faster internet connections. \nBut Goei said that Altice's new internet push doesn't mean it's seeing declining demand on its cable business. \n\"People are taking the bundle,\" Goei said. \"We welcome what our competitors are doing. We think however, we have a unique product, a unique pricing model and unique features in terms of really enhancing user productivity.\" \nDisclosure: CNBC's parent company, Comcast, is a cable and internet service provider.",

      "text": "Over the last month or two the Cleveland Plain Dealer has single-handedly been holding Verizon accountable for over-billing the company's wireless data customers. The paper has been documenting a significant number of instances where users suddenly faced significantly charges for data they claim they never consumed, including one woman that faced a bill for $9,100 for consuming 569 gigabytes of data (over just four days) she claims she never actually used.\nOver time, the paper has been able to document that Verizon saw a significant spike in users complaints in September for errant billing, as well as issues with Verizon's automated system that alerts customers that they're reaching their usage caps.\nIn an updated report , the paper points out that complaints to the FCC about errant billing dropped significantly for the month of October. But complaints are still significantly higher than any other carrier -- and are notably higher that Verizon's standard monthly complaint rate -- indicating that Verizon has at least partially fixed whatever was causing its systems to go haywire.\n\"While the numbers are down somewhat, the complaints filed last month remain quite high when compared to those filed earlier in the year,\" notes the paper. \"Consider that Verizon users drafted an average of 180 a month through the first eight months of the year. The 1,026 filings in October mark a 470 percent increase over that average.\"\nThe paper obtained the complaint numbers via the Freedom of Information Act, but Verizon has so far refused to clarify just what went wrong.\n\"It could be that Verizon made a fix without informing anyone,'' says Ed Mierzwinski, the consumer program director for the US Public Interest Research Group in Washington D.C. \"I've read your stories, and I've talked with Verizon. This problem was not consumers failing to understand their phones. There was something rotten at Verizon.''",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Ben Roffelsen Photography \nNovember 29, 2016 4:09 pm EST By Kate Cox @kcoxdc the singularity fcc mergers and acquisitions investors paradise ubs \nThis is shocking, we know, but: big businesses really like to make money. And when you’re already as huge as, say Comcast, one of the best ways to make oodles more money is to snap up another company and start raking in its revenues, too. Could Comcast snap up Verizon? Charter grab Sprint? At least one tech stock analyst thinks that deals like this, which might sound outlandish today, could be on the table soon. \nA UBS investor memo, noticed by DSL Reports , shows that for some Wall Street investors, the future looks bright. \nBased on the transition team President-Elect Donald Trump has named, it seems likely that incoming, as-yet-unnamed FCC leadership will be less focused on consumers and more focused on business than the current Commission has been. (Although the FCC has hardly been hostile to all mergers — AT&T/DirecTV and Charter/TWC/Bright House were approved since 2015, even though Comcast/TWC was blocked.) \nThe full memo [ PDF ] looks at prior mergers in the cable and telecom space, and then lays out a whole bunch of potential new mergers we could theoretically see proposed in the coming years: Comcast/Sprint, Comcast/T-Mobile, Charter/Sprint, Charter/T-Mobile, Sprint/T-Mobile, Dish/T-Mobile, Verizon/Sprint, Verizon/Dish, Verizon/Comcast, and Verizon/Charter \nThese aren’t deep-dives; each theoretical merger gets a brief one-page overview with a few positives, a few negatives, and a handful of industry implications. For example, the Comcast/T-Mobile page posits that the two would see a great deal of synergy from integrating wired and wireless products and infrastructure, while the Comcast/Sprint page points out that such a merger would result in high spending to upgrade Sprint’s network. \nSprint is the most-likely acquisition target, the memo posits — specifically citing the changing political climate as why. \n“With the confirmation of Jeffrey Eisenach to oversee the FCC transition, we believe consolidation could be back on the table with Sprint as a likely participant,” the company’s profile begins. And indeed, in a table reviewing all of the suggested mergers, purchasing Sprint is full of check marks in every column — all of which equal “more money”— for every other business. \nFCC makeup aside, though, the memo also points out that to a certain degree, continued consolidation might be all but inevitable. The delineation between “phone” and “TV” is no longer as strong as it once was, and with the internet everywhere and available on all devices, formerly-separate industries are slowly drifting together anyway. \nIn investor speak, that drift is “secular changes in technology and usage [leading] to the convergence of the cable and wireless industries.” \nThe memo continues, “The transformation of the internet into a mobile-first platform combined with the rapid migration of video from proprietary networks to digital and the rise in in competitive pressure this entails increases the value of an integrated fixed and wireless service to cable providers.” \nIn other words: even without a huge shift in the regulatory landscape making the business end seem like a good idea for investors right now, we’re getting there anyway. Video — through Netflix and Amazon, Sling TV and DirecTV Now — is increasingly decoupled from video providers, so everyone may as well go all-in on being an internet company… and internet means mobile.

      "text": "Two weeks ago we reported that Verizon’s shipment for the Google Pixel XL was delayed because of high demand . A new ship date was listed for those who pre-ordered for the Google phone and looks like it will be delayed some more. We don’t want to say we’re not surprised but really, this is the case now for some OEMs and carriers. Sometimes, we’re tempted not to believe any promises but as you know, you really can’t predict the market.\nVerizon did delay the release of Google Pixel XL from November 26 to January 13. We checked its page on Verizon and true enough, the new date information is there.\nNeither Verizon nor Google has released any numbers of how many units have been sold or ordered but we believe it’s already popular. As one of the first phones by Google, we noted that it’s Android redefined by the company.\nGoogle Pixel phones are said to be exclusive to Verizon but you can use the phone on other networks. If you get your order, you can trade it in with any T-Mobile phone. The latter will even give you half of the cost of the device.\nWe may have heard differing opinions and reviews about the Google Pixel and Pixel XL but we want to use the phone more extensively and for a longer time to really say if it’s worth every penny.\nChoose from any of the following colors: Very Silver, Really Blue, and Quite Black. Price tag still reads $869 but you can also get it with no downpayment for $36.24 per month for two years. Order the Pixel XL straight from Verizon .\nSOURCE: Verizon\nStory Timeline Google Pixel, Pixel XL displays can be turned on/off with magnets Verizon's shipment for Google Pixel XL delayed due to high demand Speed Test: Google Pixel XL VS.

      "text": "Create Home Network with Verizon Mi-Fi Hotspot calebfarnie Nov 30, 2016, 9:52 PM Hi, the only internet provider in our area is Verizon. We are looking to get one of their MiFi hotspots; however, we would also like to have a home network. This isn't really possible since the hotspot only allows about 5 connections (I think) and doesn't have any ethernet ports. I really don't want to use a repeater or bridge because it will bottleneck the connection through a Wi-Fi connection to the Mi-Fi device causing a limited speed.Is there a way to use a third party SIM-ready router, or will Verizon not allow this?Thanks,",

But it's actually the home screen of a kids' tablet.\nInstead of rows of app icons, Verizon 's new GizmoTab has kids navigating applications by putting them in different themed islands. Children can go to Doodle Town to get the Crayola Color, Draw & Sing app or Safari Island for Nat Geo Puzzle Explorer.\nVerizon unveiled the interface, along with 300 preloaded kid-friendly apps, on its latest children's tablet on Thursday. It's a part of the carrier's Gizmo lineup, which includes smartwatches for children that come with monitoring tools for parents. The telecommunications giant started working on the GizmoTab immediately after its Ellipsis Kids tablet, released last November.\nThe tablet for rugrats is available for $80 with a Verizon data plan, and $250 on its own.\nTech for kids continue to be a growing market, as parents search for inexpensive ways to give their children gadgets without having to worry about the devices being misused .\nAs the designated child among the CNET staff, I decided to dive into the digital ball pit and explore the tyke apps on the Android device.\nVerizon GizmoTab is a kids' tablet with a twist on the home screen The GizmoTab is what a tablet would be like if everything was turned into a game.\nby Alfred Ng 0:59 Close Drag The tablet boots up into the playful map interface, which functions more like a game than an operating system. You control it all through an avatar that has the feel of a Sims character. The map shows eight islands, each with a different theme for apps.\nIt's what a tablet experience would feel like if everything was turned into a game. Your child's character has to go to the school in a 3D town to get to educational apps and books, or warp over to the arcade to play minigames.\nParents can adjust settings so that kids have to learn to earn playtime, with GizmoTab tracking how much time is spent on educational apps versus games. You can also limit how much tablet time each kid gets.\n\"Parents are just constantly trying to manage screen time,\" said Kimberly Verbonitz, the chief revenue officer from app maker Fingerprint.\nVerizon partnered with Fingerprint to curate its kids apps, which were approved by education and parenting experts. With Verizon's first kids' tablet , parents were left in the dark about what apps were appropriate to download for their child, the company noted on its feedback.\nFingerprint selected its apps based on three criteria, Verbonitz said: its educational value, engaging gameplay and storytelling.\nThe children's experience is pretty limited, though. You can either play or learn -- that's it. There's no web browsing or YouTube , so your kids are stuck in the world Verizon created. It means not having to worry about your child racking up charges on your bill with in-app purchases, but it makes it harder to keep the kids entertained, even with hundreds of apps.\nTo break free, you'll have to go into parent mode, which is protected by a PIN. You can download apps from the Google Play store there and put them on the kid-friendly map through the feature.\nYou can also turn the GizmoTab into a fully functional tablet, with 3GB RAM running on Android Marshmallow. The feature comes in handy for the day your tyke outgrows the kiddy apps and wants to take off the tablet training wheels.\n ",

      "text": "Walmart, Target and Verizon Have Spent the Most on Holiday TV Ads So Far This Year Holiday ad spending is up 13.7 percent over 2015 By Jason Lynch December 1, 2016, 8:00 AM EST Television Walmart's \"Freak Out\" campaign was part of its $66.4 million in holiday TV ad spending. Walmart Holiday TV ad spending is off to a strong start this year, with brands shelling out $869.7 million on holiday-themed national ads so far in 2016. That's an increase of 13.7 percent over the same period last year. Holiday ad spending has jumped $105.2 million in 2016, going from $764.5 million last year to $869.7 million, according to data from TV ad tracking company iSpot.tv. The company tracked holiday-related TV advertising from when those ads first began airing on Sept. 4 through to Nov. 28, Cyber Monday. While spending was up double-digits, the number of brands utilizing national advertising for holiday ads dropped slightly from 255 brands in 2015 to 247 this year. The number of holiday spots aired jumped 6.7 percent, from 230,152 to 245,499. Walmart led the pack again with an estimated $66.4 million in holiday ad spending, though that number was down slightly from $67.6 million last year. Target, which almost doubled its holiday ad spending from last year, came in second with $49.7 million. Another brand significantly increasing its holiday spending this year was Google, which jumped 336 percent, from $1.7 million in 2015 to $5.7 million this year. That went to its new Google Home smart home device, not its Pixel phone, whose ads were handled by Verizon. Coca-Cola increased its holiday ad spending by more than 250 percent, jumping from $3 million last year to $7.6 million in 2016. At the other end of the spectrum, Best Buy's national holiday ad spend fell 36 percent, from $28 million to $18 million. The holiday ad with the largest 2016 spend so far has been Apple's \"Frankie's Holiday\" ad, the brand's 2016 holiday commercial starring Brad Garrett as Frankenstein. While the two-minute spot is just a week and a half old, Apple has run it in 20 high-profile spots, for an estimated total spend of $12.7 million. Verizon's pre-Black Friday ad came in second with an estimated spend of $11.8 million over 766 airings. These were the top brand spenders on holiday TV ads this year from Sept. 4 to Nov. 28: Walmart, $66.4 million",

      "text": "  08:00 AM EST Verizon unveils the GizmoTab -- the ultimate learning experience for kids \nNEW YORK , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Verizon is making kids' education more fun and exciting with the December 1 launch of GizmoTab , an exclusive, next-gen kid's tablet designed to jumpstart your child's learning experience right out of the box. Even better, activate your GizmoTab on the nation's most reliable 4G LTE network and receive unlimited access to 300 premium learning apps handpicked by educational experts, featuring recognizable brands and characters that children love, including: Crayola, DreamWorks Animation, Hasbro, The Jim Henson Company, Highlights for Children, HiT Entertainment, National Geographic, Sesame Workshop, Toca Boca and more — at no additional charge.

Parents told us that they wanted trusted and relevant content that would engage their children and the ability to add their own content. The GizmoTab meets both of those needs. We've created a great tablet kids and parents will love.\" \nFun for kids; parent approved The GizmoTab learning experience is built around a comprehensive content service designed specifically for kids ages 3–8. What's more, all of the apps are based on key subject areas, including English language arts, math, science, critical thinking and creativity. \nWith the GizmoTab, you can measure and display aspects of your child's progress, tailor the fun to your child's age and skill level, set time limits and reward your child with additional play time. You can download your favorite children's apps from the Google Play store and add them to your child's experience with GizmoTab. The content catalog will be updated monthly so that there's always something new for your kids to play and learn. \nBuilt kid tough for the whole family Under the hood, GizmoTab is a full-featured tablet with a powerful processor, expandable memory and adult-size version of Android OS, so your child can get more use out of it even after outgrowing the software. In fact, with its 8\" HD display, the whole family can stream movies, surf the web, game and more. \nGizmoTab comes with a removable bumper to protect against even the toughest drops, bumps and scratches. And with 5,100mAh battery and Verizon 4G LTE connectivity, you can rest assured that your child will be entertained on those long road trips. \nAdditional specs: Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 617 Octa Core processor Android Marshmallow OS RAM: 3GB; Flash:16GB memory; upgradeable to 128GB with microSD card (sold separately) 8MP rear camera; 5MP front camera 1080p video recording \nPricing and availability GizmoTab is available from Verizon online and in stores Dec.1. You can purchase yours for $79.99 with new two-year activation. A standard data plan is required to access the free 300 premium learning apps.

      "text": "Blog This \nSCOTTSDALE, Arizona , Dec. 1, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- ABI Research ranks Verizon as the leader among 12 strategic commercial telematics suppliers considered in its latest competitive analysis. Trimble and TomTom Telematics receive second and third place, respectively. Verizon's dramatic acquisition strategy results in a wealth of ecosystem partners, a broad product portfolio, and extensive vertical segments to place it in a strong position with the potential for massive scale during the continuing consolidation of the commercial telematics industry. \nLogo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20151014/276887LOGO \nThe top five companies, overall, listed by rank include Verizon, Trimble, TomTom Telematics, Omnitracs, and Geotab. Verizon, Trimble, Teletrac-Navman, Omnitracs, and Geotab are the top five commercial telematics vendors for best implementation due to their organizational health, ecosystem partnerships, and product portfolios. Meanwhile, Trimble, Verizon, TomTom Telematics, Geotab and Omnitracs are the top five most innovative thanks to their work in vehicle monitoring, feature sets, and cloud/convergence. \n\"Verizon, with the acquisitions of Fleetmatics and Telogis, will be the largest global commercial telematics vendor by an order of two times,\" says Susan Beardslee , Senior Analyst at ABI Research. \"Telogis brings a wealth of enterprise capabilities, OEM relationships, and long-haul fleets; while, Fleetmatics brings a significant subscriber base in local field service, with a strong presence in Western Europe .\" \n\"The industry will see continued transformation through strategic acquisitions, partnerships, and consolidation as suppliers shift toward more open platforms, connected solutions, and prognostics,\" concludes Beardslee. \"Examples of this include Geotab's open API platform and certified channel partners, Omnitracs' recent Intelligent Vehicle Gateway (IVG), and Trimble's PeopleNet for built-in remote diagnostics.\" \nThese findings are from ABI Research's Commercial Telematics: Competitive Assessment of Strategic Innovation and Implementation ( https://www.abiresearch.com/market-research/product/1025967-commercial-telematics/ ) report. \nAbout ABI Research \nABI Research stands at the forefront of technology market research, providing business leaders with comprehensive research and consulting services to help them implement informed, transformative technology decisions.

With the holidays fast approaching, it's time to update you on iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability and wait times at Apple online and at retail stores. \nAlmost immediately after Apple opened up presales of the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus at 12:01 a.m. PDT on Sept. 9, virtually all models were spoken for by Apple's loyal iPhone base, even though analysts predicted for months that the new iPhones would receive a lukewarm response due to its lack of new design and unexciting features. \nIn late September, we reported that sources claimed iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability would improve by Oct. 8. While inventory of the 4.7-inch iPhone 7 in most colors, carriers and configurations showed signs of greater availability, the same could not be said about the more in demand 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus . \nBy the time Halloween came around, we once again checked out iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus availability . All colors, storage sizes and carrier configurations for the iPhone 7 significantly improved, with most in stock online and in Apple retail stores. The iPhone 7 Plus on the other hand, remained as elusive as it has since it first began shipping on Sept. 16. iPhone 7 Availability From Apple Online And Retail Stores \niPhone 7 Jet Black (128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849), Black, Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $32.41/mo or $649, 128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849): \nShips in one day and is available in Apple retail stores. \niPhone 7 Jet Black (128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849), Black, Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $32.41/mo or $649, 128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849): \nShips in one day and is available in some Apple retail stores. \niPhone 7 Jet Black (128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849), Black, Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $32.41/mo or $649, 128 GB $36.58/mo or $749, 256 GB $40.75/mo or $849): \nShips in one day and can be purchased in Apple retail stores. \niPhone 7 Jet Black (128 GB $749, 256 GB $849), Black, Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $649, 128 GB $749, 256 GB $849): \nShips in one day and is available in many Apple retail stores. iPhone 7 Plus Availability From Apple Online And Retail Stores \nAT&T \niPhone 7 Plus Jet Black (128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969), Black (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969): \nNot readily available in stores, delivers by Dec. 22. \niPhone 7 Plus Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969): \nAvailable in some Apple stores, delivers by Dec.22. \nVerizon \niPhone 7 Plus Jet Black (128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969), Black (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969), Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969): \nAvailable in some Apple stores, with deliveries by Dec.22. \nSprint \niPhone 7 Plus Jet Black (128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969), Black (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969): \nAvailable in some stores, delivers by Dec 22. \niPhone 7 Plus Rose Gold , Gold and Silver (32 GB $37.41/mo or $769, 128 GB $41.58/mo or $869, 256 GB $45.75/mo or $969): \nAvailable in some Apple stores, delivers by Dec.22. \nT-Mobile \niPhone 7 Plus Jet Black, Black (128 GB $869, 256 GB $969): \nAvailable in some stores, delivers by Dec 22. \niPhone 7 Plus Rose Gold, Gold and Silver (32 GB $769, 128 GB $869, 256 GB, $969): \nAvailable in some Apple stores, delivers by Dec.22. \nHave you been able to score your iPhone 7 or iPhone 7 Plus of choice yet?

      "text": "Reddit CBS today announced a new deal with the NFL to bring its coverage of the league to its All Access streaming service available across a variety of devices including iPad, Apple TV, and the web. Starting this weekend on December 4th, CBS All Access users will be able to view all of the network’s regular, preseason and postseason games going forward. But Verizon continues to have an exclusive on streaming NFL on CBS games to mobile phones, which means the new deal won’t open up the content to iPhone and other smartphone users. “We are very pleased that our partnership with the NFL has been expanded to include CBS All Access,” said Leslie Moonves, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of the CBS Corporation. “Adding the most watched programming on television, to the most watched network on television, will be a powerful combination as we continue to grow CBS All Access into the future.” The company’s press release notes that All Access subscribers will be able to stream “all NFL ON CBS games, including Thursday Night Football on CBS, as well as pregame and halftime coverage live.” The content will be available in 150 markets and subscribers will be able to see any games that are being broadcast in their local markets. In addition to the CBS app for iPad and Android/Windows 10 tablets, All Access subscribers will also be able to tune in through CBS apps on Apple TV, Xbox One and Xbox 360, Roku Players, Chromecast, Android TV, Amazon Fire TV and Fire TV Stick, and PS4, and online at CBS.com . Verizon customers previously had access to NFL on CBS games through an exclusive partnership with the NFL app, and CBS notes in its press release that games will continue to be exclusively available to those users for iPhone and other mobile phones. As part of the new deal, All Access users will also find some content from the NFL Game Pass subscription video service as a bit of cross promotion between the two, and beginning next season some NFL ON CBS coverage will show up on NFL properties.",

      "text": "Verizon Wireless \nNormally we see Verizon post a service alert on its website well before any of its customers recieve a new software update on their devices. Today the company seems to be breaking that long habit, but the effected users aren't complaining. According to posts on the dedicated sub-Reddit and XDA forum , the Verizon version of LG's modular G5 is being updated to Android 7.0 starting today. Huzzah, tally ho, three cheers, et cetera. \nThough a few users report that the installation started and subsequently failed, others say they had no issues grabbling the 1.67GB(!) file and installing it. The changelog mentions new themes for LG's software skin, a longer grace period for deleted photos, and the LG Downloads app has been swapped out for the Google version. Users on both sides of the country report that the update is live, but it still might take a while to get such a sizeable file out to all those phones. \nVerizon is behind the international GSM model , T-Mobile , and Sprint when it comes to updating this particular phone, with only AT&T lagging among the big four carriers. Again, we can't independently confirm that the Android 7.0 update is going out to the Verizon LG G5, but it seems like the rollout is beginning, at least for some. Try a manual update check if you're impatient... just make sure you're on Wi-Fi first. Source:",

      "text": "  11:00 AM PST by Steven Cohen \nThe educational tablet is now available through Verizon. \nVerizon and Fingerprint have announced the launch of the new GizmoTab next-gen kid's tablet. The device features Fingerprint's family-friendly digital platform with hundreds of fun, educational apps curated and merchandised by age, subject, media type, and popular themes. \n\"With the addition of the GizmoTab, Verizon has created a portfolio of family products that parents can trust and their children will enjoy for years to come,\" said Jeffrey Dietel , vice president, wireless devices, Verizon. \"Since the launch of the Verizon Gizmo product line, we spent a lot of time listening to what our customers wanted in a kid's tablet. Parents told us that they wanted trusted and relevant content that would engage their children and the ability to add their own content. The GizmoTab meets both of those needs. We've created a great tablet kids and parents will love.\" \nThe tablet features an 8\" IPS TFT LCD display with a resolution of 1920x1200 and 282 PPI. Under the hood, the device is powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 Octa Core processor running Android Marshmallow OS along with 3GB of RAM and a 5,100mAh battery. An 8MP rear camera and a 5MP front camera are integrated as well. \nDesigned with children in mind, the GizmoTab's app library helps parents ensure quality screen time along with the ability to measure and tailor a child's progress and set appropriate time limits. In addition, customers who activate the tablet on Verizon's 4G LTE network will receive free unlimited access to 300 premium curated learning apps featuring brands like Crayola, DreamWorks Animation, Hasbro, The Jim Henson Company, Highlights for Children, HiT Entertainment, National Geographic, Sesame Workshop, Toca Boca, and more. \nVerizon's GizmoTab is now available for $250 without a plan or $80 with a new two-year contract.",

      "text": "Verizon named ‘Best Wireless Service’ by Global Traveler readers in latest survey Media contacts @andrewtesta \nNEW YORK – Verizon was voted as the winner of the Best Wireless Service award in Global Traveler’s 13th annual GT Tested Reader Survey. Each year, Global Traveler asks frequent business and luxury travelers to name the best of the best in a variety of traveler-related categories, and Verizon took top wireless honors for the ninth time. \n“Whether you’re on the road for business or pleasure, you want the security to know you’ve got the best wireless communications possible,” said Rob Miller, vice president of marketing for Verizon. “The road warriors who are the readers of Global Traveler know from real-life experience: Verizon provides clear value.” \nWith extensive international service across the world, including access to 4G data speeds in 88 countries, Verizon keeps its customers connected with a variety of affordable and flexible plans for all international travelers. \nTravelPass allows customers to use their mobile device abroad just as they do at home. For just $2/day per line, customers can use their domestic talk, text and data allowances in Mexico and Canada and $10/day per line in more than 100 other countries worldwide. The new Verizon domestic plans with 12GB data or more offer free calling to, as well as while roaming in, Mexico and Canada. Verizon also offers attractive monthly international plans as well as pay-as-you-go pricing. \nThis year, more than 20,000 Global Traveler readers responded in the GT Tested Reader Survey awards. GT readers are frequent premium travelers averaging nine international and 13 domestic round-trip flights a year. Global Traveler’s readers spend an average 50 nights per year in hotels. \nFor more information on the GT Tested Reader Survey, check out the December 2016 issue of Global Traveler or visit its website at globaltravelerusa.com .",

      "title": "Verizon Updates Their Kid-Friendly Gizmo Line With the GizmoTab",
      "text": "Verizon Updates Their Kid-Friendly Gizmo Line With the GizmoTab By Chance Kinney · On December 1, 2016 \nAround this time last year, LG and Verizon released the Ellipsis Kids Tablet, GizmoPal 2 and the GizmoGadget , a couple of kid-friendly wearables and a tablet exclusive to Verizon and their network. Verizon seems to be making a habit of holiday Gizmo releases — today, they’re announcing the GizmoTab, an 8″ kids tablet that can be adjusted as children get older. \nLike most tablets, the GizmoTab is basic on the inside — it’s powered by an octa-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 617 SoC, 3 GB of RAM, and a 5,100 mAh battery. The tablet only has 16 GB of storage, but that can be expanded by 128 GB with a microSD card. There’s also a 5 MP front camera and an 8 MP rear camera that can take 1080p video. It’s not a powerhouse, but it’s above average for a kids tablet, especially for the kinds of games and apps that will come with the GizmoTab. \nUsually, kids tablets either run Android with parental controls or a closed-off system that only allows content that the manufacturer approves. The GizmoTab is of the former type, running Android 6.0 Marshmallow. Parental controls include the abilities to set time limits and schedule no-use times (like during dinner). These limits can be made flexible, as parents can use an app to give kids bonus time for helping out around the house, for example. Parents can also set browsing filters that can be adjusted as kids get older, or can use the tablet themselves in adult mode. \nBut none of that is unique to the GizmoTab, so the real draw comes from the free content. Verizon went all-out here — 300 premium educational games and apps have all been made free with purchase of the GizmoTab. At that number, they won’t all be preloaded, but kids and parents can easily browse that selection and download what they want. Verizon says they’ll continue to update this catalog over time. The apps in question are ones that would normally cost money — Verizon says they’re making $600 worth of apps free to anyone who buys the GizmoTab. First Impressions We’ve spent some time playing and testing the new GizmoTab, and it’s clear that Verizon has spent a lot of time listening to feedback from users of their Ellipsis 4G tablet for kids. To that effect, not only have they improved the software running on their new GizmoTab tablet, but also the hardware. With a better display, better battery life, and more performance under the hood, this time around the hardware is powerful enough that mom and dad will want to use the GizmoTab too – and they easily do so by switching to the regular Android interface. Furthermore, the new parental control software running on the tablet is not only more intuitive, but the 300 free handpicked apps for kids make the GizmoTab an incredibly competitive value. All in all, the GizmoTab sets a new bar for kids tablets. \nStarting today, the GizmoTab is available at Verizon stores for $80, but it has to be paired with two-year activation on their network and a data connection — the data plan is necessary to gain access to the 300 free apps. At the outset, purchasing the GizmoTab will also net you a gift card for Toys ‘R’ Us, Barnes & Noble, or The Gap. That gift card is worth $100 if you add a GizmoPal 2 or GizmoGadget smartwatch. Verizon will also have a selection of padded bumper cases and tablet stands in various colors.",

      "text": "by Karl Bode Thursday Dec 01 2016 16:14 EST \nEarlier this week Suddenlink and Cablevision owner Altice surprised many by announcing plans to skip DOCSIS 3.1 cable upgrades, and instead deploy a territory-wide 10 Gbps-capable fiber to the home network. It was surprising in large part because the company has a bit of a reputation for skimping on necessary upgrades overseas, and Suddenlink employees had been complaining the company was creating a \"culture of fear\" with layoffs and nitpicked expenditures. With the company now promising fiber to the home across its entire footprint, one of the biggest impacts will be on Verizon -- a company that has frozen most of its fixed-line upgrades to focus on wireless and getting into the ad industry (its acquisitions of AOL and Yahoo).\nSpeaking to the Wall Street Journal , Verizon tried to downplay the impact Altice's plans will have on the company's bottom line. \n“A fiber-to-the-home network? What a novel idea. I guess that’s why we started building ours back in 2003 and it’s now available to nearly 14 million homes and businesses,” a Verizon spokesman said. \nAgain, though, Verizon has made it clear that the lion's share of its attention is fixed on either content or advertising, or 5G wireless. But Altice USA CEO Dexter Goei tells the Journal he doesn't believe that even 5G wireless will be able to match the speed and reliability of fiber optic broadband. \n“We know that there will be applications and demand for further bandwidth going forward, whether that is in two, three, four or five years,” Mr. Goei said. The Altice announcement will hopefully be good news for Verizon, Suddenlink and Cablevision customers alike, as it may force Verizon to compete more seriously on price -- while prodding Verizon to bump its top available FiOS speeds from 500 Mbps to 1 Gbps.",

      "text": "Verizon’s Nougat Update For The LG G5 Starts Rolling Out December 1, 2016 - Written By Justin Diaz \nIt looks like Verizon has started to send out the software updates for Android 7.0 Nougat to the LG G5 on their network as of today. If this is the start of the roll out process, then it could still take a couple of weeks before all LG G5 users on Verizon Wireless are fully updated, but that being said, if you own this device on the US’ largest wireless carrier, it might be worth going in and checking manually to see if the Nougat software is available for you to download, if the update alert hasn’t already popped up in your status bar. \nWhenever the update becomes available to you, it’s definitely recommended that you connect to Wi-Fi for the install as the download for the system update is one hefty file, weighing in at almost 1.7GB in size. This won’t mean much for taking up space on the phone really, but it is a rather large file to download completely over the cellular network, especially if you don’t have a large amount of 4G LTE data at your disposal. In addition to connecting up to Wi-Fi, it’s also not a bad idea to make sure you have a mostly full battery before starting the download. \nWith the installation of Android 7.0 Nougat, LG G5 owners have a good amount of new features and changes to expect, not the least of which is the support for multi-window as well as the new and improved Doze Mode that will help extend the battery life somewhat. Of course, as you can tell from the image below the Nougat update also includes things like a collective of new themes to apply to your phone. If you’re the type that likes to personalize their device, then this is likely to be one of your favorite features. You’ll also find that LG is enabling the ability to restore any images that you have deleted by accident which is sure to come in handy if you often batch delete your pictures. Naturally, and although it’s not required, it’s not a bad idea to do a backup of the device just in case something goes wrong, but since this is an official update being sent out from Verizon any chances of a hiccup are much less likely. Still, it never hurts to be prepared anyway. While this update is just hitting the LG G5 on Verizon, it’s following the Nougat update that went out to those on T-Mobile just a couple of days ago on November 29th. Post navigation",

      "text": "Verizon Unveils the Kid-Friendly ‘Gizmotab’ for $249 December 1, 2016 - Written By Alexander Maxham \nWireless carriers have moved away from pushing smartphones as much as they have in the past. The reason for this is that most people already have a smartphone, and they aren’t looking to upgrade for 2-3 years. So wireless carriers have had to look elsewhere for revenue, which many have resorted to selling tablets with 4G LTE connectivity. Verizon Wireless already has a good number of tablets available, like the ASUS ZenPad Z8, ZenPad Z10 , Samsung Galaxy Tab E 9.6 and more. Now they are adding the Verizon Gizmotab to their lineup. \nThe Verizon Gizmotab is a tablet that is aimed specifically at kids. It competes with the Amazon Fire Tablet Kids Edition that sells fairly well for the retail giant. The Gizmotab features Android 6.0 Marshmallow, but it’s loaded up with a slew of kid-friendly apps. So kids won’t really even know that it’s running Android (kids this young likely won’t even know what “Android” is anyways). This is an 8-inch tablet that sports up to 300 premium learning apps. All of the apps and games on this tablet are educational, including a few educational 3D games, including one where kids can check out an arcade and a school for more learning activities. \nFor parents, you’ll be able to customize a slew of items on this tablet. For instance, you can set time limits for your child or children to use the tablet. You can also reward them with additional playtime, for each hour of learning time on the Gizmotab. There is also a Parent Dashboard which allows you to keep track of your child’s usage and also measure their progress. Parents have the ability to pick and choose which of the 300 premium apps available that their child will get to use. \nDon’t want to buy a tablet just for your kids? Not a problem. The Gizmotab is actually a fully-functioning Android tablet. So you are able to use the tablet for things like web browsing, checking out Twitter, Facebook and much more. Verizon launched the Gizmotab today, and it’s priced at $249 outright, there’s also the option to pick it up for $79 on a new two-year contract, or $10.41/month on Verizon EDGE. Remember that you’ll be adding this to your account as it is an LTE device, and that’ll cost you $10/month for the access fee and it’ll dip into your pool of data.",

Verizon has just started rolling out the OTA update to owners of its version of the LG G5 .\nSee also: LG G5 review April 8, 2016 This latest update rollout comes after the same phone was upgraded to Nougat on Sprint , T-Mobile and US Cellular . The Verizon update started earlier in the day on Thursday, and the carrier has finally published its official Nougat update changelog . Reports and screenshots from Reddit and XDA members show that this download is about 1.67GB in size, which means you’ll likely need to be on a Wi-Fi connection to grab this file.\n\nIn addition to the new Nougat update, and all the features that it contains, this Verizon download for the LG G5 also adds some new themes to customize the look of the phone’s screen. The changelog also shows that the update will allow people to restore files put into the trash folder for as long as seven days. Finally, LG’s own Downloads app is replaced with this update by the Google Downloads app.\nAs always, some owners may not see this update for the phone for a few days as it completes its rollout on the network. If you own the LG G5 from Verizon, let us know if you are getting this Nougat update in the comments.",

The update seems to have just started, as both readers pinged us with the news at almost the exact same time. <span id=\"more-194260\"></span>\nVerizon has not yet published their typical updated support page with details, though. Still, from the screenshot below, you can see that the update is a solid 1.6GB. You’ll definitely want to be on WiFi for this one and have plenty of battery.\nAs we get more info on it, we’ll update this post. For now, jump into settings and check for it!\n<a href=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cym35e7W8AAqE1Q.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone wp-image-194262\" src=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cym35e7W8AAqE1Q.jpg\" alt=\"lg g5 nougat verizon\" width=\"542\" height=\"963\" srcset=\"http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cym35e7W8AAqE1Q.jpg 1152w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cym35e7W8AAqE1Q-246x438.jpg 246w, http://www.droid-life.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Cym35e7W8AAqE1Q-551x980.jpg 551w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 542px) 100vw, 542px\" /></a>\n<strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">UPDATE</span></strong>: And the update is now official as build VS98726B.

You should probably go read through the full list to get familiar with all that is about to change.

      "text": "Android 7.0 Is Rolling Out For Verizon’s LG G5 By Tyler Lee on 12/01/2016 16:00 PST \nSo a couple of days ago, T-Mobile started to push out the Android 7.0 Nougat update for the LG G5 . For those of you guys who bought the LG G5 from other carriers, such as Verizon, the good news is that you didn’t have to wait too long because according to reports , it seems that the Android 7.0 update is finding its way to Verizon LG G5 handsets as well. \nIn a post on their website , Verizon has detailed some of the changes that users can look forward to with the Android 7.0 update finding its way onto the phone. This includes all kinds of new features such as themes, multi-window functionality, improved notification pulldown shades, cleaning settings menu, and more. \nThis will also no doubt give the LG G5 a new lease on life, not that it really needed it but considering it was launched earlier this year and with so many newer phones in the market today, the Nougat update should indeed be a much-welcomed one. If you don’t see the update available for you yet, not to worry as we’re sure it will find its way to you. \nAlso if you did get notified about the update, you’ll want to ensure that you’re connected to a power source and also WiFi so that you won’t blow through your data allowance, and also to make sure that there is enough battery to complete the update.",

      "text": "Venus Montalbo \nAt long last, the Android 7.0 Nougat update is now hitting the Verizon variant of LG G5. Also, Sony’s Xperia XZ is starting the receive Google’s latest Android iteration. \nLG G5 units located in South Korea got the Android Nougat flavor first. Afterward, LG G5 owners in the U.S. were able to taste the Android 7.0 Nougat through firmware updates released by major network carriers Sprint, US Cellular and T-Mobile. And now, a fresh report from Droid Life revealed that Verizon is also releasing the Android 7.0 Nougat update for its LG G5 model. LG G5 on Verizon Appears to be Seeing Nougat Update Today – #android #lgg5 https://t.co/hjdNJ0R956 pic.twitter.com/tkGfKb88Po \n— Droid Life (@droid_life) December 1, 2016 \nThe 1.6GB firmware update with build number VS98726B brings an assortment of new features of the Android Nougat to the LG G5. The change-log also specified that upon installation, G5 owners will be able to choose from the new themes to help them further personalize their device. Google Downloads app is also replacing LG’s own app. Through this update, LG G5 users will also be able to “restore deleted images from the trash folder for 7 days.” \nFurthermore, one of the highlights of the Android Nougat OS is the multi-window support which lets the users split the screen and utilize two apps simultaneously. Verizon Wireless’ official support page, explains how to use the Multi-Window feature of the Android 7.0 Nougat . \n“Start Multi window display, press and hold Recent Apps (square button). To use specific apps in each of the 2 windows, just tap on the Home button and select the app, or select the app in the split screen Overview section.” \nLG G5 users simply need to tap on the Multi-window button if they want to end the multi-window display and revert to a full-screen display. [Image by David Ramos/Getty Images] \nCharging another device via the LG G5 is now possible, too, thanks to the latest Android firmware update. Users should also find an improved access to Quick Settings and a Settings Menu that is easier to read and use. Moreover, changing the app icons’ size and the screen fonts are has become easier as well because of the newest update. “Unlocking the device with notifications displayed has been modified where the unlock screen will not show overlaying notification displays,” the support page also noted. \nAside from the LG G5, the Android 7.0 Nougat OS has also been seen hitting Sony’s Xperia XZ . A report from GSM Arena cited a tip from one of their readers in India noting that the firmware is now rolling out. And based on a post from XDA Forum, the first wave of release for the Android 7.0 Nougat update on Sony Xperia XZ is scheduled for countries like Russia, The Netherlands, Turkey and Australia. Make sure to have enough memory space available as the firmware is 1GB hefty. \nThe Android Nougat OS is also starting to roll out to Xperia X Performance, according to Sony. It’s here: Android 7.0 Nougat now rolling out for #Xperia XZ & Xperia X Performance https://t.co/mqiwkWU5lC pic.twitter.com/DVFbTIAtw4 \n— Sony Xperia News (@SonyMobileNews) December 1, 2016 \nFor other Sony users, here are the mobile devices getting the official Android 7.0 Nougat OS as well, as confirmed by the Japanese tech company: Xperia X, XA, XA Ultra, Xperia Z3+, Z4 Tablet, Z5, Z5 Compact and Z5 Premium. \nThe respective software updates for Verizon LG G5 and Sony Xperia XZ should be available via the Over-The-Air or OTA process. Having a strong Wi-Fi connection is advised to ensure a smooth download and installation process of the Nougat update. The battery should also be fully charged for the update process to push through. But since OTA rollouts are usually done in phases, it may take longer for other LG G5 and Sony Xperia XZ units to receive the firmware. But once the Android Nougat update arrives, an on-screen prompt should pop up to notify and guide you through the OTA process. \n(Featured Image by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)",

      "text": "Verizon Rolls Out Android 7.0 Nougat Update for the LG G5 GO Third U.S. carrier to release the Nougat update for the G5 Dec 2, 2016 05:55 GMT · By Andrei Vlad · Share: Verizon customers who bought the LG G5 were probably anxious to get Android 7.0 Nougat on their phones seeing that Sprint and T-Mobile have already rolled it out to their customers. The good news is it didn't take Verizon too long to release the Nougat update for the LG G5. The Big Red has just announced it has kicked off the rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat for LG G5, so it should reach all devices in the coming days. Before downloading the update you should know a couple of things. First of all, the update is going to come via Wi-Fi or Verizon's network, so make sure you have a strong connection regardless of the method you decide to use. It's also important to ensure that the phone's battery is fully charged before starting the Android 7.0 Nougat software update. Apart from that, you should know that the upgrading process might take up to 20 minutes since this is a fairly sizable download at 1.7GB. Lots of changes for Verizon LG G5 Now, here are some of the new features you'll get after upgrading to Android 7.0 Nougat. A new range of Themes will be added, which will allow you to personalize your phone. Also, you will now be able to retrieve deleted images from the Gallery since they will be stored in the Trash folder for 7 days. In order to retrieve a photo, you can head to Gallery / Albums / Trash and tap the 3 dots Menu icon to move the photo to whatever folder you want. Furthermore, you will now be able to use the LG G5 to charge another device. The screen display when a USB cable is connected to the LG G5 has been slightly modified to make room for new options. Naturally, the multi-window support is there as well, which will allow you to split the screen and use 2 apps at the same time. Also, unlocking the device with notifications displayed has been modified and the unlock screen will not show overlaying notification displays. Sound and Notifications settings have been separated and Storage and USB has been replaced by Storage. It's also worth noting that the LG Downloads app has been replaced by the Google Downloads app. CHECK OUT THE GALLERY (12 Images)",

You can also buy a Daydream View for 1/2 off if you buy a Pixel/Pixel XL at the same time. \n\nThe cheapest brand new phone that I could find that appraises at $1 TIV is the AT&T GoPhone Samsung Galaxy Express 3 (J120A). It is on sale at CVS for $40 through Saturday. \n\nIf you get the CVS coupon emails, I got a $6 off $30 coupon so that brought it down to $34 + tax. The % off coupons won't work on this since it is on sale. And I tried to use Extra Bucks but the system wouldn't allow it. YMMV.\n",

      "title": "FCC 600 MHz auction sets $40.3B target for Verizon, AT&T and T-Mobile",
      "text": "Verizon, AT&T, T-Mobile and other telecom operators have a new target with stage three of the FCC’s 600 MHz incentive auction set for its forward round. Telecommunication operators are set for their third chance to acquire access to 600 MHz spectrum licenses, though they will need to come up with more than $40 billion in combined bids to close the Federal Communications Commission’s latest incentive auction round.\nThe government agency wrapped up the third stage of the 600 MHz incentive auction reverse auction process, with television broadcasters setting a $40.3 billion target price for 108 megahertz of total spectrum that the FCC plans to repackage into 80 megahertz of licensed spectrum on offer to interested parties. The third stage forward auction process is expected to begin Dec. 5.\nStage three is set to include a total of 3,303 blocks of spectrum, each of which with 10 megahertz of capacity. The licenses are to be broken into partial economic area-sized chunks, with each PEA having up to eight blocks of spectrum up for grabs.\nPrevious attempts at unleashing what is considered highly desirable low-band spectrum have fallen short as combined bids from telecom operators have fallen significantly short of what television broadcasters have demanded.\nStage one of the process witnessed broadcasters requesting more than $86 billion for 126 megahertz of total spectrum, with telecom operators halting their bidding for 100 megahertz of clean spectrum at a mere $23 billion. Stage two had broadcasters asking for $56.5 billion for 114 megahertz of total spectrum, which failed to generate more than one round of forward auction bidding from telecom operators.\nOne positive for stage three is the total amount required to complete the auction has now come in below the record-setting amount seen in the most recent AWS-3 auction proceedings , which raised $44.9 billion in gross proceeds for 50 megahertz of licensed and 15 megahertz of unlicensed spectrum spread across the 1.7/2.1 GHz bands. There has been some concern that they large amount of money earmarked for those licenses could limit the amount of cash spent on the 600 MHz bands. \nAnalysts have noted the 70-megahertz clearing target is the more likely round in which supply and demand meet, noting the band plan associated with that stage most aligns with repackaging challenges and telecom operator interest.\nThe 70-megahertz mark also is the magic number for T-Mobile US and other carriers with a dearth of sub-1 GHz spectrum holdings. Pre-auction rules include a set-aside provision that calls for 30 megahertz of at least 70 megahertz of spectrum to be auctioned off outside the reach of companies with a dominate position in sub-1 GHZ spectrum holdings, which among larger operators is limited to Verizon Communications and AT&T.\nAnalysts have noted that as the complicated incentive auction process moved along it might appear the two sides could be getting closer to a match, though it must be taken into account that the amount of clean auction being offered to telecom operators is shrinking with every stage, thus total bid amounts per stage is also likely to drop.\nSome have expressed concerns over the auction process actually finding a match between the two sides.\n“The relatively modest 26% reduction in the clearing cost of the reverse auction is a strong indication that broadcasters are unlikely to give up their spectrum at anything but premium values,” noted Dan Hays, principal at PwC’s Strategy& division. “At $40.3 billion we believe that the cost is still far beyond the appetite of mobile network operators. This makes a fourth stage of the auction a virtual certainty. Even more disturbing is the notion that the large gap between the forward and reverse auctions could persist and perhaps be an early indicator a potential eventual failure to successfully complete the auction altogether.”\nFCC Chairman Tom Wheeler has repeatedly cited the 600 MHz spectrum as key for 5G work, with the timing on having that spectrum available for commercial wireless services falling in line with plans for broader 5G deployments around 2020. \nHowever, some have noted the government agency may have stymied its incentive auction plans with the announcement this past summer of its Spectrum Frontiers program , which looks to open up nearly 11 gigahertz of spectrum above the 24 GHz band in support of mobile telecom services. The spectrum is set to include 3.85 gigahertz for licensed use in the 28 GHz, 37 GHz and 39 GHz bands, and 7 gigahertz for unlicensed use across the 64 GHz to 71 GHz bands.\nThose high-band spectrum assets include much wider swaths of licenses seen as important to the high-bandwidth needs of 5G services. A number of carriers and their vendor partners have already prestandard 5G technology trials using spectrum in those bands in an effort to gain insight into how they might operate in real-world deployments.\nThe FCC is also moving on a new spectrum-sharing model for the 3.5 GHz spectrum band that could provide access to what is considered mid-band licenses in support of 5G services. \nThe 3.5 GHz band is now in the hands of the Department of Defense for use in certain radar installations, as well as by non-federal fixed satellite service earth stations for receive-only, space-to-earth operations and feeder links. The somewhat limited propagation characteristics of the 3.5 GHz band are thought to be a good fit for the dense deployment plans for small cells and would likely limit interference with current users.\nSprint, which decided to sit out the incentive auction process, this week slighted the spectrum up for bid as “the spectrum of the past.” The carrier noted its ample 2.5 GHZ spectrum holdings as one of the reason it did not partake in the 600 MHz spectrum auction\n“The world is moving towards high capacity wireless data networks, and in that world the best and most efficient spectrum that is needed to cater for that … is mid-band spectrum,” noted Sprint CFO Tarek Robiatti.\nBored?

      "text": "Verizon’s GizmoTab tablet could be an excellent Christmas gift for your kid Does your child like tablets? By Alexandra Arici \nChristmas is approaching quickly and if you haven’t purchased a gift for your kid yet, Verizon might have what you need. The carrier has just released a new child friendly tablet dubbed the GizmoTab, designed for children aged 3 to 8. \nThe GizmoTab features an 8-inch HD display (720p resolution) and a Snapdragon 617 processor breathing life into the device from under the hood. The slate has 3GB of RAM and 16GB of internal memory (expandable via microSD cardslot up to 128GB). \nChildren can use the slate to take photos as well thanks to the 8MP main camera and a 5MP selfie snapper. A big plus of the GizmoTab is the hefty 5,100 mAh battery which will keep the tablet going for a long time. \nThe tablet comes encased in a (removable) bumper protects against accidental drops and bumps. \nAs you can see the tablet is quite decent spec-wise. What we’re not told is whether the device allows parents to limit accessibility to certain apps or overall usage of the tablet. \nWe do know that GizmoTab arrives with a series of 300 premium learning apps including approved by educational experts. Kids will be able to find titles like Crayola, DreamWorks Animation, Hasbro, National Geographic, Toca Boca, Sesame Workship, HiT Entertainment or The Jim Henson Company onboard. \nThe GizmoTab runs Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow out of the box and won’t probably see any Nougat during its life time. \nThe GizmoTab is available from Verizon online and in brick and mortar locations starting December 1 and can be yours for $249.99 outright or for $79.99 with the usual two year activation affair. \nFor a limited time, Verizon also offers an additional offer. Parents who purchase the GizmoTab will also receive a gift card for one of the following: Toys R Us, Barnes & Noble or the Gap.",

      "title": "FCC Raises Fresh Concerns Over 'Zero-Rating' by AT&T, Verizon",
      "text": "By Thomas Gryta\nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc.\nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers.\nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc.\n21st Century Fox and News Corp, parent company of The Wall Street Journal, share common ownership.\nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers.\n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday.\nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board.\nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator.\nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \"reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\"\nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app.\n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday.\nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T.\nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program.\nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T $16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day.\n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states.\nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service.\n--Ryan Knutson contributed to this article.\nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com\nCorrections & Amplifications\nThis item was corrected at 11:35 a.m. ET to show that Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc., not solely Disney and 21st Century Fox.\n 11:32 ET (16:32 ",

      "text": "FCC Raises Fresh Concerns Over 'Zero-Rating' by AT&T, Verizon December 02, 2016, 11:45:00 AM   FCC Raises New Concerns Over 'Zero-Rating' by AT&T, Verizon \nFederal regulators raised new concerns about AT&T Inc.'s practice of excluding its new DirecTV Now streaming service from data charges and, for the first time, lobbed similar questions at Verizon Communications Inc. \nIn a pair of letters sent Thursday, the Federal Communications Commission warned that so called zero-rating, which makes the data used by certain video services free for the carriers' wireless customers, could harm competition and consumers. \nThe agency argues the practice could deter consumers from accessing mobile-video services not affiliated with the carriers, such as those from Netflix Inc. or Hulu, which is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc. \nBoth AT&T and Verizon responded Friday that the practice complies with existing rules and benefits consumers. \n\"We will provide the FCC with additional information on why the government should not take away a service that saves consumers money,\" AT&T said Friday. \nThe FCC's letters come on the heels of the launch of DirecTV Now this week and after Republican congressional leaders last month asked the agency to stop taking controversial regulatory actions until the new presidential administration is on board. \nThe FCC first raised its concerns with AT&T last month, the day after the presidential election. AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator. \nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \" reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\" \nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app. \n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday. \nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T. \nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program. \nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T$16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day. \n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states. \nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service. \nRyan Knutson contributed to this article. \nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com \nCorrections & Amplifications: Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Disney and 21st Century Fox were sole co-owners.

AT&T responded with a detailed defense that hasn't satisfied the regulator. \nJon Wilkins, the head of the FCC's wireless division, in Thursday's letter wrote that the agency has \" reached the preliminary conclusion that these practices inhibit competition, harm consumers, and interfere with the 'virtuous cycle' needed to assure the continuing benefits of the open internet.\" \nThe FCC's letter to Verizon notes that the carrier's actions have \"the potential to hinder competition and harm consumers.\" Verizon excludes data charges to its wireless customers for its National Football League games or its go90 mobile-video app. \n\"We remain quite confident that our practices are good for consumers, non-discriminatory and are consistent with current rules,\" Verizon said Friday. \nThe agency requested both companies respond by Dec. 15, including a list of detailed questions for AT&T. \nAT&T says other video providers can also pay to cover data costs for their customers at the same rates as its DirecTV subsidiary. Verizon offers a similar program. \nThe FCC estimates that an outside video provider would have to pay AT&T$16 a month for each customer who used 10 minutes of streaming video a day, rising to $47 a month for a customer using 30 minutes a day. \n\"That would make it very difficult, if not infeasible, to offer a competitively priced service,\" the letter states. \nThe Dallas telecom firm, which agreed to buy Time Warner Inc. for $85.4 billion in October, began zero-rating its DirecTV video app in September as well as its new DirecTV Now over-the-top service. \nRyan Knutson contributed to this article. \nWrite to Thomas Gryta at thomas.gryta@wsj.com \nCorrections & Amplifications: Hulu is co-owned by Walt Disney Co., Comcast Corp., 21st Century Fox and Time Warner Inc. An earlier version of this article incorrectly stated that Disney and 21st Century Fox were sole co-owners.
