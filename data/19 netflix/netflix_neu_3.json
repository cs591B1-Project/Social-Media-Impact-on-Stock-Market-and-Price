      "text": "Netflix's new 'Black Mirror' episodes draw parallels to 'Twilight Zone' By The Associated Press | Sunday, Nov. 20, 2016, 2:33   36 minutes ago William Shatner's bumpy flight. Burgess Meredith's smashed eyeglasses. The fateful misinterpretation of the phrase “to serve man.” Even after a half-century, these memes can still deliver a jolt of recognition. The anthology series “Black Mirror” takes you through a high-tech looking glass with jittery tales sure to lodge in your brain for years to come, as it reclaims the hallowed realm of “The Twilight Zone” for a new millennium. Netflix has just released six new episodes that supplement seven previous hours created for British television. Among the new crop, “Hated in the Nation” unveils what is literally a killer app that lets people choose the day's most disliked individual— who will then be put to death. “Men Against Fire” chillingly confronts prejudice on the battle front. “Nosedive” takes social-media “likes” to the nth degree of crazed approval-seeking. “Shut Up and Dance” exposes a teenage boy who, after his computer is hacked, will do anything to keep his private life private. “Black Mirror” is set in the present, or in an all-too-plausible near-future, with tales that are, by turns, descriptive or cautionary or devilishly speculative. Some episodes are grim, some perversely playful. Most are shot through with a streak of mordant humor. How to further explain the essence of “Black Mirror”? Ask Charlie Brooker, its creator, co-producer and the writer of most of its episodes. Brooker, 45, is an English media critic, satirist, TV personality and screenwriter whose piercing contributions to Brit cultural life may have been a bit too U.K.-centric to have made the leap to American shores. Until now. Perhaps it's no surprise that Brooker's starting point for “Black Mirror” was his childhood obsession with America's “The Twilight Zone,” with its socially progressive parables, twist-y endings and shivers delivered down the viewer's spine. Decades later, as Brooker set about framing his new series, he asked himself, “What's the big thing worrying people now?” To him, the answer seemed obvious: the disruptive effects of ever-mounting technology. Episodes of the show he comes up with typically unfold in an oblique, contemplative fashion, reflecting a modern age when technology, notwithstanding each breakthrough, is largely taken for granted. That said, Brooker would like to straighten out a common misconception: “There are people who say this is ‘the anti-technology show.' That really makes me cross!” He doesn't look cross. He is rumpled, affable and animated as he corrects the record: “You COULDN'T do this show if you weren't interested in technology. “Usually, the technology isn't to blame in the stories,” he adds. “It's just facilitating some weakness in our character. It saddens me when people think this show is written by an angry old man who's furious at pixels.” In Brooker's mind, “Black Mirror” treats technology as if it were a drug whose side effects— some benign, some dire — are being analyzed. “Hopefully the show isn't wagging a finger at you. It's really down to the viewer what they take away.” Another half-dozen episodes are in the works for release in a year or so, and beyond that, “as long as we have ideas, and people want to watch, we'll carry on,” he promises. He acknowledges it's hard to stay ahead of the curve. “But because we're sort of dreaming out loud onto the page, we can start with a ‘what-if' idea and identify the human story at the heart of it. Then we work out some technological means of allowing it to happen. But luckily, I don't have to work out how the wiring works. “Usually,” he confides, “the broad idea is something that makes me laugh on some level. And then I'll be describing it to Annabel (Jones), my co-showrunner, and she'll go, ‘Oh, my God, that's horrible!' And then, to appall her even more, I will embellish it. And at the point when I'm REALLY laughing, and she's near tears, we know we're in the ‘Black Mirror' section of the Venn diagram.” Finally, “Black Mirror” defined! Now you can't say you weren't warned. More More A & E",

      "text": "It's been over a year since Netflix first announced the revival of Gilmore Girls and finally, we are just a few days away from a long-awaited return to Stars Hollow.\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, which hits Netflix on Nov. 25, will be comprised of four 90-minute episodes and follow the show's titular characters, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop).\nBut, what's Gilmore Girls without Sookie? Or coffee at Luke's? In addition to the the three Gilmore girls, dozens of beloved members of the cast, including Luke (Scott Peterson), Paris (Liza Weil), Kirk (Sean Gunn), and, of course, all of Rory's ex-boyfriends: Dean (Jared Padalecki), Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and Logan (Matt Czuchry), will make appearances.\nIn fact, there will be over 30 returnees. But here are eight members of the former cast that, unfortunately, will not be apart of your Netflix-binge watch on Black Friday.\n1. Richard Gilmore, Edward Herrmann Richard and Dean Source: Giphy Herrmann, who played Lorelai's father and Rory's grandfather on the show from 2000 to 2007, died of brain cancer in 2014 at the age of 71. However, he will still have a part in the show . In the trailer his widow Emily reveals a larger-than-life portrait of Richard to the surprise of Rory and Lorelai.\n2. Max Medina, Scott Cohen Max Source: Giphy Max Medina, Rory's high school teacher and Lorelai's love interest in seasons one and two, was not written into the revival's script.\n\"One person I didn't figure out how to get in was Scott Cohen, whom we love so much,\" Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator, noted to Entertainment Weekly in April.\n3. Marty, Wayne Wilcox Marty Source: Giphy According to TVLine , Marty, also known as Naked Guy or Rory's fellow-Marx Brothers-loving friend from Yale, will not be be making an appearance in the reboot series.\n4. Honor Huntzberger, Devon Sorvari Honor, Rory and Honor's bridal party Source: Netflix Although both Logan and his father, newspaper mogul Mitchum Huntzberger, will be returning for the reboot , it seems that Logan's sister Honor, and her mother Shira, will not be. \"Honor's too busy ruling the world... (But she'd totally cave to peer pressure - online petition!)\" Sorvari tweeted when asked if she'd be in the revival in March.\n5. and 6. Madeline and Louise, Shelly Cole and Teal Redmann Madeline and Louise Source: Giphy According to GilmoreNews , both Madeline and Louise will not be joining their fellow Chilton alums Rory and Paris for a spring break reunion.\n7. Liz Danes, Kathleen Wilhoite Liz and Jess Source: Giphy When actress Melissa McCarthy initially tweeted in February she had not been invited to participate in the revival, Wilhoite, who played the role of Luke's sister and Jess' mother, responded , \"Well, then I'm in good company. U rule, Melissa. I wasn't asked back either, tho, I think for entirely diffrnt reasons.\"\n8. Dave Ryjaski, Adam Brody Dave Source: Giphy Despite being a fan-favorite, Adam Brody's character Dave will likely not be appearing in any of the episodes. The rest of the members of Hep Alien , Lane Kim (Keiko Agena), Brian Fuller (John Cabrera), Zack Van Gerbig (Todd Lowe) and Gil (Sebastian Bach), however, will be reunited on the small screen.",

      "text": "TWEET It's been over a year since Netflix first announced the revival of Gilmore Girls and finally, we are just a few days away from a long-awaited return to Stars Hollow. Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, which hits Netflix on Nov. 25, will be comprised of four 90-minute episodes and follow the show's titular characters, Lorelai (Lauren Graham), Rory (Alexis Bledel) and Emily (Kelly Bishop). But, what's Gilmore Girls without Sookie? Or coffee at Luke's? In addition to the the three Gilmore girls, dozens of beloved members of the cast, including Luke (Scott Peterson), Paris (Liza Weil), Kirk (Sean Gunn), and, of course, all of Rory's ex-boyfriends: Dean (Jared Padalecki), Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) and Logan (Matt Czuchry), will make appearances. In fact, there will be over 30 returnees. But here are eight members of the former cast that, unfortunately, will not be apart of your Netflix-binge watch on Black Friday. 1. Richard Gilmore, Edward Herrmann Richard and Dean Source: Giphy Herrmann, who played Lorelai's father and Rory's grandfather on the show from 2000 to 2007, died of brain cancer in 2014 at the age of 71. However, he will still have a part in the show . In the trailer his widow Emily reveals a larger-than-life portrait of Richard to the surprise of Rory and Lorelai. 2. Max Medina, Scott Cohen Max Source: Giphy Max Medina, Rory's high school teacher and Lorelai's love interest in seasons one and two, was not written into the revival's script. \"One person I didn't figure out how to get in was Scott Cohen, whom we love so much,\" Amy Sherman-Palladino, the show's creator, noted to Entertainment Weekly in April. 3. Marty, Wayne Wilcox Source: Giphy According to TVLine , Marty, also known as Naked Guy or Rory's fellow-Marx Brothers-loving friend from Yale, will not be be making an appearance in the reboot series. 4. Honor Huntzberger, Devon Sorvari Honor, Rory and Honor's bridal party Source: Netflix Although both Logan and his father, newspaper mogul Mitchum Huntzberger, will be returning for the reboot , it seems that Logan's sister Honor, and her mother Shira, will not be. \"Honor's too busy ruling the world... (But she'd totally cave to peer pressure - online petition!)\" Sorvari tweeted when asked if she'd be in the revival in March. 5. and 6. Madeline and Louise, Shelly Cole and Teal Redmann Madeline and Louise Source: Giphy According to GilmoreNews , both Madeline and Louise will not be joining their fellow Chilton alums Rory and Paris for a spring break reunion. 7. Liz Danes, Kathleen Wilhoite Liz and Jess Source: Giphy When actress Melissa McCarthy initially tweeted in February she had not been invited to participate in the revival, Wilhoite, who played the role of Luke's sister and Jess' mother, responded , \"Well, then I'm in good company. U rule, Melissa. I wasn't asked back either, tho, I think for entirely diffrnt reasons.\" 8. Dave Ryjaski, Adam Brody Dave Source: Giphy Despite being a fan-favorite, Adam Brody's character Dave will likely not be appearing in any of the episodes. The rest of the members of Hep Alien , Lane Kim (Keiko Agena), Brian Fuller (John Cabrera), Zack Van Gerbig (Todd Lowe) and Gil (Sebastian Bach), however, will be reunited on the small screen.

      "text": "\"You a whole different type of brotha - you do realize that, right?\" Netflix has unveiled the full trailer for the indie film Barry , telling another story about the early years of President Barack Obama. Barry is about \"Barry\" Obama during his college years, with an afro and everything, as played by Devon Terrell . Most of it takes place around New York City, as Obama was studying at Columbia University at the time. The cast includes Anya Taylor-Joy , Ashley Judd , Jenna Elfman , Ellar Coltrane , Jason Mitchell and John Benjamin Hickey . With the first teaser trailer , I mentioned that I didn't need to see anything else to be sold. This new trailer shows quite a bit, but I'm still into it - I really want to see this right away. Take a look.\nContinue Reading ",

      "title": "13 Movies On Netflix To Watch When You Need A Girl Power Boost",
      "text": "By Michelle Lulic an hour ago \nWhen women come together, amazing things can happen. However, finding movies about strong women on Netflix isn't always an easy feat — even if you're scrolling through the category labeled \"Movies Featuring A Strong Female Lead.\" While Netflix's selection of girl power movies certainly exists, the options for movies about independent and loving characters remain rare and few, which can make picking a movie for your girls' night in one heck of a hassle. Luckily for you, help is on the way. Instead of you spending hours scrolling through each category, I compiled a list of the girl power movies that I'm sure you've been craving. \nNetflix has a number of different films at your disposal to help prove that there's nothing a woman can't do, and that there's nothing women can't acheive when they come together. Girl power movies feature women defying the odds, breaking the mold, and not being afraid to fearlessly love one another. And, yes, these emotional, inspirational stories certainly are out there. These tales include women of all ages and backgrounds coming together for a greater cause. So get your best girlfriends together to join you for your next Netflix movie watching experience. These films will have you feeling the girl power in no time. 1. Bring It On (2000) [Embed] \nIn Bring It On , a group of cheerleaders come together to win the championship trophy, and the best team prevails in the end. Watching the rises and falls of these cheerleading masters will make you feel like you can do anything, even and especially when you play by the rules. 2. Mean Girls (2004) [Embed] \nA movie about teenage mean girls might not immediately scream the words \"girl power\" to you. However, Mean Girls encourages us to build a society where girls work with one another instead of constantly fighting, which is a perfect message to push you to embrace your feminist potential. 3. A Royal Night Out (2015) [Embed] \nEven royalty deserves a girls' night out every once in a while. A Royal Night Out follows the adventures of Princess Elizabeth and Princess Margaret as they explore the London town and get away from their royal duties. Running a country shouldn't take away from a girl's ability to have fun. 4. Mothers and Daughters (2016) [Embed] \nMother-daughter bonds may be unbreakable, but that doesn't mean that they are immune to hardships. When a photographer decides to look at the relationships between multiple mothers and daughters, the audience gets a sneak peak into the complexities of each one. 5. Tracks (2013) [Embed] \nNothing can hold a woman back from her need for adventure. Tracks follows Robyn's (MIa Wasikowska) 1,700-mile journey across Australia, alone and refusing to let anyone stand in her way. 6. Peace, Love & Misunderstanding (2011) [Embed] \nYour family can help you feel the girl power, too. Three generations are reunited in Peace, Love & Misunderstanding 's tale about respecting the people around you and viewing life from another's perspective. 7. Short Term 12 (2013) [Embed] \nOne woman (Brie Larson) makes a world of a difference for a community when she refuses to ignore the needs of others. Short Term 12 speaks to the notion of standing up for yourself while simultaneously working to have everyone else's back, too. 8. The Girl In The Book (2015) [Embed] \nAlice (Emily VanCamp) must remain strong when the misfortunes of her past come back to her present. The return of a man from her childhood puts who she is today — and all that she's worked for — on the line. The Girl In The Book will have you fighting alongside her and hanging on for more. 9. Colonia (2015) [Embed] \nLena (Emma Watson) challenges preconceived gender roles when she comes face-to-face with the Colonia Dignidad and takes saving her captured boyfriend into her own hands. Nothing can stop this woman from reuniting with the man she loves. 10. For A Good Time, Call... (2012) [Embed] \nTwo frenemies (played by Lauren Miller and Ari Graynor) are in for the time of their lives when they embrace their sexuality and start a business together. For A Good Time, Call... is a hilarious story of what happens when women help other women — and they don't let the standards of society bring them down. 11. Frances Ha (2012) [Embed] \nSometimes, the love of a friend is the only thing you'll ever need. Frances (Greta Gerwig) is struggling through life in New York City with nothing but the love of her best friend (Mickey Sumner) to guide her. It's a tale of love, life, and finding yourself against all odds. 12. Under The Tuscan Sun (2003) [Embed] \nAre you looking for a bit of change in your life? A newly divorced writer (Diane Lane) takes her own leap of faith when she decides to move to Tuscany and renovate her villa. It's a story about starting over without the fear of failure. 13. Mona Lisa Smile (2003) [Embed] \nJulia Roberts stars as Katherine Ann Watson, an art professor determined to give her students the chance for a better life outside of their all girls institution. This film may be set in the 1950s, but it soon becomes clear that a woman's place isn't just in the home. \nGirl power is shown in a number of different ways, and, thanks to Netflix, these strong female characters are just a click away. \nImages: Revolution Studios ",

( more ) A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.

The comedian will be doing three specials for the streaming service—all scheduled to be released simultaneously in 2017. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy—searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s head of original documentary and comedy, told the The Hollywood Reporter . “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” \nOne of the new shows will be an original stand-up special produced for Netflix and the two others are previously unseen gigs from Chappelle’s own collection, according to THR .

Until today, the identity of that small crew was all we knew about the upcoming Han Solo standalone movie. Now we can add the Mother of Dragons herself to that team: Game of Thrones’ Emilia Clarke has been cast as the film’s female lead. \nIt’s yet another coup for the movie, which takes place before Star Wars: Episode IV—A New Hope and follows the adventures a young Han Solo (Ehrenreich). First, it was big news that Lego Movie directors Lord and Miller were tackling yet another fan-beloved property. Next, Hail Caesar’ s breakout star Ehrenreich landed the title role. Then, in what seemed like a trifecta, Glover came aboard to play Lando Calrissian. Clarke now joins that team. Her character doesn’t yet have a name, but she’ll be part of a “dynamic cast of characters that Han and Chewie will encounter on their adventures.” \nIf there’s a small downside to the casting, it’s that Lord and Miller had been testing other actresses throughout the fall, including Tessa Thompson, Kiersey Clemons, Zoë Kravitz, Naomi Scott, and fellow Game of Thrones cast member Jessica Henwick. Of those floated in Variety’ s story on the casting, Clarke is the only white actress. But considering Clarke must be playing an all-new character, and she’s spent the better part of the last decade playing one of the most confident and powerful female characters on television, she’s a great pick. All that’s left is to make sure Clarke’s role lives up to her abilities. Author: Angela Watercutter. Angela Watercutter Culture Date of Publication: 11.15.16.

After each started their late-night monologues with a “How was your weekend?” quip, they both dove right into the national topic du jour: President-elect Donald Trump’s transition to the White House. Specifically, they took jabs at Trump’s choice for chief of staff , Reince Priebus, by making anagrams of his name. \nOn The Late Show , Colbert called the Republican National Committee chair “Penis Rice a Roni.” And on Full Frontal , Bee rearranged the letters of his name to spell “Eerie R.N.C. Pubis.” (In case you’re wondering, Bee’s example is a legit anagram of Priebus’ name, Colbert’s is not.) In both cases, the jokes got LoLs, but they also got us thinking: Surely there were some great potential Priebus anagrams they didn’t use, right? We took this challenge to Wordsmith.org, which found 9,463 possible outcomes for “Reince Priebus”—while most of those were gibberish, there’s more than one icier pun rebus that Bee and Colbert missed.

The latter was a searing indictment of the former. \nOn Last Week Tonight , Oliver opened the show with an overview of the anxiety that’s been spreading since last Tuesday and from there tore into the possibilities surrounding Trump’s possible Supreme Court nominees , foreign policies , 60 Minutes comments on Obamacare , and appointment of climate-change skeptics to his transition team. He then circled back on how the election turned out the way it did by pointing out the roles Facebook and the polls played in its outcome. He even touched on why Americans shouldn’t move to Canada , saying that instead of absconding “we need to stay here and fight.” \n“Keep reminding yourself: This is not normal,” Oliver told his audience. “Because a Klan-backed , misogynist Internet troll is going to be delivering the next State of the Union address—and that is not normal.” \nOliver closed his show—the last of the year—with a tribute to 2016, collecting man-on-the-street interviews about why this has been “an uncommonly shitty year.” Watch the whole thing above; it’s pretty much the entire election season (and beyond) encapsulated in one TV segment. Whether or not you believe that is up to you, because—as the host notes—after this election “there is no longer a consensus on what a fact is.” Author: Angela Watercutter.

Then we have some good news for you, Ghost in the Shell fans! After teasing the film with a series of very bald cuts back in September, the first full trailer for the manga/anime adaptation dropped today and it is far more visually satisfying. Set to a cover of Depeche Mode’s “Enjoy the Silence” by Ki: Theory, it shows human-cyborg Major (known as Major Motoko Kusanagi in the original Ghost , and played here by Scarlett Johansson) on two missions: to lead the Section 9 task force and to find out who she truly is. (Not shown: Why Johansson was cast to play an Asian character .) The visuals look stunning, the action seems fun, and—incidentally—the humanoid stuff feels a little Westworld -y now. Ghost in the Shell hits theaters March 31, 2017. Until then, enjoy the movie’s first trailer above. Author: K.M. McFarland. K.M. McFarland Culture Date of Publication: 11.10.16. Time of Publication: 4:03 pm. 4:03 pm New Rogue One Trailer: A Fierce Rebellion Begins \nThe fantasy story of a female-led insurgency against a domineering Empire seemed like space opera escapism only a few days ago. But now that people are protesting the election of Donald Trump in cities across the US, Rogue One: A Star Wars Story —and its ragtag group of rebels out to defeat a new regime—feels a lot more au courant than it did just last week. \nWe got the final US trailer last month , but now there’s an international trailer that gives even more information about how Jyn Erso and the rest of her team steal the plans for the Empire’s super weapon. This new trailer is also far more forthcoming about that plot—like, for example, Jyn finally actually utters the words, “Death Star,” and there are shots of the space station moving. It’s kind of terrifying to see it rise in the sky above a planet, get in position for a weapons test, and destroy the surface of it while blotting out the sun. \nLess terrifying are the new shots that flash back to Jyn’s childhood. A woman, presumably Jyn’s mother, puts a necklace with a clear crystal around her neck. Jyn is still wearing that crystal as an adult—part of the mounting evidence that it’s a kyber crystal, the mineral used to create lightsabers, and the raw material the Empire seeks on the planet Jedha to create the main weapon on the Death Star. \nAnd for an orphaned delinquent who gets broken out of prison to lead this team, Jyn is also quite inspiring. At the end of the trailer, she’s imploring an unknown audience, “We’ll take the next chance, and the next, until we win, or the chances are spent.” \nRogue One hits theaters December 16.

Time of Publication: 3:35 am. 3:35 am A photo posted by Sam's Schlegel (@schlegalleria) on Nov 8, 2016 at 10:22pm PST \nDonald Trump was just elected the 45th president of the United States. It was, in every possible way, a stunning victory. So stunning, in fact, that many members of the electorate don’t know how to respond. \nExcept on Instagram. \nAs Trump took the stage early this morning, users of the photo-sharing service began posting flat black images instead of photos. Most of the images don’t have captions so it’s hard to tell the true intent, but the message seems to be that Trump’s win portends dark times ahead. \nThroughout the election, Instagram has been a place for users to post memes, “I Voted” photos (and sometimes their ballots, even if that is legally dubious ), and other messages of political support, so this series of images marks a subdued and stark end to the presidential campaign. It will also likely not be the last trend to hit the photo-sharing site in the coming weeks. Like the Pepe the Frogs and the sniffs and the “This Is Fines” before it, many more memes will follow this black square. Author: K.M. McFarland. K.M. McFarland Culture Date of Publication: 11.03.16.

The Chicago Cubs, a team without a title since 1908, facing off against the Cleveland Indians, who hadn’t won in 68 years. An early lead for the Cubs, then a blown save in the 8th inning as Cleveland tied the game 6-6 on a home run. And as if that didn’t create enough drama as the game headed into extra innings, there was a rain delay. It’s a situation nobody could’ve predicted. \nExcept this guy: 2016 World Series. \nCubs vs Indians \nAnd then the world will end with the score tied in game seven in extra innings #apocalypse \n— GIO (@RaysFanGio) November 4, 2014 \nOne Twitter user, sadly a Cleveland Indians fan, predicted almost this exact scenario back in 2014. The Cubs, the Indians, Game 7, and the rain delay. Thankfully it didn’t end with the apocalypse, and merely the Cubs winning the team’s first World Series in 108 years, bringing the end to the most tortuous title drought in all of sports. But the sudden Twitter fame may be small comfort to the Cleveland fan who made the prediction after the Indians squandered a 3-1 lead in the series. Author: Angela Watercutter.

Case in point: The latest trailer for Wonder Woman , in which the Amazonian warrior princess (played by the actually perfect Gal Gadot) takes the ass-kickery that made her the highlight of Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and turns it up to 11 during World War I. She shoots arrows! She uses her Bracelets of Submission to deflect bullets! She has a friggin’ sword in her dress! She is also not here to take any kind of orders from Steve Trevor (Chris Pine). Check out the new trailer for director Patty Jenkins’ Wonder Woman , which hits theaters June 2, 2017, above. Author: Angela Watercutter. Angela Watercutter Culture Date of Publication: 11.01.16.

      "text": "Netflix has released the first full trailer for the upcoming movie Barry , which gives a look at the life of a young Barack Obama years before he became president.\nNewcomer Devon Terrell stars in the film as the title character alongside Anya Taylor-Joy , who plays an amalgamation of his three, white college girlfriends. \nThe movie will start streaming on December 16!\nHere is the synopsis: A young Barack Obama , known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.\n\nBarry l Official Trailer [HD] l Netflix ",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s Why Analysts Think Netflix Is ‘Unstoppable’ \nCable giants like 21st Century Fox fox and CBS may have aggressively upped their Internet streaming game in a bid to maintain its dominance over television—but it’s already too late, according to a team of Brean Capital analysts. \n“ We believe Netflix has created an unstoppable lead in the Internet TV business and is positioned to dominate the business long term,” wrote analyst Alan Gould, of Brean Capital, in a Monday note. Gould initiated coverage over steaming giant, Netflix nflx , with a “Buy” rating and a price target of $145—a 24% upside to the stock’s valuation as of noon. \nBased on Gould’s analysis, Netflix is projected to increase its subscriber base from 86.7 million to 300 million in 15 years as it gains a secure foothold in international markets. The steady growth in subscribers will be in part thanks to the company’s massive spending on content—$25 billion annually in 10 years based on Brean’s projections—which will act as a “content moat” against competition. \nWhile that spending figure is intimidating, Gould argues that Netflix will be a low cost producer, because those expenses will be spread out across the firm’s hundreds of millions of subscribers. By 2031, Gould predicts Netflix will generate a $19 average revenue per user, 29% earnings before interest and tax margin, and over $25 earnings per share. \n\nGould expects Netflix to return earnings per share of $0.40 on revenue of $8.82 billion for the full 2016 fiscal year. \n“It has minimal distribution costs and as Netflix self- produces more content it eliminates the studio’s margin thereby maximizing the economic profit in the content cycle between production and retail monetization,” Gould’s firm argued. \nNetflix’s only major threat at this point is Amazon amzn , which offers its video service for free to its Prime members, according to Gould.

      "text": "a year in the life Share this article \nOn Friday, Nov. 25, Gilmore Girls returns to Netflix for a four-episode revival. While most people are out shopping on Black Friday, my mom and I will be curled up on the couch with a cup of hot chocolate watching the revival. \nWhen I first heard Netflix was going to release four brand new episodes, I was more than excited. It was like I was a kid again. I grew up coming home from softball practice, eating dinner and watching the show with my mom. It was our thing. Our show. We were Jodi and Ang by day, but for one hour each night we were Lorelai and Rory. We truly bonded over the show. It brought us closer together, like I’m sure it did to many other mothers and daughters around the country. \nI grew up in a small town, and I think that was the most intriguing part of the show. I could relate to the small town aspect. I decided that I could be like Rory and go to college. I started writing for Her Campus Lasell - my Yale Daily News. I’m obsessed with coffee, my mom is my best friend, and I am driven and goal-oriented just like Rory. My mom is just like Lorelai (except she cooks LOL). She cares, is helpful and backs my dreams 100 percent, but can also be a hardass when she needs to. \nI call my mom at night after class and the first thing she says nine out of 10 times is, “I’m watching Gilmore Girls .” Together, we have watched the series probably over 10 times. She comes home from work now, turns on the television, and watches reruns. I come home from class, open my computer, and continue where I left off on Netflix. We get excited when we happen to be watching the same episode. \nWhen my mom heard about the revival and the date still wasn’t released, she requested that I take the day off of work or school - whichever I happened to have - and come home to watch it with her. Thankfully, with the revival being on Black Friday, I’ll be home for Thanksgiving break. \nMy mom and I have had ample discussion on who we think Rory will end up with (my bet is on Logan, although I’m a Dean fan). We’ve planned out the entire day of the release (legit sitting on our butts all day watching and rewatching the revival). We’ve planned out what we are going to eat (unfortunately, we can’t eat like Lorelai and Rory, but we’ll probably be stuffing our faces with Thanksgiving leftovers). \nThank you Netflix, Amy Sherman-Palladino, and the entire Gilmore Girls cast for giving my mom and I another opportunity to sing along to the theme song, live vicariously through Lorelai and Rory, and spend some much needed quality time together.",

      "text": "Twitter \nIn its short life as a content creator, Netflix has delivered some outstanding series. Netflix Originals such as House of Cards , Orange is the New Black and Stranger Things ( what to watch after finishing Stranger Things ) have all received praise from viewers and critics alike. \nWhile the streaming company is facing more than $3 billion in long-term debt , it plans to continue investing heavily in original content , which is good news for subscribers who have enjoyed the Netflix Originals released so far. \nWith that in mind, here are seven original Netflix series you should watch right now. Assuming you have already watched our other favorite Netflix Originals 13 New Netflix Originals You'll Be Watching in 2016 13 New Netflix Originals You'll Be Watching in 2016 Netflix has released a lot of original content -- including House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Narcos, and Master of None -- but 2016 is slated to be Netflix's most exciting year yet. Read More . 1. Easy \nFrom writer and producer Joe Swanberg, Easy is an anthology series that falls into the “dramedy” genre. Each of the show’s half-hour long episodes features different actors while focusing on different stories. \nThe program includes some fairly big-name talent, including Marc Maron, Emily Ratajkowski, Orlando Bloom, Hannibal Buress, and Dave Franco. \nWatch Easy on Netflix 2. Haters Back Off \nThe comedy Haters Back Off is based on the popular YouTube character Miranda Sings , played by actress and comedienne Colleen Ballinger. \nThe Netflix series focuses on Miranda’s family life, giving a bit of background on how a relatively talentless and extremely self-absorbed youngster looks for fame on the internet. The series follows Miranda from the time when she uploads her first video online until one goes viral. \nOthers in the series include Angela Kinsey as Miranda’s mother, Steve Little as Miranda’s uncle, Francesca Reale as Miranda’s sister, and Erik Stocklin as Miranda’s best friend. \nIf you’ve previously found yourself clicking around YouTube in search of Miranda Sings videos — which have been around since 2008 — this show has literally been made for you. \nWatch Haters Back Off on Netflix 3. Lovesick (Previously Scrotal Recall) \nIt’s not a huge mystery why Netflix opted to change the name of this series, which originally aired in 2015 to open-minded albeit confused viewers. Scrotal Recall , while maybe a funny pun obviously based on the Schwarzenegger movie Total Recall , has nothing to do with implanted memories, space travel, or secret agents. \nIt does, however, convey the surprisingly charming story of a young adult who finds out he has an STD and has to tell all of his past sexual partners about it so they can get tested. \nNow more appropriately named Lovesick , this English rom-com drama is a must-see. \nWatch Lovesick on Netflix 4. Bloodline \nThe drama thriller Bloodline is summed up nicely by its tagline: “We’re not bad people, but we did a bad thing.” \nThe program revolves around the dysfunctional Rayburn family, notably oldest child and black sheep Danny Rayburn. When Danny decides he wants to return closer to his family and help his parents at their inn, his siblings vote against it. Things happen. Family secrets unfold. \nKyle Chandler, Linda Cardellini, and Norbert Leo Butz are among the stars, with others including Sissy Spacek, Ben Mendelsohn, and John Leguizamo. \nIf you like darker suspense dramas in the vein of House of Cards or The Killing , Bloodline might be for you. \nWatch Bloodline on Netflix 5. Grace and Frankie \nCreated by Marta Kauffman of Friends fame, Grace and Frankie stars Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin as two women who become friends after their husbands surprisingly announce they’re in love and plan to marry each other. \nOne of the strengths of Grace and Frankie is the experience of its cast. In addition to Fonda and Tomlin, actors Martin Sheen and Sam Waterston also star. Brooklyn Decker, Ethan Embry, and Baron Vaughn are among those in supporting roles. \nThe show is a somewhat unconventional and quirky comedy. If you liked Netflix’s own Master of None or Love , you’ll want to check out Grace and Frankie . \nWatch Grace and Frankie on Netflix 6. Sense8 \nThe intriguing sci-fi drama Sense8 follows eight strangers from all over the world who suddenly become mentally and emotionally linked. The show’s creators, Lana and Lilly Wachowski and J. Michael Straczynski, wanted to create a science fiction series 6 New (ish) Science Fiction Movies Better Than Star Wars 6 New (ish) Science Fiction Movies Better Than Star Wars Is Star Wars really the pinnacle of science fiction movies set in space? Haven't several films already surpassed the Star Wars series? Here are six we consider to be better... Read More that touches on topics not commonly found in the genre, including politics, religion, gender, and sexuality. \nThe series features an ensemble cast, including Tuppence Middleton, Brian J. Smith, Doona Bae, Aml Ameen, and Jamie Clayton. Others who appear include Daryl Hannah, Naveen Andrews, and Terrence Mann. \nFans of mysterious sci-fi series such as Lost or Stranger Things will likely enjoy Sense8 as well. \nWatch Sense8 on Netflix 7. Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp \nNetflix’s Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp is a prequel to the 2001 cult classic movie 12 Cult Movies Everyone Should Watch on Netflix 12 Cult Movies Everyone Should Watch on Netflix There are so many cult movies to choose from it's hard to know where to begin. Thankfully, Netflix has some choice selections to get you started. Read More Wet Hot American Summer , itself a parody of 1980s-era teen sex comedies. \nThe show features a large ensemble cast that includes a number of big names, including Elizabeth Banks, Bradley Cooper, Christopher Meloni, David Hyde Pierce, Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, Jason Schwartzman, and Molly Shannon. \nThe prequel series was well-received, leading to the sequel series titled Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later . \nIf you’re a fan of the original movie, you’ll want to put Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp on your viewing list immediately. \nWatch Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp on Netflix What Shows Will You Binge This Weekend? \nIf you’re planning to start and finish a Netflix original this weekend, the suggestions on this list are a good place to start. \nIf you plan to lock down some “me time” for your marathon, consider watching Easy or Lovesick as both tend to be a bit more adult-themed than the other shows on this list, which could make watching them with certain friends awkward. \nHowever, if you’re going to buddy up for a binge-watching session, Wet Hot American Summer , Haters Back Off , and Grace and Frankie are all casual, funny shows. These are perfect for watching when you have friends over, because they’re entertaining but also easy to pause or tune out if you plan to chat and eat, etc. \nAnd if you’re planning to hole up with a serious TV buff like yourself for some intense, don’t-miss-a-second binging, go with Bloodline or Sense8 . These shows are more detail-driven, with plenty of drama to keep you guessing. \nWhat other Netflix originals would you recommend your fellow readers watch right now?

Netflix's upcoming Barry biopic details young Obama's formative years at Columbia University in New York City. The first full-length trailer dropped Monday (November 21) after a teaser was released last month. \nThe film follows Obama (Devon Terrell) during the ins-and-outs of his junior year. There are many glimpses into familiar college life: dimly lit parties, bright classrooms, and surprise visits from parents. Let Obama introduce you to his world: \nBut as the trailer shows, college brings racial tensions into Obama's life, too. When a campus officer asks him for an ID, he asks why the officer isn't IDing anyone else. Even in college, he was never afraid to speak his mind. \nBarry premieres on Netflix December 16.",

      "text": "swruler9284/flickr Back in August, Netflix added a couple of political movies to its streaming service. The first was Funny or Die Presents: Donald Trump's The Art of the Deal: The Movie —an entertaining, extended jab at this year's GOP presidential nominee. The second was Al Gore's documentary, An Inconvenient Truth .\nRELATED ARTICLES Kamala Harris So Concerned About Trump Threat She Wants to Make It Harder to Criticize Him Ed Krayewski | 11.21.16 \nLena Dunham Goes Hardcore Cultural Appropriation In Pro-Hillary Clinton Rap Video Anthony L.

And yet to three members of the Federal Election Commission, it is anything but.\nThe FEC is split evenly between Republicans and Democrats. This leads to many stalemates and causes much teeth-grinding rage among those who would like it to crack down harder on political speech, especially by incorporated nonprofits such as the NRA and Planned Parenthood , which spend money on elections without disclosing their donors.\nIn the instance at hand, it was not the Republicans but the Democrats who shrank from endorsing what should be the fundamental right to distribute movies. After all, the Supreme Court has made it plain that \"moving pictures, like newspapers and radio, are included in the press whose freedom is guaranteed by the First Amendment.\"\nRegarding that point Lee Goodman, one of the three Republican members (and a former counsel to the Virginia GOP), recently tried to have some language—just a few words, actually—inserted into a notice of proposed rulemaking. The language would have made it clear that the \"press exemption\" in campaign-finance regulations applies not only to newspapers, magazines, and TV but also to movies, books, and streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime.\nThat campaign-finance regulations have a \"press exemption\" in the first place is what poker players would call a tell, and what you and I would call a dead giveaway. The exemption is necessary because without it newspapers, TV networks, and similar media would routinely be in violation of the law whenever they carried anything that might be construed as support for, or opposition to, a political candidate. They are, after all, corporations—and campaign finance laws strictly limit corporate involvement in elections.\nThe media exemption helps explain why most coverage of campaign-finance regulation paints it as woefully inadequate: Media organizations can agitate for restrictions on political speech by other types of corporations, secure in the knowledge that they enjoy special protection from the rules that apply to everyone else.\nBut that could change if the makeup of the FEC ever changes. When The New York Times lashed out at the FEC for being an \"impotent joke\" and demanded that it be replaced by a new agency—one that can be stacked in favor of more regulation—FEC Commissioner Ann Ravel tweeted , \"Finally: my concerns are being heard.\" (Translation: Head of Government Agency Agrees Government Agency Should Have More Power.)\nWhen Goodman proposed language stipulating that books, movies, and streaming services should be treated according to the same First Amendment principles that protect newspapers and magazines, Ravel joined her two Democratic colleagues in opposition.\nRavel claimed she was concerned about timing: \"None of us have had an opportunity to really review and think about\" Goodman's proposal, she said. First, that wasn't true; Goodman had circulated it months before. More importantly, how much reviewing and thinking should be needed to agree that books and movies are covered by the First Amendment?\nQuite a lot, apparently. In another recent case, a right-wing movie-maker made a movie, \"Dreams From My Real Father,\" contending that Barack Obama is really the son of a communist, and then mailed millions of copies to voters in swing states. (The premise was so ridiculous that it actually turned off Republicans in a focus group.)\nWhen a complaint against the movie was lodged at the FEC, the three Republican commissioners ruled that it was covered by the media exemption. The three Democratic commissioners ruled otherwise. One of them, Ellen Weintraub, explained her reasoning succinctly: Noting that the press exception depends on \"whether the press entity was acting as a press entity,\" she asserted that \"press entities do not act as press entities when they distribute millions of free DVDs immediately before an election solely in electoral swing states.\" Oh? What about free newspapers? Free magazines?\nIn a June case this year, the FEC took up the question as to whether Fox News' two-tiered arrangement during its Aug. 6 debate last year violated federal regulations. Two commissioners—Ravel and Steven Walther, another member of the Democratic bloc—voted to take enforcement action against Fox. A subsequent vote on a measure stipulating that the FEC lacks the authority to regulate how news organizations run debates failed on a 3-3 partisan vote.\nAll of this should alarm members of the media for two reasons. First, newspapers are now producing video on a regular basis.\nThey also publish books, such as the Washington Post 's \" Trump Revealed \" (available on Amazon, at Barnes & Noble, and on Audible). Such works include news content, but then so do many other movies and books produced by non-media sources. It is not clear why the former should be exempt from regulation if the latter are not.\nThe other reason to be alarmed is that the Democratic members of the FEC seem to think they can, as Goodman puts it, \"sit in judgment of ... news directors' editorial criteria\"—and that while they can do so only rarely at present, they would like to do it much more.\nThey might just get the chance. Hillary Clinton has promised that, if elected, she will propose a constitutional amendment in her first 30 days so that the First Amendment no longer can limit the reach of campaign-finance law. If she does, the media might finally wake up to the implications of such a proposal. But by that point, it might be too late.\nThis column originally appeared at the Richmond Times-Dispatch.\nPhoto Credit: swruler9284/flickr",

Updated: November 21, 2016 — 4:05 PM EST 13 Share Ellen Gray Television Critic \nEllen Gray is the television critic for the Daily News and the Inquirer, and has written about TV since 1994. Her mind will go blank if you ask her to name her favorite show, because she has so many, but she would love to hear about yours. \nFind her columns here . Nov 11 \nI should have known Amy Sherman-Palladino would have something to say about Marie Kondo. \nBecause the Gilmore Girls creator, who never met a scene into which she couldn't squeeze just one more idea, cultural reference, or sight gag, was unlikely to be an acolyte of the decluttering Kondo, author of the best-selling The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up . \nOn Friday, with the release on Netflix of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , you can see how Kondo, Uber, and other post-2007 phenomena figure in a world in which mother-daughter vaudeville team Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) are free again to trade witticisms for four 90-minute episodes. \nPrepare, though, to be at least a little disappointed. \nKondo might advise letting go of things that don't bring you joy, but I'd argue it's sometimes best to let go of the things that do bring joy, if only so they may continue to. \nBecause of Netflix, we can have more Arrested Developmen t, more Full House -- the second season of Fuller House premieres Dec. 9 -- and now more Lorelai and Rory, but haven't we all seen enough zombie shows to know it's better to let some things rest? \nBesides, the only thing harder than returning to a beloved place to find everything changed is arriving to find not nearly enough has. \n\nThe problem isn't the frozen-in-time Stars Hollow. The fictional Connecticut town where Lorelai raised Rory always existed in its own dimension. It's a wonder it can be reached by car and not some New England version of the Hogwarts Express. \nIf all that's been missing from your TV life since Gilmore Girl s left the air were get-rich-quick schemes from Kirk (Sean Gunn) and absurdist town meetings chaired by Taylor (Michael Winters), prepare to be overjoyed, even overserved. \nFor me, it's the main characters who matter, and though they've aged, however imperceptibly, they haven't grown as much as I'd hoped in the years since Lorelai was reunited with Luke (Haddonfield's Scott Patterson) and since Rory, newly sprung from Yale, went off to cover the presidential campaign of some guy named Barack Obama. \nIn fairness to Sherman-Palladino, who shared writing and directing duties on A Year in the Life with with her husband, Daniel Palladino, the 2007 finale that set up those happily-ever-after scenarios wasn't hers. The couple had left the show before its seventh season, on the then-new CW network. \nShe was, however, responsible for the Money Is No Object fantasy of the entire series, and that continues, disappointingly, in its Netflix afterlife. \nWithout giving away any of the several plot points Netflix is hoping will surprise viewers, I can say that over four TV-movie-length episodes, the story wanders into more than one expensive cul-de-sac and that far more attention seems to have been paid to finding something for a legion of returning actors to do than in forming a coherent narrative. \nThe format -- the equivalent of eight TV episodes in four seasonal chunks -- doesn't serve the material very well and makes bingeing less tempting than usual. \nOn the plus side: There are some fun developments on the minor-character front (and a few surprising cameos); Kelly Bishop's Emily Gilmore gets to wear jeans; and the late Edward Herrmann , who played Lorelai's father and Emily's husband, gets a richly deserved send-off. \nIf only I could say the same for the show itself.

      "text": "LookCatalog.com 1. When he’s busy watching Netflix or playing video games, slip into your sexiest lingerie and walk around the house wearing it. It won’t be long until he notices and abandons the television to focus on you.\n2. Put your hand on his leg while you’re watching a movie, and gradually creep closer to his junk until you’re making him hard through his jeans.\n3. Text him about all of the naughty things you want him to do to you later, so he knows he should take his clothes off as soon as he walks through your door.\n4. Instead of taking the time to write out seductive sexts, just send him a picture of your naked body. No caption necessary.\n5. Guide his hand to your pussy, so he can see how wet you are.\n6. Lean over and give him a passionate kiss filled with tongue and hair tugging. The type of kiss that’ll make it abundantly clear that you’re in the mood.\n7. Call him into the bedroom, so he can catch you masturbating. It’ll be an instant turn-on for him.\n8. Get dressed, or get undressed, right in front of him. Make sure you do it slowly and make eye contact with him, so he knows you’re in a frisky mood.\n9. When you’re ready to hop in the shower, ask him to join you. He’ll know what it means.\n10. Instead of wearing your sweatpants to bed, wear something silky or lacy. Even better, don’t wear anything at all.\n11. Give him “that” look. If you’ve been dating for long enough, then he’ll be able to tell that you’re horny by your eyes alone.\n12. Grab his hand and move it toward your tits or your ass. He’ll take it from there.\n13. Or, if you want to be a little more subtle, grab his hand and lead him toward the bedroom.\n14. Exercise, or at least stretch, in front of him. He’ll go crazy once he sees you bending into Downward Dog in your super tight yoga pants.\n15. Light candles and place them around the room to create a romantic atmosphere. Boys like to be wooed, too.\n16. Put on a porno and have him catch you watching it. Then invite him to watch the rest with you.\n17. Leave your sex toys out on the bed. That way, he’ll get the hint that you’re dying to use them.\n18. Challenge him to a game of Poker or Mario Kart, and claim that the winner gets to choose where to fuck. You’ll definitely have sex after that.\n19. Sit on his lap. You don’t have to do much else. Sex will naturally occur.\n20. Come up with a code word you can slip into conversation whenever you’re horny. That way, you won’t actually have to say the words.\n21. Mark it on the wall calendar. There’s no mistaking what “fuck me at 7:00” means.\n22. If he doesn’t actually own a calendar, steal his phone and set an alarm that says “fuck me.” As soon as it goes off, he’ll get on top of you.\n23. Unzip his jeans and go down on him. He certainly won’t complain.\n24. Buy an adult board game and ask him to play it with you.\n25. Turn on a seductive song and then give him the best lap dance you can.\n26. Casually mention how hot the room is and follow it up by casually removing your shirt. He should take care of the rest.\n27. Be blunt. Tell him you’re horny as fuck and you want him to bang you on the first table he can find. He’ll be happy to oblige. \n",

      "text": "‘You Know What That Makes You??’ Promo For Netflix’ Young Barack Obama Movie BARRY!! Published at: Nov. 21, 2016, 7:44 p.m. CST by hercules \nThis is not “Southside With You,” which depicts Young Barack Obama In Chicago. This is its prequel, “Barry,” which depicts Young Barack Obama in New York. One wonders how many movies they’re going to make about our 44th president. How many Lincoln movies have there been? In 150 years will our descendants be lining up to see stuff like “Barack Obama: Wizard Slayer”? \nPress release! A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. Only on Netflix December 16.",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 NEW YORK (AP) -- British and German TV productions each won three International Emmys Monday night, including acting honors for Dustin Hoffman and Christiane Paul. The centerpiece of the awards ceremony at the Hilton New York came when Tony Goldwyn, who stars as President Fitzgerald Grant in the Washington drama \"Scandal,\" presented the honorary International Emmy Founders Award to the show's creator, producer and writer Shonda Rhimes, who also brought such hits as \"Grey's Anatomy\" and \"How to Get Away with Murder\" to the small screen. Hoffman received the award for best performance by an actor for the BBC One TV movie \"Roald Dahl's Esio Trot.\" The Oscar-winning actor portrayed a lonely retired bachelor who hatches an audacious plan to woo the widow in the flat below who is overly fond of her pet tortoise. Germany's Paul garnered the best actress award for her performance in \"Untern Radar\" (\"Under the Radar\") as a judge whose life is upended when her daughter is suspected of being responsible for a bombing in Berlin. A total of 40 nominees from 15 countries competed in 10 categories for International Emmys, which honor excellence in TV programming outside the U.S. The ceremony was hosted by \"The Good Wife\" star Alan Cumming. Britain's \"Hoff the Record,\" with former \"Baywatch\" star David Hasselhoff playing a fictionalized, over-the-top version of himself, won in the comedy category. \"Capital,\" about residents of a South London suburb whose lives are impacted when their homes become valued at several million pounds in a soaring property market, won the award for TV movie/mini-series. Germany also won Emmys for drama series for \"Deutschland 83,\" the story of an East German spy who infiltrates the West German army to steal NATO secrets. The award in the documentary category went to \"Krieg der Lugen\" (\"War of Lies\"), about an Iraqi refugee whose information about weapons of mass destruction passed through Western intelligence agencies and ultimately was used by the U.S. to help justify the 2003 invasion of Iraq. The award for arts programming went to Japan's \"The Man Who Shot Hiroshima,\" which looks at Hollywood cinematographer Harry Mimura who returned to his native Japan before World War II and later was hired by the U.S. government to shoot footage of life in the Japanese city months after it was devastated by an atomic bomb. Sweden's \"Allt for Sverige\" (\"The Great Swedish Adventure\") received the award for non-scripted entertainment. The reality TV show featured Swedish-Americans returning to the land of their roots for the first time to compete in events connected to Swedish traditions. Other awards went to Brazil's \"Verdades Secretas\" (\"Hidden Truths\") for best telenovela, and to \"Francisco, El Jesuita\" (\"Francis, the Jesuit\"), the story of the man who became the first pope from Latin America, for non-English language, U.S. primetime program. Danish actress Birgitte Hjort Sorensen presented the honorary International Emmy Directorate Award to Maria Rorbye Ronn, chief executive officer and director general of the Danish Broadcasting Corporation, who pioneered the success of Nordic Noir drama around the world.

      "text": "A ‘Netflix for Education’? Why LinkedIn’s New Product Should Give Us Pause By Phil Hill November 22, 2016 \nT his fall LinkedIn introduced a new product that brings together courses from Lynda.com, an online-training company it purchased last year, and LinkedIn’s rich data on job needs and job seekers. LinkedIn Learning, as it’s called, essentially provides a recommendation engine for Lynda.com courses and video segments. As described in a company blog post: \"We have a unique view of how jobs, industries, organizations and skills evolve over time. From this, we can identify the skills you need and deliver expert-led courses to help you obtain those skills. We’re taking the guesswork out of learning.\" \nThat’s a grand vision. To LinkedIn’s credit, the company has not fallen for the \"we’re going to displace higher education\" fantasies that powered the worst of the MOOC craze. But it’s still stuck on the idea that idealized chunks of content are equivalent to learning. \nYes, the primary audience for LinkedIn Learning is job seekers and corporate trainers. But those of us in higher education should care. The challenges of better preparing students for their working lives and filling in skill gaps are ones that colleges and universities are also trying to meet, often through graduate schools or continuing-education departments. Lifelong learning is particularly important to alumni. The New Education Landscape \nThe Chronicle of Higher Education ’s Re:Learning project provides stories and analysis about this changing moment for learning. Listen to the podcast In addition, LinkedIn Learning is targeting higher education as a secondary market. It intends to provide skills training (how to use a learning-management system, for example) to faculty and staff members, and to provide content that can be used in flipped classrooms. More broadly, LinkedIn’s vision is to build what it calls the Economic Graph — an attempt to create profiles for every member of the work force, every company, and \"every job and every skill required to obtain those jobs.\" If the company succeeds, then higher education in general will feel enormous pressure to play within these concepts.\nA standard LinkedIn Learning course consists of a list of chapters, each containing short video segments with synchronized transcripts. Sometimes, but not always, there will be a short multiple-choice quiz. A learner who misses a quiz question receives a suggestion to rewatch the relevant video segment. Many courses also provide downloadable suggestions for exercises the learner can perform on their own. That’s it. No additional assignments, no interactivity, no readings. (A course designer could take that video content and pull it into a richer environment, flipped-classroom-style, but that usage goes outside of the data-and-recommendations-engine model.) \nExecutives at LinkedIn and Lynda.com have described LinkedIn Learning as a cornerstone of the Economic Graph — a service that ties other aspects of their grand plan together. But they acknowledge that the roughly 9,000 courses on Lynda.com are not sufficient to achieve that goal. When I asked a company representative whether LinkedIn would take on other types of content from outside Lynda.com, the answer was no. Instead, the plan would be to use LinkedIn data — the job skills that the Economic Graph determines are necessary, based on corporate or local needs — to guide Lynda.com to create missing content. In other words, LinkedIn believes that one type of course — based on short video segments and short multiple-choice quizzes — is what it needs to develop knowledge and skills. \nFrom a pedagogical standpoint, the LinkedIn Learning platform is a very limiting one. How, for example, would teachers take the content and adapt it to the learning experience best suited for their region? How would companies apply their own learning design to the material? LinkedIn makes some nods to customization — it allows its enterprise customers to create their own playlists of Lynda.com courses and video segments, for example — but it can’t offer flexibility when it comes to the overall pedagogical approach. \nThe company doesn’t explicitly make this claim, but LinkedIn Learning has the look of an effort to be another Netflix of education. If we can just create consumable content chunks and then apply data science to deliver the right chunk at the right time to the right person, the thinking goes, then we’ll achieve nirvana.

      "title": "How to explain why you’re ignoring your family to watch ‘Gilmore Girls’ on Thanksgiving weekend",
      "text": " @emilyyahr\nFrom left, Lorelai, Rory and Luke on “Gilmore Girls.” (Netflix) When Netflix announced that the release date for the “Gilmore Life” revival would be Nov. 25, the day after Thanksgiving, one fact became clear: Many relatives will be ignored during this holiday.\nThe most-anticipated show of the year will land on Netflix at 3:01 a.m. ET on Friday, and it’s not a stretch to say that quite a few people will wake up the next morning and immediately start streaming the series, which is four 90-minute episodes. Sorry, parents who need help cleaning the kitchen or cousins who want to go Black Friday shopping — “Gilmore Girls” is top priority.\nIf you need help explaining to your family why you’re barricading yourself in your room on Friday, and potentially into the weekend, here’s a guide, with questions from the perspective of a non-“Gilmore Girls” viewer:\n[ REVIEW |\nQ: Why is the Internet melting down over this revival? Don’t old TV shows come back all the time these days?\nA: Fair point! But “Gilmore Girls” is still a pretty big deal. The show went off-air in 2007 after the seventh and final season, but the ending was a huge disappointment for fans. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Dan Palladino, walked away after the sixth season when they couldn’t come to a financial agreement with the studio . It was complicated.\nWhere is Lane's dad? Why don't Lorelai and Rory ever pay for their food? Perhaps these questions will be answered in the \"Gilmore Girls\" revival coming to Netflix. (Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post) Q: Why is that a big deal?\nA: Not to get too cliche here, but the Palladinos were the heart and soul of the series. “Gilmore Girls” is known (and loved) for its rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue filled with pop-culture references, and it takes a very specific person to carry that voice.\n“It’s horrifying. It’s like a freaking nightmare,” Sherman-Palladino said in response to passing off the show to a new executive producer for the final season. Yet that’s what happened — and it was too obvious in the seventh season that new people were in charge. The dialogue dragged, storylines were nonsense, and a beloved series limped away to the disappointment of a fiercely loyal fanbase.\nAnyway, the Palladinos are back in charge of the revival. This is very exciting closure for fans, because now they’ll be able to see the end of the series the way the creator originally intended. Also, for years, Sherman-Palladino has teased that she’s always known what the last four words of the show would be; the mystery surrounding the final line has reached almost mythical status . Mythical!\nFrom left, Kelly Bishop, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel Life.” (Robert Voets/Netflix) Q: So what’s the show about again?\nA: I would be shocked that you asked that, except as my friend Nick recently put it, “Sure, I know the Gilmore girls. Lisa Gilmore and Juanita Gilmore. One’s a mom, one’s a girl, something something Yale.”\nUh, close. “Gilmore Girls” is about the adventures of Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel), a quirky mother-daughter duo who are best friends. They live in a small, dreamy New England town. Lorelai got pregnant when she was 16, which caused a lifelong rift with her wealthy, traditional parents, and she ran away from home once Rory was born. The series starts as Rory is 16 and gets into a fancy private school, and Lorelai is forced to ask her parents for money for Rory’s tuition. They say yes, but as a condition, her mother (Kelly Bishop) insists that they come to dinner every Friday night. And so the generational drama begins. (And yes, Rory eventually goes to Yale.)\nQ: Why are people still so excited about a show that ended almost 10 years ago?\nA: I could write a book about why “Gilmore Girls” is so magical, but in practical terms, the show got a second life a couple years ago when Netflix made all seven seasons available. The enormous response showed Netflix executives that they should probably capitalize on this momentum (there’s basically a cottage industry of “Gilmore Girls” memorabilia, GIFs, quizzes and thinkpieces) and order up a revival.\nQ: Can I watch it if I’ve never seen the show before?\nA: The revival is almost 100 percent fan service, full of inside jokes and callbacks to the original show. But if you want to spend time with your family member who is ignoring you, go for it! You just might not understand anything — and you might not want to interrupt with questions.\nRead more:\n‘Gilmore Girls’ on Netflix: A refresher (and rating) on each season\nThe first ‘Gilmore Girls’ trailer reveals these five important facts\n ",

      "text": " @bethoniebutler\nNostalgia, four ways. Clockwise from top left: The youngsters of “Stranger Things” (Netflix); the Beatles-singing “Beat Bugs” (Netflix); Rory and Lorelei Gilmore Life” (Saeed Adyani/Netflix); and a scene from “Voltron: Legendary Defender” (Netflix). Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop saga “The Get Down” and the ’80s-era phenomenon that is “Stranger Things,” the streaming network has revamped animated kids’ favorites such as “Popples” and “Voltron” and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel “The Little Prince.” “Beat Bugs,” another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release “ Gilmore Life ,” a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show “Gilmore Girls,” on Friday.\n[\nOf course, Netflix isn’t the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming , resurfacing popular teen shows such as “All That” and “Clarissa Explains It All” in 2011. But that was before the days of “peak TV ” and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix’s early DVD mailers ) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia’s reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network’s ambitious plans for original content.\n“We’re looking, always, for the great stories,” said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. “We’re not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.”\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films . Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n[ Dave Chappelle’s comeback to television continues with three Netflix specials ]\n“Stranger Things” wasn’t a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late ’70s and ’80s, including Ridley Scott’s “Alien,” Rob Reiner’s 1986 film “Stand By Me” and ’80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including “E.T.” Similarly, “The Get Down” added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\n“Stranger Things” was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network “definitely knew we had something special” after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\n[ ‘Stranger Things’ won over most viewers in just two episodes, according to Netflix ]\nSarandos said “Stranger Things” is popular on a global scale, although that’s difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn’t share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers “with incredible granularity,” but it doesn’t consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn’t sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that “Stranger Things” and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show’s dedicated fan base. “ There’s no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,” Sarandos said. (If you’re still skeptical, take a moment to read about the Internet’s dear friend Barb .)\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. “Full House” and “Gilmore Girls” both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. And Netflix isn’t just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived “Rush Hour” reboot — “Fuller House” and the “Gilmore Girls” miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven’t succeeded, at times, with the remake format — “MacGyver” has done well on Friday night for CBS, “Lethal Weapon” has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and “The Exorcist,” which isn’t a ratings hit , is surprisingly worth watching if you’re a fan of the horror genre.)\n[ TV ]\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in “Stranger Things” and “The Get Down.” “It’s all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,” he said, using the rotary phones in “Stranger Things” as an example.\n“My 20-year-old son never said ‘What’s that?’ because h e’s so used to seeing it [on] film and television,” Sarandos said. “It’s almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.”\nRelated:\n TV\nIn a dismal movie season, Netflix’s ‘Stranger Things’ is our great summer blockbuster",

      "text": "Netflix is finally bringing 4K streaming to desktops, allowing fans to watch their favorite content in Ultra HD on a compatible monitor. But before you get too excited, there is a catch that means the feature is only available to a small number of people right now.\nNetflix has previously avoided making its 4K content available on PC due to piracy concerns. It’s much easier to rip content from the service on a desktop, and the company has been looking to ensure that customers have to pay to enjoy super-sharp TV shows.\nNow the company has changed its stance, and it’s finally streaming Ultra HD content exclusively (for now) on Windows 10 through Microsoft Edge. However, to get it, you’ll need a PC powered by Intel’s seventh-generation Kaby Lake processors.\nKaby Lake is hard to come by Those processors are still pretty difficult to come by. Kaby Lake desktops and notebooks are only just hitting the market, and they’re still pricey. What’s more, the CPUs are still only available to PC manufacturers, which means you can’t yet buy them for custom builds.\nEven if you have a powerful rig that’s more than capable of streaming 4K video, then, Netflix in Ultra HD is likely still out of reach for now. But this is definitely a step in the right direction, and it’s likely Netflix will made 4K more widely available in the future.\n\n\nSource : Microsoft \nVia : Pocket-lint ",

      "text": "Netflix 'Gilmore Girls' mini-series: Looking back, looking ahead Sonja Haller , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:03 a.m. MST November 22, 2016 \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" premieres on Netflix Nov. 25. (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix) \nMaybe you have been on the edge of your seat for 10 years. \nThat's how long it's been since we last left the kooky but lovable cast of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Remember the final, unsatisfying storylines? Diehard fans will, but some of us won't. \nWhat happened with Lorelai's love life? \nRory graduated college. Harvard, right? No, that would be Yale. \nKeiko got married to that musician? \nBelow is a primer for where things stood when we last left the show, and what we hope will happen character by character when \"The Gilmore Girls: A Year in The Life\" premieres on Netflix just after midnight on Friday, Nov. 25 \nThe show ran for seven seasons, 2000 to 2007. The new mini-series is four episodes. Facebook Posted! A link has been posted to your Facebook feed. Our sweet, bookworm Rory (Alexis Bledel) grew up in front of our eyes. She lost the mall bangs but remains a stunner. Getty Images/SaeedAdyaniNetflix Lorelai (Lauren Graham) has the same enviable mane and round face that keeps her young looking. Warner Bros./Saeed Adyani, Netflix Flannel then. Flannel now. Not much has changed for Luke (Scott Patterson.) Here's hoping our good-ol'-grump stays the same always. Warner Bros./Saeed Adyani, Netflix Lookin' good girl! Our haughty lady, Emily (Kelly Bishop), might not appreciate the cat call. She's a classy lady and looks the part. Getty Images/Saeed Adyani, Netflix Lane (Keiko Agena) always had a quirky style. Let's hope \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" returns Lane to her funky roots. Warner Bros./Rodrigo Vaz,FilmMagic Bad-boy Jess returns for the reboot. Let's hope his mustache doesn't! Warner Bros./Getty Images Rory's father Christopher (David Sutcliffe) was in a word: frustrating. Was he a good guy? A bad guy? Of course, he looked good then and he looks good now. Warner Bros./Getty Images Kooky Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) returns for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" on Nov. 25. Warner Bros./Getty Images Paris (Liza Weil), our bossy little prep school gal is now a sophisticated grown up on her way to med school. Or is she? Watch Netflix Nov. 25th to find out. Warner Bros./Getty Images Good-guy Dean (Jared Padalecki) was Rory's first love. Looks like he's got a little bad boy in him now. Warner Bros./Getty Images Like this topic? You may also like these photo galleries: Replay Last Slide Next Slide Lorelai (Lauren Graham) \nWhat happened: Lorelai helped Rory pack for college and tried to deal with the emotions of being an empty nester. She learned that it was Luke, her former fiance, who organized the memorable going away party for Rory. They shared an ambiguous kiss, but it gave us hope. Meanwhile, she was finally on good terms with her parents. The Dragonfly Inn was prosperous and entertaining offers from a hotel chain. \nWhat we hope will happen: Luke and Lorelai 4ever! Why not? They had seven seasons where we could see they were made for each other, bust somehow they couldn't. The couple are committed. Maybe we'll see an unplanned pregnancy to ratchet up the drama. The trailer hints that Lorelai is not as confident with the Dragonfly as she once was. Rory (Alexis Bledel) \nWhat happened: Rory graduated from Yale, not Harvard, as was her childhood dream. She went to work as an online reporter for a magazine where she was assigned to cover then-Sen. Barack Obama on the presidential campaign trail. She also turned down the marriage proposal of hottie Logan. \nWhat we hope will happen: Logan had his fans, but many watchers were firmly in the camp of team Jess or team Dean, Rory's previous loves. I was with bad boy Jess. But I'm hoping she finds somebody new and worthy of her. I hope she doesn't go into politics, but uses her big brain and equally big heart are set on saving the world in some way. I'm guessing journalism was a mere stepping stone. Emily (Kelly Bishop) \nWhat happened: At Rory's goodbye party, Emily attempts to get Lorelai to accept a loan from her, thus assuring a connection to her once Rory is gone. Lorelai puts her off but says they can discuss it more at the Friday night dinner. (The tradition that started when Lorelai's rich-but-estranged parents agreed to weekly dinners in exchange for loaning Lorelai money so a young Rory could attend prep school.) \nWhat we hope will happen: We hope that although their relationship has come a long way, that Lorelai and Emily continue to take verbal jabs at each other as is their way of bonding. Emily is now a widow since her husband Richard is gone. (Actor Edward Hermann died in 2014.) It would be great to witness Emily's vulnerable underbelly because of her grief. Luke (Scott Patterson) \nWhat happened: He's still running the diner, and he kissed a grateful Lorelai after he secretly organized Rory's touching goodbye party. \nWhat we hope will happen: We hope he's still fond of wearing flannel and the backward, blue baseball cap. Don't go changin,' Luke. We love ya. Christopher (David Sutcliffe) \nWhat happened: Lorelai's ex and Rory's father had officially cut any romantic ties with Lorelai and attended Rory's graduation. \nWhat we hope will happen: We hope he finds someone. Not someone who will run off to Paris, as has happened, but someone who wants him for more than his money. Dean (Jared Padalecki) \nWhat happened: Dean was Rory's first love until Jess came along. They rekindled their romance only briefly while he was married to someone else. He found work at the Dragonfly Inn, and it was clear that he and Rory are better as friends. \nWhat we hope will happen: Meh. Why are good guys, except for cheating on his wife I guess, always the most boring? Jess (Milo Ventimiglia) \nWhat happened: Jess, a lover of books and leather jackets, didn't make with Rory it as a couple. But the angry young man channeled his heavy emotions into writing a book and found his way into publishing. \nWhat we hope will happen: Jess returns to Stars Hollow and into Rory's life in some way. Stay golden! \nThe gang's all here. Tune in to find out what happens in Stars Hollow on Nov. 25 on Netflix. (Photo: Saeed Adyani, Netflix) Logan (Matt Czuchry) \nWhat happened : Rory rejected his proposal. Ouch. The charming and rich party dude headed to California for a new job. \nWhat we hope will happen: Here's hoping Logan returns with more depth. Some of us sensed it was in him. Sookie (Melissa McCarthy) \nWhat happened: Lorelai and Sookie’s dream, the Dragonfly Inn, was booking famous guests and entertaining offers to sell from a hotel chain. Sookie was pregnant again after already having two kids with husband Jackson. But he was aiming for \"four in four\" — four kids in four years. \nWhat we hope will happen: Who cares? Just more screentime for accident-prone Sookie! Lane Kim (Keiko Agena) \nWhat happened: Rory's best friend married bandmate Zach and they have twins, Steven and Kwan. She remained in Stars Hollow with her family. She gave Zach a shove out of Stars Hollow to tour with a band. \nWhat we hope will happen: As one of the coolest people on the show, and that's saying a lot, we hope that Lane revives her rock career. Maybe she could trade places with Zach, who could stay home and watch the twins? What I learned re-watching ‘Gilmore Girls’ as an adult Paris (Liza Weil) \nWhat happened: One of Rory's other best friends who was unlikable at first for her driven, jealous nature, also graduated from Yale. She got punched by the world a few times, which made her much more of a softie. She planned to go to Harvard Medical School and become a doctor. Paris and Doyle stayed together, because who else could tolerate their oddball ways? \nWhat we hope will happen: Paris and Doyle will still be together. And she's trying to manage their children in the same methodical, controlled way she did her life, which isn't working out. It could happen. \nReach the reporter at .

      "text": "Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. In addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann’s hip-hop saga “The Get Down” and the ’80s-era phenomenon that is “Stranger Things,” the streaming network has revamped animated kids’ favorites such as “Popples” and “Voltron” and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel “The Little Prince.” “Beat Bugs,” another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show “Gilmore Girls,” on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn’t the first to evoke bygone eras – Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as “All That” and “Clarissa Explains It All” in 2011. But that was before the days of “peak TV” and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix’s early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia’s reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network’s ambitious plans for original content.\n“We’re looking, always, for the great stories,” said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. “We’re not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.”\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n“Stranger Things” wasn’t a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late ’70s and ’80s, including Ridley Scott’s “Alien,” Rob Reiner’s 1986 film “Stand By Me” and ’80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including “E.T.” Similarly, “The Get Down” added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\n“Stranger Things” was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network “definitely knew we had something special” after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\nSarandos said “Stranger Things” is popular on a global scale, although that’s difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn’t share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers “with incredible granularity,” but it doesn’t consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn’t sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that “Stranger Things” and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show’s dedicated fan base. “There’s no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,” Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. “Full House” and “Gilmore Girls” both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn’t just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived “Rush Hour” reboot – “Fuller House” and the “Gilmore Girls” miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven’t succeeded, at times, with the remake format – “MacGyver” has done well on Friday night for CBS, “Lethal Weapon” has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and “The Exorcist,” which isn’t a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you’re a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in “Stranger Things” and “The Get Down.” “It’s all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,” he said, using the rotary phones in “Stranger Things” as an example.\n“My 20-year-old son never said ‘What’s that?’ because he’s so used to seeing it (on) film and television,” Sarandos said. “It’s almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.”\ntv-netflix",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?  45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?  45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information.

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?  45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now? Tuesday Nov 22, 2016 at 11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "I’ve only seen four episodes of Netflix’s new prestige series “The Crown,” which will follow the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the early days of her marriage up until the present day. It’s extraordinarily well done, with beautiful production values and solid performances all around. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that this series may go down in history as the finest anti-smoking pubic service announcement ever filmed.\nThe first episode begins with King George VI coughing up blood due to his metastasizing lung cancer. In the next shot, he’s shown happily puffing away at a cigarette, blithely ignorant of the correlation between his smoking habit and the blood in his spittle that he attributes to “the cold weather.” Not long after, young Prince Philip is seen lighting up, too, which prompts this exchange with his soon-to-be-wife Elizabeth.\n“Must you really smoke?” she asks. “You know how I hate it.”\n“Pity,” he answers. “Because I love it so very much. But like a great many other things, I’m going to give it all up for you.”\nAnd so he does, making Elizabeth and Philip unique among the royals. The king continues to indulge his habit, even after he has an entire lung removed. He coughs and sputters his way through all of his scenes until (spoiler alert) he passes away at the age of 56 near the beginning of the second episode. In contrast, the real-life Elizabeth and Philip are still with us today at the ripe old ages of 90 and 95, respectively. Surely that early decision to “give it all up” is the reason this current monarch has enjoyed such longevity, a point that is inescapable while watching this show.\nIn all the films and TV shows that were popular when Queen Elizabeth took the throne, smoking was depicted as glamorous and sophisticated. For me, that makes many of those old movies rather hard to watch. It was just a few years ago that I finally saw “Casablanca” for the first time, and while that classic has a reputation for being a magnificent romance for the ages, the only thing I could think about was how bad everyone must have smelled. Even in all the love scenes, Humphrey Bogart is smoking like a chimney, and you wonder how Ingrid Bergman can kiss him without gagging. Some clever YouTuber decided to make a video called “ Casablanca: Non-Smoking Version .” The video is 35 seconds long.\nThis is one area, then, where pop culture has changed for the better. Consider that in 2002, only 35 percent of movies with a G, PG or PG-13 rating were smoke-free. As of 2015, that number is 62 percent, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe CDC has found that there is a direct correlation between smoking on screen and young people choosing to take up the habit, and they estimate that if the MPAA were to assign an R rating to all movies that feature smoking, it would “reduce the number of teen smokers by nearly 1 in 5 (18 percent) and prevent 1 million deaths from smoking among children alive today.”\nThat would be a good thing, even though it would brand “The Crown” with an R rating, too. I still think it makes for a good PSA, though. I can’t imagine any teenager watching King George coughing and hacking himself to death coming away with a positive image of smoking, even though \"The Crown: Non-Smoking Version\" might not be much longer than 35 seconds.\nJim Bennett is a recovering actor, theater producer and politico, and he writes about pop culture and politics at his blog, stallioncornell.com .",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content.

According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels.

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now? Netflix nostalgia Netflix Nostalgia, four ways. Clockwise from top left: The youngsters of \"Stranger Things\" (Netflix); the Beatles-singing \"Beat Bugs\" (Netflix); Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (Saeed Adyani, Netflix); and a scene from \"Voltron: Legendary Defender\" (Netflix). Nostalgia, four ways. Clockwise from top left: The youngsters of \"Stranger Things\" (Netflix); the Beatles-singing \"Beat Bugs\" (Netflix); Rory and Lorelei Gilmore in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" (Saeed Adyani, Netflix); and a scene from \"Voltron: Legendary Defender\" (Netflix). (Netflix) Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\"\"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg , including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\"\"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" \nRELATED STORIES:",

According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "In Movies & TV \"Captain America: Civil War\" and \"The Angry Birds Movie\" are headed to a small screen near you next month. What's coming and going from Netflix in December \nMore articles by Matt Mueller Published Nov. 22, 2016 at 1:16 p.m. Tweet \nThere is nothing like the holidays in Milwaukee. VISIT Milwaukee is here to share your top shopping destinations, must-see holiday shows, where to meet Kris Kringle and local gifts you can't resist. Tune in all month long and 'tis the season! \nIt's not even December yet, but this week, Netflix spoiled its big Christmas gift to the movie-watching nation ... not that anybody's complaining too much. \nIn their usual monthly preview of what's coming and going, Netflix announced that, on Christmas Day, the streaming site will have the biggest movie of the year, \"Captain America: Civil War,\" available for streaming. That means those that haven't seen the blockbuster will have it happily waiting for them Christmas morning – without even needing to leave Netflix any cookies or milk – and the other 95% of the population that saw it in theaters can relive the excitement of seeing the best version of Spiderman to grace movie screens so far. \nAs for the rest of Netflix's December debuts, save for \"The Angry Birds Movie\" (gags), there's not much in terms of big new theatrical releases hitting the streaming service. There are, however, a few great comedy classics, like \"Animal House\" and \"Beverly Hills Cop,\" and as usual, there's a lot to be potentially excited about amongst the original offerings. The service will premiere a bonkers-looking comedy special from crazy-talented musical comedian Reggie Watts; \"White Rabbit Project,\" a new science show from former \"Mythbusters\" cast members Grant, Tory and Kari called \"White Rabbit Project\"; \"Trollhunters,\" a new animated TV show from the wildly imaginative Guillermo del Toro; and \"Barry,\" a biopic about young Barack Obama. \nOh, and a second season of \"Fuller House.\" Suppose you gotta take the Christmas coal with the Christmas gifts. \nHere's the rest of everything coming and going from Netflix next month: Coming to Netflix",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": " Google+\nCurtis Baker/Netflix\nWinona Ryder in Netflix’s “Stranger Things.”\nBy Matthew Gilbert Globe Staff November 22, 2016\n“Stranger Things” was a summer obsession, or a summer distraction from the presidential race, or a summer opportunity for Winona Ryder to overact up a storm, or a summer exercise in frustration as an entertaining series devolved into pointless supernatural silliness with no metaphorical weight.\nWhatever it was, it was a hit for Netflix, which is bringing the show back for a second round. Here’s what we know about the new episodes.\nAdvertisement\n1. The core of the cast will be back, including Millie Bobby Brown, whose Eleven was thought to be gone for good after tangling with the Demogorgon. Perhaps she’s in the woods, eating those Eggo waffles left by David Harbour’s Chief Hopper?\n2. Show creators the Duffer Brothers have let a few details about season two leak out. The action will remain in the 1980s, and we’ll learn more about the Upside Down: “We kinda just peeled back the curtain and revealed a tiny bit of the Upside Down,” Matt Duffer told Entertainment Weekly. “So we definitely want to explore a little bit more.”\nGet The Weekender in your inbox: The Globe's top picks for what to see and do each weekend, in Boston and beyond.

His 1980s cred includes a role in “The Goonies.”\n4. The first season had eight episodes. Season two will have nine.\n5. Paul Reiser will play a Department of Energy dude named Dr. Owens whose job involves “containing” the events of season one, when the Demogorgon kidnapped Will. His 1980s cred? TV’s “My Two Dads,” “Diner,” “Aliens,” and the “Beverly Hills Cop” movies.\nAdvertisement\n6. Brett Gelman, who pops up in all kinds of cool places including Amazon’s “Fleabag” and HBO’s “High Maintenance,” and who will be in next year’s “Twin Peaks” revival, has also signed on. He’ll play a disgraced journalist-turned-conspiracy theorist.\n7. The season is in production now, and my bet is that Netflix will once again release it in time for summer.\n8. Barb won’t be back. But Matt Duffer promised to deal with her death in an interview with IGN: “Barb will not be forgotten. We’ll make sure there’s some justice for Barb.”\nMatthew Gilbert can be reached at gilbert@globe.com . Follow him on Twitter @MatthewGilbert .",

      "text": "Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival: Will it bring you joy? Updated: November 22, 2016 — 3:01 AM EST Share TELEVISION CRITIC \nI should have known Amy Sherman-Palladino would have something to say about Marie Kondo. \nBecause the Gilmore Girls creator, who never met a scene into which she couldn't squeeze just one more idea, cultural reference, or sight gag, was unlikely to be an acolyte of the decluttering Kondo, author of the best-selling The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up . \nOn Friday, with the release on Netflix of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , you can see how Kondo, Uber, and other post-2007 phenomena figure in a world in which mother-daughter vaudeville team Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory Gilmore (Alexis Bledel) are free again to trade witticisms for four 90-minute episodes. \nPrepare, though, to be at least a little disappointed. \nKondo might advise letting go of things that don't bring you joy, but I'd argue it's sometimes best to let go of the things that do bring joy, if only so they may continue to. \nBecause of Netflix, we can have more Arrested Developmen t, more Full House -- the second season of Fuller House premieres Dec. 9 -- and now more Lorelai and Rory, but haven't we all seen enough zombie shows to know it's better to let some things rest? \nBesides, the only thing harder than returning to a beloved place to find everything changed is arriving to find not nearly enough has. \n\nThe problem isn't the frozen-in-time Stars Hollow. The fictional Connecticut town where Lorelai raised Rory always existed in its own dimension. It's a wonder it can be reached by car and not some New England version of the Hogwarts Express. \nIf all that's been missing from your TV life since Gilmore Girl s left the air were get-rich-quick schemes from Kirk (Sean Gunn) and absurdist town meetings chaired by Taylor (Michael Winters), prepare to be overjoyed, even overserved. \nFor me, it's the main characters who matter, and though they've aged, however imperceptibly, they haven't grown as much as I'd hoped in the years since Lorelai was reunited with Luke (Haddonfield's Scott Patterson) and since Rory, newly sprung from Yale, went off to cover the presidential campaign of some guy named Barack Obama. \nIn fairness to Sherman-Palladino, who shared writing and directing duties on A Year in the Life with with her husband, Daniel Palladino, the 2007 finale that set up those happily-ever-after scenarios wasn't hers. The couple had left the show before its seventh season, on the then-new CW network. \nShe was, however, responsible for the Money Is No Object fantasy of the entire series, and that continues, disappointingly, in its Netflix afterlife. \nWithout giving away any of the several plot points Netflix is hoping will surprise viewers, I can say that over four TV-movie-length episodes, the story wanders into more than one expensive cul-de-sac and that far more attention seems to have been paid to finding something for a legion of returning actors to do than in forming a coherent narrative. \nThe format -- the equivalent of eight TV episodes in four seasonal chunks -- doesn't serve the material very well and makes bingeing less tempting than usual. \nOn the plus side: There are some fun developments on the minor-character front (and a few surprising cameos); Kelly Bishop's Emily Gilmore gets to wear jeans; and the late Edward Herrmann , who played Lorelai's father and Emily's husband, gets a richly deserved send-off. \nIf only I could say the same for the show itself.

      "text": "Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content.\n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\"\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg , including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example.\n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"\nRELATED STORIES: \n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring \nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy \n'Stranger Things' pulls Ravenswood actor into its orbit \nWinona Ryder is great in 'Stranger Things,' but don't ask if this is her big comeback \nEarth tones, rotary phones and Winona Ryder: Netflix's 'Stranger Things' is totally '80s \n \nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\n \nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n  Steven Spielberg",

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

The ability to watch live sports is the only thing keeping many people tied to their cable company, but Amazon may be looking to change that.\nCredit: Shutterstock \nAccording to a report from The Wall Street Journal , the mega-retailer is looking into a premium streaming sports package and has met with the NBA, NFL, MLB and Major League Soccer.\nReportedly, Amazon has brought up options about streaming sports as part of Amazon Prime or a separate \"skinny bundle\" of channels, though the details aren't clear at this time. Completing those deals would be extremely difficult, as the sports leagues have multiple-year deals with cable channels, some of which last up to a decade. \nMORE: What Is Amazon Prime? \nThe Journal also reports that Amazon has met with smaller leagues, including the World Surf Lead, the collegiate Atlantic Coastal Conference (which includes teams from the University of North Carolina, Duke, Syracuse University and Virginia Tech, among others) and may also be exploring cricket and lacrosse.\nThe deal wouldn't be unprecedented. Twitter has a deal with the NFL to stream Thursday night football games. But for a slate of continuously streaming major sports, Amazon is likely playing a long waiting game.\nSee Also : 20 Best Amazon Alexa Skills \nBest Streaming Devices: Chromecast, Roku, Apple TV & More What Is Amazon Student? 15 Best Sports Apps About the author Andrew E.

      "text": "Black Mirror is back! The popular show’s third season has been picked up by Netflix and the internet is buzzing. In case you’ve never seen the show, it imagines a series of futuristic worlds in which technology similar to what we have today is (usually) ruining everyone’s lives. The episodes stand alone with only the very loose theme of technology to connect them.\nThe show can basically be summed up as “it would be bad if...” Like, it would be bad if virtual reality took over our minds. Or, it would be bad if social media dictated our actual social standing. Or, it would be bad if your dead boyfriend came back as an android.\nBut there’s one episode in the latest season of Black Mirror that has everyone feeling a bit more optimistic. Everyone, it seems, except me. And yes—full disclosure—I am a bit of a pessimist, but I don’t think that’s the problem here. I think it’s actually a problem of world-view: it’s only optimistic if you don’t believe in heaven.\nI’m talking about episode four, \"San Junipero\" ( and there will be major spoilers, so don’t read on if you haven’t seen it and want to ).\nThe episode takes place, as most Black Mirror episodes do, sometime in the not-so-distant future where people are given a say about what happens to them after they die. There are two choices. Either they can choose to have their consciousness downloaded into a virtual reality world called San Junipero (a process called “passing over”), or they can choose to simply die, at which point no one knows what happens to them. Perhaps they go to heaven. But perhaps there is nothing at all.\nOur main characters, two women named Yorkie and Kelly, are still alive in real life but are visiting San Junipero for a trial period. Although they are old women in real life, they are young again in San Junipero. They meet there and fall in love.\nNeither Kelly nor Yorkie believes there is a heaven. Because of this (and for other reasons revealed in the show) Yorkie has decided to stay in San Junipero after she dies. Kelly, on the other hand, has opted not to because her late husband didn't, so she won’t either. Now that Kelly and Yorkie are in love, Yorkie tries to convince Kelly to change her mind and stay with her forever in San Junipero.\nhttps://pjmedia.com/faith/2016/11/22/black-mirrors-san-junipero-is-only-optimistic-if-you-dont-believe-in-heaven/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 ",

      "title": "Ten years on, the 'Gilmore Girls' are back",
      "text": "On November 25, the noughties cult series \"Gilmore Girls\" is to make a comeback on Netflix with a new season of four 90-minute episodes.\nIn the wake of \"Arrested Development\" and \"Full House\", the American video on demand platform is set to stream the latest adventures of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, the heroines of the \"Gilmore Girls,\" a series that aired between 2000 and 2007 on the WB and subsequently CW networks.\nIf you are curious to find out what has become of Lorelai and Rory, the intensely close mother and daughter duo, over the last ten years, you will have to wait until November 25. Netflix is determined to give nothing away. Only one thing is certain, and that is that all of the key characters of the original series have decided to participate in this long-awaited comeback.\nLauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, who play the two heroines will be joined by many of the residents of Stars Hollow. Scott Patterson, the actor who plays Luke, will be back, as will be Rory's former boyfriends.\nMatt Czuchry (Logan), who starred in \"The Good Wife,\" Milo Ventimiglia (Jess), whose talents are currently on display in \"This is Us\" and Jared Padalecki (Dean), who has played in \"Supernatural,\" will be part of the show. Even Melissa McCarthy has found time in her tightly packed schedule to once again take on the role of Sookie.\nBut one character will be missing\nOnly Richard Gilmore, Lorelai's father, will be absent following the death of actor Edward Herrmann in 2014. This sad news will in fact be included in the screenplay for the first episode which is to begin at Richard Gilmore's funeral.\nThe \"Gilmore Girls\" comeback will take the form of four extra-long 90-minute episodes that recount an entire year in the lives of Lorelai and Rory. Each episode will correspond to a particular season, with episode one focusing on winter.\nThis latest salvo will likely reconcile fans with the series and finally provide them with a much longed for ending. The seventh season was unusual in as much as the first to be broadcast on the CW network, which had failed to retain the services of the series' creator, Amy Sherman-Palladino. However, Sherman-Palladino has participated in the “Gilmore Girls” comeback which will feature an ending that is more in line with what she imagined for the original show.\nThe “Gilmore Girls” trailer: https://youtu.be/kGGNNSmGDpU",

      "text": "Keeping your secrets safe on Amazon, Google, Facebook and Netflix By Kim Komando, Komando.com photo courtesy of SHUTTERSTOCK When a relationship gets serious, we start to share more of our lives. We borrow each other’s cars. We move in together. Inevitably, we start sharing each other’s technology and even our passwords. But your device says a lot about you: Your pastimes, your taste in music, your curiosities and the things you shop for. So how do you maintain your privacy online, even with the people who are closest to you? Here are a few simple tricks to help you keep your secrets under wraps. (Note: Apps and websites do not always work the same across all devices and operating systems. If something isn’t located in the menus precisely as I say, look around for a similar action.) Amazon Amazon tracks not only what you have purchased, but also what you have browsed. If you share an Amazon account, both can pose a major problem especially this time of year. The good news is that you can easily cover your tracks. To erase your browsing history, from your account settings, look for Personalization. Go to Personalized Content >> View and Manage Your Browsing History. Here, you have a few options. You can remove only certain items or all items as well as turn off browsing history so you never have this issue again. Let’s say you want to make it more difficult for someone to find out what you have ordered. Amazon will not completely delete your order history, but you can archive individual orders. Casual snoops will have a harder time seeing what you have purchased. From your account settings, go to Your Orders. Select the item you wish to hide and select Archive order. You can use the Amazon app as an additional holiday security measure. Suppose you have purchased a pair of shoes for your spouse, you’ve archived the order, and now you’re waiting for the package to arrive. But you’re receiving so many boxes this time of year, how do you know which delivery to open and wrap? With the Amazon app, you can scan the barcode on the box to immediately find out what’s inside. It works like a charm – unless your spouse has secretly ordered something for you! By the way, Amazon has added a slew of new benefits for Prime members from unlimited photo storage to free eBooks. Click here for seven Amazon Prime perks you’re probably not using. Google Google often auto-completes your search terms based on personal information, such as your location and previous searches. Anyone looking over your shoulder or borrowing your device might be surprised by the guesses Google makes. Google products that collect your information include Chrome, Google Maps and YouTube. To delete your search history on Google, you need a Google account. Just log in, go to My Activity, and remove items individually. Most browsers have a similarly easy way to delete your browsing history, and the controls tend to be in your browser’s preferences. Keep this in mind, especially if you’re researching something a little unusual. Facebook For many of us, Facebook is like a sprawling digital yearbook. Maybe you have a family computer, and you usually forget to log out of Facebook. Other people use the same computer, they stumble into your Facebook account, and they notice your conspicuous search history. Your significant other may wonder why you’ve become so curious about the person you once invited to the prom, no matter how innocent your interest. The easiest way to avoid an awkward conversation is to open your Activity Log. Select More >> Search >> Clear Searches. Or you can remove each search item one by one. Your Facebook Activity Log stores a lot of data about you. Click here for tips to clean it up and prevent things from coming back to haunt you. Netflix We all have our guilty pleasures, especially when it comes to movies. You may have privately viewed Lars Von Trier’s \"Nymphomaniac\" and thought it was a great work of art-house cinema, but that could be hard to explain to a roomful of people. If you want to hide past screenings, just go to My Account >> Viewing History. Be advised that items aren’t always deleted immediately; it may take 24 hours for your lists to update on all devices. Netflix also allows you to create multiple profiles. Many households don’t bother with this unless they have children, but if you want to keep your viewing history private, you can create a personal profile and protect it with a password. Click here to learn how to do this as well as access secret Netflix categories. Go incognito Every major web browser including Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Safari and Opera has private, or incognito, browsing settings. Turning this feature on means your browser will ignore cookies including ad-tracking cookies and won't record your browsing history. It's almost like you were never online. Click here to learn how to enable this simple step to keep your browsing history a secret. Maintaining privacy is one of my favorite themes. To learn other ways to protect your information, be sure to listen or download my podcasts, or click here to find it on your local radio station .

      "title": "Captain America: Civil War Is Coming to Netflix This Christmas",
      "text": "Ryan Scott | 26 minutes ago \nNetflix is giving subscribers a pretty super Christmas present. It looks like the biggest movie of the year, Captain America: Civil War , will be landing on the streaming platform Christmas Day, meaning after you open your presents and spend some time with the family, you can watch Cap and Iron Man duke it out from the comfort of your couch. Christmas may not be coming early, but it will be awesome. As long as you're a Netflix subscriber. \nThe list of titles hitting Netflix in December is pretty hefty, but Captain America: Civil War is by far the biggest title arriving on the streaming service next month. The bulk of the new titles will drop on December 1, which should help kill some time until Christmas. The Angry Birds Movie, another reasonably big 2016 release, will hit the streaming service at the beginning of the month, but you can also watch Beverly Hills Cop, Honey, I Shrunk the Kids and The Rock while you wait to watch that amazing airport sequence again. \nNetflix will be graced with titles like Captain America: Civil War quite frequently in the future. This is thanks to a deal the company inked with Disney some time ago that gives them exclusive rights to all of the company's new titles after they are released on DVD and Blu-Ray. So subscribers can also look forward to seeing The Jungle Book, Finding Dory and Doctor Strange on Netflix sooner rather than later. This deal even extends to Star Wars movies, so if you aren't a bonus feature junkie, you may want to wait until Rogue One: A Star Wars Story hits Netflix instant streaming next year and save yourself the $20 or so on the hard copy. \nWith this new deal finally going into effect as of September, shortly after movies hit the shelves on DVD and Blu-Ray, they will make their way to Netflix and will never make it to other streaming services as long as the deal is in place. The movies will be available exclusively to stream on Netflix for the same period of time that they would usually be shown on standard cable TV, so though the movies will eventually find their way to more traditional outlets, it will be an even longer wait than usual. The landmark deal didn't come cheap though, as Netflix is reportedly paying hundreds of millions of dollars per year for the rights to all of Disney 's theatrical releases from 2016 and beyond. \nCivil War is, as of right now, the highest grossing movie of 2016 at the box office. The movie made a very impressive $1.15 billion at the global box office, dwarfing the grosses of the previous two Captain America outings. That was largely thanks to the fact that the movie was received very well by critics, and because Spider-Man got to make his onscreen debut as part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe in the movie. Be on the lookout on December 25, because that is when you'll be able to stream Captain America: Civil War on Netflix.",

      "text": "Hey everybody Dave Bartosiak with Trending Stocks at Zacks.com. Make no mistake about it, content is King. It’s how HBO became a powerhouse. It’s what transformed Netflix ( NFLX - Free Report ) into a household name. And it’s what makes me and the guys back worth our weight in gold. #BeardGameStrong.  \nThe mad land grab for talent used to be restricted to the cable networks just like ugly guys with nice voices were trapped in radio before Sirius XM ( SIRI - Free Report ) made Howard Stern into a bazillionaire. Now every streaming service in the world is bidding for content. \nMy favorite car show ever, Top Gear, was cancelled after the host punched a producer. But Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) rushed in to offer the team a contract to put their show on Amazon Prime. The Grand Tour debuted last week and frankly, it was awesome. \nNow Netflix announced the funniest man of my generation is coming back to do three specials. Dave Chappelle just landed a deal worth $60 million. That’s $10 million more than Comedy Central offered him for season 3 of the Chappelle Show. Netflix already has a huge deal in place with Disney ( DIS - Free Report ) it struck back in 2012 and has been producing great original content like “Narcos” and “House of Cards” for years. If you’re looking to learn a little financial literacy and laugh at the stock market, hey, Netflix, #WhatAboutDave. The bidding starts at $10 million. Cash. \nHow can you profit from the growth of streaming TV? You could check out the companies that are bundling streaming services together like Dish Network’s ( DISH - Free Report ) Sling TV. But frankly, I don’t feel like there is any barrier to entry there other than your ability to negotiate a contract. So maybe the best way to play this is to load up on Netflix and hope they reach international audiences before Amazon does. Amazon is at a better price point at $90 a year and includes a subscription to Prime. \nAs for our take, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. That means that analysts that follow the stock keep increasing the amount of money they think Netflix is going to make this year and next year. In fact, 13 analysts have pushed up their earnings estimates for the current year. The average of their estimates or our Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone from 31 cents to 41 cents for this year. Next year’s average has gone from 96 cents to $1.02. \nEvery time you share this video, I get one step closer to the What About Dave Netflix special. Chime in the comments section below, let me know if you subscribe to Netflix or you’re just stealing your ex’s log-in info. Subscribe to the YouTube channel , Twitter @bartosiastics , and come back here for all the Trending Stocks with Zacks.com, I’m Dave Bartosiak.",

Toby Stephens (“Black Sails”) will play husband John, Taylor Russell (“Falling Skies”) daughter Judy and Max Jenkins (“Sense8,”“Popstar”) son Will. Still uncast is younger daughter Penny Robinson. \nMatt Sazama and Burk Sharpless are the writers behind the Netflix reboot of CBS’ 1960s space opera, which followed a family of scientists who couldn’t quite figure out how to get to Alpha Centauri. \nSazama and Sharpless’ big-screen writing credits include “Dracula Untold” (which garnered positive reviews from 22% of critics polled by the Rotten Tomatoes website), “The Last Witch Hunter” (15%) and “Gods of Egypt” (16%).",

      "text": "Programming Up TV Would ‘Love’ to Grab Netflix’s New ‘Gilmore Girls’ Cable net in midst of ‘Gilmore the Merrier’ stunt involving all 153 original episodes 11/22/2016 04:30:00 PM Eastern Follow @bcmikemalone \nCable network Up TV is in the midst of a Gilmore Girls marathon, airing all 153 episodes over the course of a week in advance of the show’s ballyhooed revival on Netflix. Positive findings from the stunt, which kicked off Nov. 18, sees Up eager to up its stake in the show. \nNetflix will stream four 90-minute “chapters” of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life starting Nov. 25. Up, which has a triple run of the original Gilmore Girls on its weekday schedule (5, 6, 7 p.m.), would be keen to acquire the new episodes. “We would certainly love to have them,” says Amy Winter, executive VP and general manager at Up. “Time will tell how Netflix and Warner Bros. utilize them, but we would definitely like to add them to the mix.” \nThe network drew 3.1 million total viewers to its “Gilmore the Merrier” stunt this past weekend, comparable to what it might see for a Christmas movie premiere. Up also saw a median age of 40 over the weekend; it’s usually around 47-48. Gilmore cast member Sean Gunn hosts the marathon; Up has been supplementing the episodes with watch-and-win contests and interstitials. \n“It’s been a steady build as it goes,” says Winter, who adds that Up’s family focus makes Gilmore Girls a good fit. \nGilmore Girls aired for seven seasons, from 2000 to 2007 and starred Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel and Melissa McCarthy. The series was created by Amy Sherman-Palladino, who was an executive producer with Gavin Polone and Daniel Palladino. The series was produced by Dorothy Parker Drank Here Productions and Hofflund/Polone in association with Warner Bros. Television. \nUp, the former GMC TV, is available in close to 70 million homes. Earlier this year, it acquired all 103 episodes of Parenthood from NBCUniversal Television and New Media Distribution. \nWhile it starts rolling the Christmas movies just after Halloween, Up will re-air season one of Gilmore Girls Nov. 28, envisioning a hungry new audience that found the show on Netflix over the Thanksgiving break.

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 \n\nHey everybody Dave Bartosiak with Trending Stocks at Zacks.com. Make no mistake about it, content is King. It’s how HBO became a powerhouse. It’s what transformed Netflix ( NFLX - Free Report ) into a household name. And it’s what makes me and the guys back worth our weight in gold. #BeardGameStrong. \nThe mad land grab for talent used to be restricted to the cable networks just like ugly guys with nice voices were trapped in radio before Sirius XM ( SIRI - Free Report ) made Howard Stern into a bazillionaire. Now every streaming service in the world is bidding for content. \nMy favorite car show ever, Top Gear, was cancelled after the host punched a producer. But Amazon ( AMZN - Free Report ) rushed in to offer the team a contract to put their show on Amazon Prime. The Grand Tour debuted last week and frankly, it was awesome. \nNow Netflix announced the funniest man of my generation is coming back to do three specials. Dave Chappelle just landed a deal worth $60 million. That’s $10 million more than Comedy Central offered him for season 3 of the Chappelle Show. Netflix already has a huge deal in place with Disney ( DIS - Free Report ) it struck back in 2012 and has been producing great original content like “Narcos” and “House of Cards” for years. If you’re looking to learn a little financial literacy and laugh at the stock market, hey, Netflix, #WhatAboutDave. The bidding starts at $10 million. Cash. \nHow can you profit from the growth of streaming TV? You could check out the companies that are bundling streaming services together like Dish Network’s ( DISH - Free Report ) Sling TV. But frankly, I don’t feel like there is any barrier to entry there other than your ability to negotiate a contract. So maybe the best way to play this is to load up on Netflix and hope they reach international audiences before Amazon does. Amazon is at a better price point at $90 a year and includes a subscription to Prime. \nAs for our take, Netflix is a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) right now. That means that analysts that follow the stock keep increasing the amount of money they think Netflix is going to make this year and next year. In fact, 13 analysts have pushed up their earnings estimates for the current year. The average of their estimates or our Zacks Consensus Estimate has gone from 31 cents to 41 cents for this year. Next year’s average has gone from 96 cents to $1.02. \nEvery time you share this video, I get one step closer to the What About Dave Netflix special. Chime in the comments section below, let me know if you subscribe to Netflix or you’re just stealing your ex’s log-in info.

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now?   11:45 AM Bethonie Butler - The Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras - Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot - \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\" Author Information: Bethonie Butler writes about television for The Post. @bethoniebutler",

      "text": "I’ve only seen four episodes of Netflix’s new prestige series “The Crown,” which will follow the life of Queen Elizabeth II from the early days of her marriage up until the present day. It’s extraordinarily well done, with beautiful production values and solid performances all around. Yet I can’t shake the feeling that this series may go down in history as the finest anti-smoking public service announcement ever filmed.\nThe first episode begins with King George VI coughing up blood due to his metastasizing lung cancer. In the next shot, he’s shown happily puffing away at a cigarette, blithely ignorant of the correlation between his smoking habit and the blood in his spittle that he attributes to “the cold weather.” Not long after, young Prince Philip is seen lighting up, too, which prompts this exchange with his soon-to-be-wife Elizabeth.\n“Must you really smoke?” she asks. “You know how I hate it.”\n“Pity,” he answers. “Because I love it so very much. But like a great many other things, I’m going to give it all up for you.”\nAnd so he does, making Elizabeth and Philip unique among the royals. The king continues to indulge his habit, even after he has an entire lung removed. He coughs and sputters his way through all of his scenes until (spoiler alert) he passes away at the age of 56 near the beginning of the second episode. In contrast, the real-life Elizabeth and Philip are still with us today at the ripe old ages of 90 and 95, respectively. Surely that early decision to “give it all up” is the reason this current monarch has enjoyed such longevity, a point that is inescapable while watching this show.\nIn all the films and TV shows that were popular when Queen Elizabeth took the throne, smoking was depicted as glamorous and sophisticated. For me, that makes many of those old movies rather hard to watch. It was just a few years ago that I finally saw “Casablanca” for the first time, and while that classic has a reputation for being a magnificent romance for the ages, the only thing I could think about was how bad everyone must have smelled. Even in all the love scenes, Humphrey Bogart is smoking like a chimney, and you wonder how Ingrid Bergman can kiss him without gagging. Some clever YouTuber decided to make a video called “ Casablanca: Non-Smoking Version .” The video is 35 seconds long.\nThis is one area, then, where pop culture has changed for the better. Consider that in 2002, only 35 percent of movies with a G, PG or PG-13 rating were smoke-free. As of 2015, that number is 62 percent, according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\nThe CDC has found that there is a direct correlation between smoking on screen and young people choosing to take up the habit, and they estimate that if the MPAA were to assign an R rating to all movies that feature smoking, it would “reduce the number of teen smokers by nearly 1 in 5 (18 percent) and prevent 1 million deaths from smoking among children alive today.”\nThat would be a good thing, even though it would brand “The Crown” with an R rating, too. I still think it makes for a good PSA, though. I can’t imagine any teenager watching King George coughing and hacking himself to death coming away with a positive image of smoking, even though \"The Crown: Non-Smoking Version\" might not be much longer than 35 seconds.\nJim Bennett is a recovering actor, theater producer and politico, and he writes about pop culture and politics at his blog, stallioncornell.com .",

      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life Next Up The Walking Dead : What's Next for Daryl? \nYou hoped and you prayed and you maybe even made a deal with a shady guy who claimed to the Devil but was actually just a random unwashed hoodlum hanging outside Gypsy's garage. But none of that matters now. Even without obvious divine intervention, we're still getting another chapter in the lives of the fast-talking, pop culture-loving Gilmore Girls . All we had to do was wait for our Netflix overlords to make a deal with series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband, executive producer Daniel Palladino , to grant our deepest desires. \nThe result is a four-episode trip back to the wacky world of Stars Hollow, where time has passed but seemingly nothing has changed except Luke has gotten even more annoying about his strict diner rules (no pictures of food!). Although the revival, which covers a year in the lives of the Gilmores, isn't with its faults, it feels so good to be back in this dream-like small town existence that it's easy to overlook them. \nHere's what to expect when the four 90-minutes episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life debut on the streaming service Friday, Nov. 25. \nWhere we pick up: When the series returns, 10 years will have passed since Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) left Stars Hollow in the show's Season 7 (formerly series) finale and four months will have gone by since the death of Gilmore family patriarch Richard ( Edward Herrmann passed away in December 2014). According to Sherman-Palladino, who spoke with reporters at the Television Critics Association summer press tour earlier this year, the show will focus on \"how that's going to project them all into different life streams.\" \nWhen we next see her, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) will still be working at the inn and living in Stars Hollow with Luke, having settled into a life of (presumably) happy domesticity. Meanwhile Rory, who has been criss-crossing the globe while pursuing her journalism career, will find herself at a crossroads, unsure of where she's going next. And Kelly Bishop 's usually strong-willed Emily is cracking under the pressure of trying to figure out what her life looks like in the wake of losing her partner of 50 years. She's wearing jeans, people. JEANS! \nElsewhere, Luke ( Scott Patterson ) is still grumpy, Stars Hollow is still filled with crazy people, everyone still talks a lot and Paris Geller ( Liza Weil ) is still a national treasure. \nGilmore Girls : 17 things we need to see in the revival Scott Patterson, Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nIt's not just about the final four words: As any true Gilmore Girls fan knows, before Team Palladino departed the original series amid contract disputes following Season 6, Sherman-Palladino had planned the final four words to be spoken in the series finale. However, once they left and David S. Rosenthal took over for Season 7, all hope of learning those words quickly evaporated. Until now. Will they live up to expectations? Maybe! Maybe not. It depends on how hard you've been thinking about them over the years. But Sherman-Palladino warns against skipping to the end just to hear those almost mythological-level words. \n\"It would be great if people who wanted to see the last four words first got some therapy before it actually aired and got rid of that inclination,\" she says. \"Because it really is a journey leading up to the last four words. And I do think that it's going to mean a lot more if you've taken the journey, and it's going to mean a lot less if you just flip to the last page. That being said, what can I do? So I would hope that people would want to take the whole trip. It's a fun trip. It's worth it.\" \nRory and Lorelai have a new dynamic: Despite being best friends, Rory and Lorelai's relationship during the duration of the original series was still very much that of a mother and a daughter, even when the former was in college. When the series returns that will have changed now that they're both more or less functioning adults. \"It was fun to play with Rory and Lorelai, who we always saw as best friends first and mother and daughter second. It's always how we broke stories [in the original series],\" says Sherman-Palladino. \"[In A Year in the Life ] we broke girlfriend stories, not mother-daughter stories. It was interesting to actually now play them as girlfriends -- girlfriends who travel and talk on the phone and keep in touch the way I do with my friends. It's just that they happen to be mother and daughter. It was more interesting. I think Alexis thought it was more fun playing Rory as a grown up human being with the problems that come with being a grown up human being.\" \nGilmore Girls Review: Why these four episodes won't be enough for fans \nAnd then there's the ongoing saga of Rory's love life: Arguing about which of Rory's three serious boyfriends -- Dean ( Jared Padalecki ), Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ) or Logan ( Matt Czuchry ) -- was best suited for her has become one of the show's lasting legacies, right up there with coffee addiction and a very real, gripping desire to move to New England. Despite continued insistence from Sherman-Palladino that Rory's story is about her and not the admittedly very attractive men in her life (preach!), all three men appear in the revival. Bledel promises that there will be some kind of resolution and everyone's questions will be answered by the end of the revival's fourth and final episode. Hopefully this means we'll soon all be able to go back to arguing about what really matters, which is whether Paris is the best or the greatest person in human existence. \nMelissa McCarthy is back and it's great: After the very public back and forth about whether or not the uber successful Melissa McCarthy would reprise her role as Sookie St. James, Lorelai's best friend and business partner, fans will be happy to know the Palladinos squeezed as much out of the movie star's short time on set as possible. \"We got her for one day, but we utilized that day. Oh, we worked her,\" says Sherman-Palladino of Sookie's \"big scene\" in the revival (of which you can see a tease in the full series trailer released last month). \n\"It was like three days for anyone else,\" adds Palladino. \"She left exhausted, but it was great. She brought her classic game. It was really fun working with her.\" Todd Lowe and Keigo Agena, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nOh yeah, there's a parade of familiar faces: Although McCarthy's star shot through the roof in the years since the show went off the air, she was but one actor who returned to reprise their role in the revival. By now you're probably intimately familiar with the list of everyone who returned, but if you're not, here's a quick run down of the most obvious returnees: Keiko Agena as Lane, Sean Gunn as Kirk, Yanic Truesdale as Michel, Michael Winters as Taylor, Sally Struthers as Babette, Liz Torres as Miss Patty, Rose Abdoo as Gypsy, Todd Lowe as Zack, John Cabrera as Brian, Sebastian Bach as Gil, Emily Kuroda as Mrs. Kim, Danny Strong as Doyle, Vanessa Marano as April and David Sutcliff as Christopher. \nAccording to the Palladinos, it wasn't just about bringing people back for the sake of bringing them back, it was about bringing them back organically. \"We couldn't bring everyone back because it wasn't just a nostalgia trip. We didn't just want people coming in and waving,\" says Palladino. However, if given the chance to produce more episodes -- which they say they have not discussed at all yet -- they would love to bring other people back. You know what that means: It's time to start your petitions to Netflix so we can find out what the hell Adam Brody's Dave Rygalski is up to, folks. \nGilmore Girls : What's the same? What's different? \nIt's also a Bunheads reunion: Although Bunheads , Sherman-Palladino's dance-centered series starring Bishop and Sutton Foster , only made it one season before cancellation, some of the cast has been put to work in the revival. In addition to Tony Award-winner Foster, who shows off her impressive skills in a musical within the show, Stacey Oristano , Bailey De Young , and Julia Goldani Telles also appear. \nDealing with unfinished business: For many of the folks involved in the show, the Season 7 finale didn't feel like a proper ending. And that's because it wasn't one. \"We didn't know it was the end,\" says Graham. \"Our director just mimicked the shot from the pilot. She was like, 'I've got to give people something if it's going to be the end.' We were all up in the air and so that, I think, is why we're sitting here to some degree. ... It's not like a grab for attention. It was just really we didn't get to end the show. ... So yes, it felt like unfinished business and now I think it feels resolved... ish.\" \nResolved... ish? We'll take it! \nAll four 90-minute episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premiere Friday, Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "title": "'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life': 7 Things You Need to Know",
      "text": "At long last, the premiere of Netflix 's \" Gilmore Girls \" revival series, \" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ,\" is finally upon us, and with it, the return of our beloved Lorelai, Rory, Emily, Luke, Sookie, Paris, and the rest of the town of Stars Hollow . \nThe four-part series -- divided into season-specific episodes titled \"Winter,\" \"Spring,\" \"Summer,\" and \"Fall\" -- picks up about nine years after the Season 7 finale, and finds our characters in markedly different stages of their lives, a little older but not necessarily much wiser, and still striving to figure themselves out. \nThe season theme indicates there will be plenty of change, and we can't wait to see what \"Gilmore Girls\" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino has in store for our titular girls. Read on for the key things to watch out for when \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" debuts on November 25. \n1. Lorelai and Luke are still together -- but in a rut \nThe first full-length trailer for \"Gilmore: Girls: A Year in the Life\" was a bit ominous about Luke and Lorelai's relationship, with Lorelai trying to convince herself out loud that she and Luke -- who still haven't gotten married -- are truly happy. Lorelai also admits that she feels a bit lost, and doesn't really know what she wants out of life. Does this mean that she and Luke are on the verge of a(nother) breakup? From the promotional photos to the short clips we've seen so far, they certainly look like a content, comfortable couple. Only time will tell if they remain that way for the rest of the revival -- and whether or not that's a good thing. \n2. Rory's journalism career isn't going well \nRory's dream of being a professional journalist seemed to be off to a great start when Season 7 ended, with the former Yale Daily News editor landing a job covering Barack Obama's presidential campaign straight out of college. But whatever success that that brought her appears to have been short-lived, with the official Netflix synopsis for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" noting that she's living in New York, but her career has stalled. In the trailer, she tries to put a positive spin on her rootless existence, but seems more than a little wistful about what could have been, lamenting to Jess, \"I could have been a contender.\" Early promo photos show that she winds up back at Chilton, but what she's doing there is so far unclear (is she just visiting as an alumna, or is she a teacher now?). \n3. Emily is rebuilding her life after Richard's death \nThe death of Richard Gilmore was written into the show to reflect the real-life passing of actor Edward Herrmann, who died in 2014 . The storyline is bound to be an emotional one, and it hits every Gilmore woman hard, but particularly Emily, whose entire life revolved around her husband. After Richard's previous health scares during the original series' run, she confided to Lorelai that she didn't know who she was if she wasn't Richard Gilmore's wife. Now, she has to figure that out. The trailer makes light of this to a certain extent, depicting Emily decluttering her life (while wearing jeans -- a truly revolutionary fashion choice for a woman who typically wouldn't be caught dead in anything other than Chanel), though there are some more somber moments, too, that reflect her overwhelming grief. Expect that dichotomy to play a major role in her journey. \n4. All of Rory's boyfriends are back \nRory's three old boyfriends -- Dean ( Jared Padalecki ), Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ), and Logan ( Matt Czuchry ) -- will all appear in at least one episode each of the revival, though it seems fair to say that they won't all play equal roles. Who, if anyone, will Rory wind up with? Based on what we've seen so far, all signs currently point to Jess, the only former paramour who has dialogue in the trailer, has appeared in a separate teaser , and has been featured in a promotional photo . That could be deliberate misdirection, though, and with lots of new characters in the mix, Rory could end up someone completely different -- or even, perhaps most fittingly, no one at all. \n5. Stars Hollow is as quirky as ever \nJust about every resident of Stars Hollow will be returning for the revival, including Lane (still rocking out as a drummer), Taylor (still leading ridiculous town meetings), Kirk (as weird as ever, and attending Friday night dinner for some reason), Miss Patty and Babette (who are spearheading a musical about the town), and Michel (just as snarky and withering as you remember). Expect many, many more familiar faces in addition to those, and all the small town shenanigans that go with them. \n6. Sookie is back! \nAfter a lot of back and forth between actress Melissa McCarthy and \"Gilmore Girls\" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, the pair finally worked out a deal for McCarthy to reprise her role as Lorelai's BFF and co-owner of the Dragonfly. Because of McCarthy's insanely busy schedule, it will only be a small cameo, but still, a little Sookie is better than no Sookie at all. And it should come as no surprise that the lovable, accident-prone chef is still her same quirky self, as her brief appearance in the trailer teased. \n7. Those final four words will be satisfying -- but also controversial \n\"Gilmore Girls\" fans have waited almost a decade to hear the famed final four words with which Sherman-Palladino originally intended to end the series, which were abandoned when she left amid a contract dispute ahead of Season 7. The creator has teased that those mysterious words -- which are spoken in dialogue, most likely between Lorelai and Rory -- are the perfect punctuation mark to the revival, and stars Lauren Graham and Milo Ventimiglia have both stated that they're a lovely, fitting end to the show. Actor Matt Czuchry, however, recently told Entertainment Weekly that he believes they'll spark a \"heated debate\" among the show's loyal fans -- and after nearly a decade of build-up, he's probably correct. Whatever they are, we're still excited to hear them, though it's possible that they may not be the last words the Gilmore girls ever speak. \n\"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" premieres November 25 on Netflix.

      "text": "Netflix rebooted \" Gilmore Girls \" and We. Are. Here. For. It.\nAre you?\n\" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ,\" premieres this Friday, November 25, on Netflix. The fast-talking, pop-culture referential mother-and-daughter are a lot to handle, and if you haven't sat through the show's seven seasons, you're going to need a primer before jumping into the new mini-series.\nIf you have seen the show, you either love it (and probably signed at least one petition to revive the series somewhere at some point), or you think the characters talk way too fast and that \"no one could possibly be that smart and witty\" or knowledgeable about movies .\nRegardless of whether or not you've seen an episode, you probably recognize the show. And in either case, this post is for those who didn't just spend the last week marathoning all seven seasons of love, life, heartache and coffee. (But if you want to do that before watching the new season, no one's stopping you.)\nIf you know nothing and want to know (nearly) everything, then this warning can be ignored. But if you're still working through the series, beware there are spoilers ahead.\nMust-know info Let's catch up real quick: The original \" Gilmore Girls \" (no, they're not sisters) aired on television from 2000-2007 and focused on a mother-daughter duo. Yes, they have the same name. Yes, the mom is young -- she gave birth when she was 16. The two begin the series living in a charmingly quirky small town in Connecticut named Stars Hollow (which is modeled after a real-life small town ). Both Lorelais are beautiful, blue-eyed voracious readers and movie buffs who enjoy verbose conversations over coffee (or any food, really) and peppered with smart pop-culture references.\nThere are a lot of characters so here's a quick rundown (sans boyfriends) (actually sans a lot of people but we had to cut the list somewhere).\nLorelei Gilmore (played by Lauren Graham): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, street-smart, movie buff entrepreneur with a fondness for food and baseball-cap-and-plaid-wearing diner owners. Lorelei \"Rory\" Gilmore (Alexis Bledel): A coffee-loving, fast-talking, book-smart, movie buff with dreams of becoming a hard-hitting journalist; to avoid confusion, she goes by Rory. Richard and Emily Gilmore (Edward Hermann, Kelly Bishop): Lorelei's rich parents who have a sticky relationship with their \"hippie\" daughter, but think Rory is a perfect princess (usually). Luke Danes (Scott Patterson): Local disgruntled diner-owner who falls in love with Lorelei (the mom). Christopher Hayden (David Sutcliffe): Rory's somewhat-estranged father who appears whenever things are going just too well for the Gilmore ladies. April Nardini (Vanessa Marano): The daughter Luke never knew he had, she appears in Stars Hollow in season six and causes a whole mess of problems. Paris Geller (Liza Weil): Rory's high school nemesis turned college roommate-slash-best friend is quick with the insults . Lane Kim (Keiko Agena): Rory's kick-ass, music-buff best friend from Stars Haolow. Sookie St. James (Melissa McCarthy): A kooky chef and Lorelei's best friend. 35 Netflix's 'Gilmore Girls' revival looks even better than we imagined Best of the rest Now that you've got the basics down, here are the top things you should know.\nLuke and Lorelai sitting in a tree... maybe? Luke is the curmudgeonly owner of the town's corner cafe/meeting place, and for the first four seasons he and Lorelai are the epitome of \"Will they or won't they?\" They've been on and off since season five but the series ended on a high note for the pair. Early trailers for the revival have hinted at trouble in paradise, and the news that Christopher will appear in the revival could throw a wrench in their relationship.\nEpisodes to watch: \" Written in the Stars\" (Season 5, episode 3): Their first official date proves just how long we've all been pining for this relationship. Also, \"New and Improved Lorelai\" (S6E1), which is where they truly start planning their future.\nHello, nurse!\nPhoto by Netflix Team Dean, Team Jess, or Team Logan? Rory really knows how to pick 'em, boyfriends that is. (We only covered her important boyfriends, because who counts Marty?) (Poor Marty.) (Marty was the worst! Epitome of \"friend-zone\" victim.) Everyone has a favorite and the best news is they're all back (with a vengeance?!?). No matter which ex you side with, we can all agree on one thing: #TeamRory will always endure.\nDean Forester, played by Jared Padalecki (\" Supernatural \"), is the tall, handsome, gentle giant with a heart of gold. He's the first boy Rory meets in the pilot episode and he quickly becomes her first boyfriend, first love and first for a lot of firsts.\nJess Mariano, played by \" This is Us \" star Milo Ventimiglia, is her second important boyfriend. Obviously we're biased because we're #TeamJess. He's the super-literate bad boy of the bunch, but the truth is Jess challenges Rory mentally, something Dean never could. Yes, he has communication issues and needs to grow up, but what 17-year-old with daddy issues doesn't?\n#TeamJess all the way.\nPhoto by Netflix Logan Huntzberger (Matt Czuchry of \" The Good Wife \"). Even his name screams #firstworldproblems. OK, so it's cute that he calls her Ace, but less cute when he cheats on Rory and lets his father crush her journalist dreams. He's smart and provokes Rory in great ways (\"You climb up here with me it's one less moment you haven't lived.\"), but he's quite difficult and unlike Jess he doesn't seem to want to grow up for Rory. In the series finale, he proposed to Rory but she eschews the engagement for life as an independent woman .\nEpisodes to watch:\nDean: \"Raincoats & Recipes\" (S4E22): Sure, it's kind of nice when he builds her a car. But this ep, where they have sex for the first time, is arguably one of the most important in the entire series.\nJess: Prepare for heartbreak. The one where we meet this mysterious bad boy (S2E5), or the one where he tells her he loves her and runs away (S4E13), or the one where he comes back to ask Rory to run away with him but she just stares him down and says no (S4E21). Or! The one where she sees him read from his novel (S6E18) or the one where he gets so sad that she's using him to make Logan mad and talks her back into being a grown up. Sigh. Jess is great and deserves better. OK, OK if I have to pick just one I say \"The Bracebridge Dinner\" (S2E10). No, wait! \"Loralei's Graduation Day\" (S2E21) when Rory ditches school (gasp!) to head to NYC and spend the day with Jess. Ugh, I don't know, all 30-something of them, I guess.\nLogan: \"Norman Mailer, I'm Pregnant\" (S5E6): Rory really gets an introduction to Logan and the Life & Death Brigade. (And if you keep watching the next ep, we won't tell anyone.)\nEnlarge Image Richard Gilmore's presence looms large even in the revival.\nPhoto by Robert Voets/Netflix R.I.P. Richard Gilmore Richard Gilmore was the kind, wise, dapper AF father/grandfather you wish you had. Edward Hermann, the actor who played the Gilmore patriarch (Lorelai's father/Rory's grandfather) passed away in 2014 . Based on the trailer , the show is working this immeasurable loss into the narrative of the mini-series. His absence will be sorely felt , so make sure to keep a box of tissues handy.\nEpisodes to watch: \"Kill Me Now\" (S1E3): Our first outing with Richard and Rory proves just how important the patriarch's influence on the youngest Gilmore has been and will always be. And \"Wedding Bell Blues\" (S5E13), the series' 100th episode, for a glimpse at the inner workings of a devoted Gilmore family.\nThose last four words The genius behind \"Gilmore Girls\", creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, was not involved during the last season (season 7), resulting in a lackluster finale that left many fans unsatisfied. Many years ago, Sherman-Palladino, who makes a triumphant return as showrunner in the Netflix revival, shared the fact that she knew the exact four words the series would've ended on, but she's kept them top-secret. Now that she's getting a second chance to end the series on her terms, some fans are frothing at the mouth to fast-forward to the end to hear what those last four words will be.\nEpisode to watch: The pilot episode. The first four(ish) words were \"Please, Luke. Please, please (please).\" We're hoping for something more along the lines of \"I love you Jess,\" (not just because he's the only boyfriend Rory *never* said it to) but whatever, Luke is a pretty good constant too.\nThat's definitely not all But it is probably more than most people make it through. (We're not obsessed, but growing up at almost the same speed as Rory doesn't make it easy to avoid.) All caught up but still can't get enough?
