But the ordinary citizens and NGOs can stage a protest at strategic locations where she and her entourage has to pass. The very late announcement means there is very little time to organise or get the respective police permits. Still worth trying, though. Do something instead of expecting our leaders when we are fully aware they are bounded by ASEAN protocol. Source:",

This hopefully will prove to be great for customers, as the two banks compete for the same market with high sign-up bonuses and excellent perks.\nFor those looking for a fast-track to elite status, the options for making progress through credit card spend have been a bit slim so far. Once the American-branded Barclaycard options are released in 2017, five cards will allow some spending-based bonus for elite status:\nCiti/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard : 10,000 Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after $40,000 spend Barclaycard AAdvantage Aviator Red, Aviator Blue, Aviator Silver and Aviator Business MasterCard : 3,000 Elite Qualifying Dollars (EQDs) after $25,000 spend Barclaycard AAdvantage Aviator Silver MasterCard : Additional 3,000 EQDs after $50,000 spend (for a total of 6,000 EQDs) In addition to offering Admirals Club membership, the Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCar d card allows you to spend your way toward elite status As you can see, there’s only one card that allows you to avoid “butt in seat” EQMs: the Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard . For those who want to avoid flying 10,000 miles of American Airlines economy tickets (or 20,000 miles in economy on partner tickets or 5,000 miles of AA business/first tickets ), it’s going to be important to know the terms of how this bonus works. \nCiti just announced a minor (but important) change to which purchases will be eligible for the American Airlines 10,000-EQM bonus in 2017. Currently, purchases that post on the January-December statements count toward this spending goal. However, for the 2017 bonus, qualifying spending will be based on the calendar year:\nAs a Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive cardmember, you currently earn 10,000 Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after spending $40,000 in eligible purchases that post to your January through December billing statements.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the qualification period for earning EQMs will change and will be based on eligible purchases that post to your account during a calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st.\nPlanning on getting a jump start on your 2017 spending threshold by pre-paying your taxes? You better wait until 2017. Image courtesy of Stephen Ehlers via Getty Images. Say you were planning on paying estimated taxes or making year-end charitable contributions with your Citi/AAdvantage Executive card in 2016 after your December 2016 statement closes. Before this change, this spend would count toward the next year’s spending threshold. This year, this spending won’t count toward either the 2016 or the 2017 spending threshold. \nBottom Line \nThis change is likely minor for most cardholders, but it can have a major impact for those hoping to get a jump start on 2017’s spending threshold with 2016 year-end spending. You might want to ice your Citi/AAdvantage Executive World Elite MasterCard once your December statement closes and pick it back up in January.\nH/T: One Mile At A Time \nCiti® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® APPLY NOW Earn 50,000 American Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles after spending $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening* Admirals Club® membership for you with guest privileges* Complimentary Admirals Club® lounge access for authorized users Earn 10,000 AAdvantage® Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after you spend $40,000 in purchases within the year* No Foreign Transaction Fees on purchases* Earn 2 AAdvantage® miles for every $1 spent on eligible American Airlines purchases and 1 AAdvantage® mile for every $1 spent on other purchases* First checked bag is free on domestic American Airlines itineraries for you and up to eight companions traveling with you on the same reservation* Intro APR Regular APR Annual Fee Foreign Transaction Fee Credit Rating N/A 15.49% (Variable) $450 0% Excellent Credit ",

      "text": "by Gary Leff on December 1, 2016 \nI receive compensation for many links on this blog. You don’t have to use these links, but I am grateful to you if you do. American Express, Citibank, Chase, and other banks are advertising partners of this site. Any opinions expressed in this post are my own, and have not been reviewed, approved, or endorsed by my advertising partners. I do not write about all credit cards that are available -- instead focusing on miles, points, and cash back (and currencies that can be converted into the same). \nThere are two main benefits to the Citi premium American Airlines co-brand credit card, besides the signup bonus, in my opinion. \nElite qualifying miles for spending Scalable lounge access A Change to How the Card Earns Elite Qualifying Miles \nWhile only Barclaycard co-brands will let you earn elite qualifying dollars from spend , you can earn 10,000 elite qualifying miles after $40,000 spend in a year on the Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® . \nAnd they’re changing the way they calculate spend on the card for earning these qualfying miles. \nAs a Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive cardmember, you currently earn 10,000 Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after spending $40,000 in eligible purchases that post to your January through December billing statements. \nEffective January 1, 2017, the qualification period for earning EQMs will change and will be based on eligible purchases that post to your account during a calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st. \nSpend in a calendar year will really mean spend in a calendar year, which is much simpler and clearer in my view. The Best Way to Access American Airlines Admirals Clubs \nAs someone who flies American Airlines regularly, I place a high value on lounge access . It’s the people who keep me going especially during irregular operations, going above and beyond to get me where I’m going. As a result I’m very interested in the best way to get American Airlines club access. \nFor instance, agents have regularly double booked me giving me ‘backup’ flights just in case I misconnect. And I’ve even gotten a proactive call from a lounge about a delay, they had booked me as a backup on a new flight (that had looked sold out to me, and it was the last one of the night). And I’m not a Concierge Key member. \nEntrance to American Airlines Admirals Club Austin \nWhile American Airlines raised their prices for paid lounge memberships by $50 per year for individual memberships and by $100 for household memberships this past summer, they haven’t raised the price of the Citi Executive card and authorized users of the card remain free — and get lounge access . \nHere’s what it costs to buy lounge membership without the card. \nThe Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® comes with an Admirals Club membership and has a $450 annual fee. \nAmerican gives access to all authorized users of Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® cards. \nPrimary cardmembers can have up to 10 authorized users on their account. \nEach authorized user is allowed to bring in with them either immediate family members (spouse or domestic partner and children under 18 years of age) or up to two guests traveling with them. \nBuenos Aires Admirals Club \nEach of 11 Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® cardholders — primary and 10 additional — could bring in their spouse and minor children, or could bring in two guests in addition to themselves. That’s at least 33 people who can get into a lounge at once for a single credit card annual fee which is currently $450. Other Key Benefits of the Card \nThe Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive World Elite™ MasterCard® also gives you a signup bonus of 50,000 AAdvantage miles after spending $5,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening; priority check-in, screening, and boarding; first checked bag free for the primary cardholder and up to 8 travel companions on the same domestic reservation; and a reimbursement up to $100 for Global Entry or TSA Pre✓ application. \nPutting Green, American Airlines Admirals Club Austin",

      "text": "Bluebird Rockets On Myeloma Drug; Celgene Gets Boost (Investor's Business Daily) \nCiti’s Robyn Karnauskas said the positive early stage cancer study results from bluebird bio Inc (NASDAQ: BLUE ) is positive for CAR-T space and B-cell maturation antigen (BMCA) drugs of Juno Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ: JUNO ) and Kite Pharma Inc (NASDAQ: KITE ). \nChimeric antigen receptors (CARs) are proteins that allow the T cells to recognize a specific protein (antigen) on tumor cells. BCMA is a suitable target for CAR-expressing T cells, and adoptive transfer of anti-BCMA-CAR-expressing T cells is a promising new strategy for treating multiple myeloma. \nCambridge, Massachusetts-based bluebird bio said early data from its ongoing Phase 1 study of bb2121 showed objective anti-tumor responses in heavily pre-treated multiple myeloma patients. Bluebird bio is developing bb2121 in collaboration with Celgene Corporation (NASDAQ: CELG ). Study Highlights \nFollowing are the key highlights of the study: In highly refractory multiple myeloma, bb2121 shows 78 percent overall response rate (ORR), including 100 percent ORR at higher doses tested. bb2121 appears safe, with no DLTs or serious cases of cytokine release syndrome (CRS) or neurotoxicity observed. Safety profile was achieved with no anti-IL6/steroid treatment. Beyond The Blue \nGiven the safety profile, the results are likely to boost investor confidence in CAR-T, following Juno Therapeutics' recent clinical hold due to neuro-toxicity related deaths. \nImportantly, the analyst noted that bluebird's BCMA success is also a positive read-through for Juno and Kite Pharma as both are developing their own BCMA drugs for multiple myeloma and other B-cell malignancies. \n“Though we note that the data is still early, we believe that Bluebird's success provides clinical validation for using BCMA to target multiple myeloma,” Karnauskas wrote in a note. \nWhile Kite Pharma is expected to file IND for their fully-human KITE-585 in 2017, Juno expects to be in clinic as early as first half of 2017. \nAt last check, shares of bluebird surged 15.70 percent to $69.82. Meanwhile, Juno Therapeutics were up 0.25 percent to $20.10, while Kite Pharma fell 0.68 percent to $50.58. Latest Ratings for BLUE",

      "text": "Got this e-mail from Citi:\n\nQuote: We are making changes to your card benefits\nAs a Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive cardmember, you currently earn 10,000 Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after spending $40,000 in eligible purchases that post to your January through December billing statements.\nEffective January 1, 2017, the qualification period for earning EQMs will change and will be based on eligible purchases that post to your account during a calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st. There are no other changes being made to this benefit at this time. It took me three reads until I figured out what the actual change was, it's so minor. 10K EQM are earned for $40k in purchases that post through Dec 31, rather than purchases that post on your billing statements. Presumably, this means some people will get a few extra days to earn the EQM bonuses.\n\nHonestly I thought this is how it already worked.\n\nEdit: I know there's another thread. Mods alerted to merge. ",

      "text": "Minor Changes To Earning EQMs On The Citi AAdvantage Card In 2017 December 1, 2016 by lucky 5 Comments \nIn the interest of full disclosure, One Mile At A Time earns a referral bonus for anyone that’s approved through some of the below links. These are the best publicly available offers that we have found for each card. Opinions expressed here are the author's alone, not those of the bank, credit card issuer, airlines or hotel chain, and have not been reviewed, approved or otherwise endorsed by any of these entities. Please check out my advertiser policy for further details about our partners, including American Express, Chase, and Citi, and thanks for your support! \nAmerican is in a unique situation as far as the “big three” U.S. carriers go, as they have a non-exclusive credit card agreement. Rather than just having an agreement with one card issuer, American has credit card agreements with both Citi and Barclaycard . \nStarting in 2017, both issuers will have rights to different sales channels — Citi will have exclusive access to aa.com, direct mail, and Admirals Club lounges, while Barclaycard will have exclusive access to airport kiosks and inflight sales. \nFurthermore, it was recently announced that it will be possible to earn elite qualifying dollars (EQDs) through American’s co-branded Barclaycard products . American is introducing a revenue requirement for status in 2017, where you’ll have to spend $3,000, $6,000, $9,000, or $12,000 for Gold, Platinum, Platinum Pro, or Executive Platinum, respectively. \nHowever, you’ll be able to earn up to $6,000 EQDs by spending on a co-branded Barclaycard American Airlines card, as follows: AAdvantage Aviator Red, Aviator Blue, and Aviator Business MasterCard accounts can earn up to $3,000 EQDs by spending $25,000 on qualifying net purchases during the calendar year AAdvantage Aviator Silver MasterCard accounts can earn up to $6,000 EQDs by spending $50,000 on qualifying net purchases each calendar year; they’ll earn $3,000 EQDs after spending $25,000 on qualifying purchases and another $3,000 EQDs after $50,000 on qualifying purchases Earning elite qualifying miles with Citi AAdvantage Cards \nThe premium American Airlines Citi Card is the Citi ® / AAdvantage ® Executive World Elite ™ MasterCard ® , which is the only credit card that comes with an Admirals Club membership. The card also offers the opportunity to earn elite qualifying miles through credit card spend. Specifically, you can earn 10,000 EQMs after spending $40,000 on purchases in a year . \nUp until now we haven’t heard much about the future of this benefit. The good news is that in 2017 you’ll continue to be able to earn 10,000 elite qualifying miles per year through the Citi AAdvantage Executive Card (though you can’t get an elite qualifying dollar waiver with any Citi credit card). \nHowever, starting in 2017, there will be a very slight change to how this is calculated, per a notice that was just sent out: \nAs a Citi® / AAdvantage® Executive cardmember, you currently earn 10,000 Elite Qualifying Miles (EQMs) after spending $40,000 in eligible purchases that post to your January through December billing statements. \nEffective January 1, 2017, the qualification period for earning EQMs will change and will be based on eligible purchases that post to your account during a calendar year, from January 1st to December 31st. There are no other changes being made to this benefit at this time. See below for the disclosure. \nThis is a very minor change, but basically you’ll earn the 10,000 elite qualifying miles based on $40,000 of posted purchases between January 1 and December 31, rather than based on $40,000 of purchases posted from your January through December billing cycle (which typically won’t exactly correspond to a calendar year). \nHowever, the big news here is that you’ll continue to be able to earn EQMs with the Citi AAdvantage Executive Card , which I know a lot of people were worried about. \nThis continues to be a really lucrative credit card, especially since authorized users on this card get Admirals Club access as well . You can add up to 10 authorized users to this card at no additional cost, meaning you can essentially get Admirals Club access for 11 people through one annual fee. That’s incredible. \nAdmirals Club Tampa \nHave you taken advantage of the opportunity to earn 10,000 EQMs per year with the Citi AAdvantage Executive Card ? More from One Mile At A Time",

      "text": "Thumbnail December 02, 2016 09:00 AM Eastern Standard Time \nDEERFIELD, Ill.--( BUSINESS WIRE )--Citizens United for Research in Epilepsy (CURE) and Lundbeck today announced the launch of the CURE Education Enrichment Fund Scholarship Program, which is a one-time scholarship (up to $5,000) for people who are living with epilepsy, family members and caregivers. These scholarships will help advance the recipients’ personal knowledge in research, health education, advocacy and/or awareness as it relates to their experiences with epilepsy. \n“We have met so many amazing people in the epilepsy community who have a strong desire to make a difference in the lives of others who are struggling with this condition, and just need a little extra support to help make their ambitions a reality,” said Lorena Di Carlo, Vice President & General Manager, Neurology, at Lundbeck. “The Education Enrichment Fund will give people that much-needed support. This program expands upon Lundbeck’s long-standing commitment to the epilepsy community and dedication to empowering people who are living with epilepsy and their caregivers.” \n“The Education Enrichment Fund was partly inspired by CURE’s associate research director, Dr. Tracy Dixon Salazar, a stay-at-home mom determined to help her daughter who had been diagnosed with Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, a severe form of epilepsy,” said Robin Harding, Chief Executive Officer of CURE. “She began reading journal articles about the disease, studying biology, and soon returned to school, spending the next 15 years furthering her education. Dr. Salazar, now a Ph.D. in neuroscience and an epilepsy genetics researcher, has turned this passion into her life’s work, applying her knowledge to care for her daughter and empowering the epilepsy community through CURE. Hers is just one story of the power of knowledge and we are so thankful to Lundbeck for sponsoring this new program. We look forward to seeing the impact on patients’ lives that will come of it.” \nCURE awarded three scholarships through the Education Enrichment Fund pilot program earlier this year. While all applicants had truly inspirational stories and compelling reasons for wanting to further their education, three applications really stood out: A mother who struggled with not knowing the answer to her child’s epilepsy, but never gave up. After finally identifying a genetic cause, she helped form a non-profit foundation that provides support to other families who have had this same diagnosis. She plans to use her scholarship to learn how to effectively write grants and raise funds for research, while also learning best practices to advocate in the healthcare and political arenas. A sister who watched her little brother battle seizures daily and struggled to find a way to help him improve his quality of life. She realized that as a sibling of someone whose seizures dictated his entire life, it seemed appropriate that she devote hers to helping children, like her brother, who have been living with severe disabilities. She will be using her scholarship toward her recent acceptance into a nationally ranked Masters of Education program, where she will focus on educating children with severe disabilities. A young woman who developed epilepsy later in life, and fought the misconceptions and discrimination that surrounds people living with epilepsy every day. She is currently pursuing her Master’s in Public Health where she plans to use her scholarship to help her effectively advocate for her community and create policies to help improve the quality of life of people, just like her, who struggle with epilepsy and other chronic conditions. \nCURE is now accepting applications for the Education Enrichment Fund. The deadline to submit applications is April 15, 2017. To learn more about the scholarship program and to apply, visit www.CUREepilepsy.org . \nAbout Lundbeck \nLundbeck is a global pharmaceutical company specialized in psychiatric and neurological disorders. For more than 70 years, we have been at the forefront of research within neuroscience. Our key areas of research focus are depression, schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. \nAn estimated 700 million people worldwide are living with psychiatric and neurological disorders and far too many suffer due to inadequate treatment, discrimination, a reduced number of working days, early retirement and other unnecessary consequences. Every day, we strive for improved treatment and a better life for people living with psychiatric and neurological disorders — we call this Progress in Mind . \nOur approximately 5,000 employees in 55 countries are engaged in the entire value chain throughout research, development, manufacturing, marketing and sales. Our pipeline consists of several late-stage development programs and our products are available in more than 100 countries. We have research centers in China and Denmark and production facilities in China, Denmark, France and Italy. Lundbeck generated core revenue of DKK 14.6 billion in 2015 (EUR 2 billion; USD 2.2 billion). \nIn the U.S., Lundbeck employs nearly 1,000 people focused solely on accelerating therapies for brain disorders, including epilepsy. With a special commitment to the lives of patients, families and caregivers, Lundbeck U.S. actively engages in hundreds of initiatives each year that support our patient communities. \nFor additional information, visit www.lundbeckus.com and connect on Twitter at @LundbeckUS. \nAbout CURE \nCitizens United for Research in Epilepsy ( CURE ) is the leading nongovernmental agency fully committed to funding research in epilepsy. The organization was founded by Susan Axelrod and a small group of parents of children with epilepsy who were frustrated with their inability to protect their children from seizures and the side effects of medications. Unwilling to sit back, they joined forces to spearhead the search for a cure. \nSince its inception in 1998, CURE has been at the forefront of epilepsy research , raising more than $40 million to fund research and other initiatives that will lead the way to a cure for epilepsy. CURE funds grants for emerging and established investigators, and to date has awarded more than 200 cutting-edge projects in 15 countries around the world. \nCURE has led a dramatic shift in the epilepsy research community from simply treating seizures to enhancing understanding of underlying mechanisms and causes, so that cures and preventative strategies can be found. CURE's research program is cutting-edge, dynamic and responsive to new scientific opportunities and directions through both investigator-initiated grants and unprecedented scientific programs and initiatives. \nCURE ’s mission is to cure epilepsy, transforming and saving millions of lives. We identify and fund cutting-edge research, challenging scientists worldwide to collaborate and innovate in pursuit of this goal. Our commitment is unrelenting. \nUBR-C-00162",

      "text": "© 2016 Adweek All Rights Reserved Eleven of ‘Stranger Things’ Convinces People to Wear Funny Costumes and Shave Their Heads in Citi Campaign Advertisement Comment \nPublicis New York recently launched its first campaign for Citi under ECD Chris Van Oosterhout, who joined the agency in August after leading Nationwide at Ogilvy. \nThe work is most notable for starring Millie Bobby Brown, better known as Eleven from the Netflix series Stranger Things. \nThe purpose of the work is to “ start a national conversation about money. ” And while we do sort of feel like quite a few Americans are already talking about that very subject, the point of the campaign is that people would rather do almost anything than worry about their own finances. That was painful, but it keeps going. Here are some Upper East Side white collar women going to great lengths to avoid talking money in polite company. \nFinally, a friendly game of hoops gets a little too personal. \nNow we have to ask: would anyone ever spend time during a social gathering asking friends to compare how much of their income they stow away in savings? The one person with whom your humble blogger would ever broach that topic happens to be his wife, because only rich people hire financial advisers. \nThat said, we do agree on one thing: very few Americans know how to manage their own money. \nCiti CEO of global cards and consumer services Jud Linville said, “The campaign highlights our commitment to helping our clients address and solve their concerns in a sincere and human way. To us, it is about emotionally connecting with them, partnering with them to improve their financial lives and enabling their growth and progress.” \nThe campaign is getting some attention for the Stranger Things connection, but will it really convince Americans to talk money with their bros? \nAgency: Publicis Chief Creative Officer: Andy Bird Executive Creative Director: Chris Van Oosterhout Executive Creative Director: Jim Kotulka Executive Creative Director: Avery Gross Creative Director: Brett Simon Chief Production Officer: Lisa Bifulco Executive Producer: Jennifer Guliner",

      "text": "Citi has joined JPMorgan at the top of global regulators’ list of systemically important banks, replacing HSBC and meaning the U.S. bank will have to hold extra capital from 2019 to help preserve financial stability.\nThe group of 20 economies (G20) agreed after the 2007-09 financial crisis that top banks, whose size and complexity mean a collapse could wreak havoc in markets, should hold extra capital, according to the level of risk they present.\nMembers of the list of 30 lenders will also have to begin holding bonds from 2019 that can be written down to help replenish capital that is burned through in a crisis.\nIn the annual update of rankings published on Monday by the G20’s Financial Stability Board (FSB), Citi has replaced HSBC in the top “bucket” facing a 2.5 percent capital surcharge on top of global minimum requirements.\nNo lender joined or dropped out of the top 30 list this year.\nLenders on the list typically already meet or exceed the amount of capital they must hold due to pressure from regulators and markets to dispel any doubts about their resilience.\nHSBC joins BNP Paribas and Deutsche Bank in the next category down, with a surcharge of 2 percent. Bank of America rose a category to join them.\nBarclays dropped a category to the 1.5 percent surcharge group. Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and Wells Fargo rose a category to join the UK bank.\nMorgan Stanley fell a category to the 1 percent surcharge group.\nThe FSB is also due to agree a higher leverage ratio for the 30 lenders.\nThe ratio, a broad measure of capital to non-risk-weighted assets, has been set at a minimum of 3 percent for all other banks across the world.\nThe FSB has yet to decide if the 30 should be subject to the same leverage ratio “surcharge” or whether it too should adopt a “bucket” approach.\nThe watchdog also updated its list of nine globally systemically important insurers, which was unchanged from last year.\nInsurers still on the list in 2017 will be required to comply with tougher “loss absorbency” requirements from January 2019.\nThe list comprises Aegon, Allianz, AIG, Aviva, Axa, MetLife, Ping An, Prudential Financial, and Prudential.\nThe FSB’s latest list makes no mention of reinsurers, a category still being considered for inclusion.\nGlobal insurance regulators have said they may take into account the activities of insurers when they decide if they are globally systemic, rather than just focusing on size and global reach.\nMetLife, the biggest U.S. life insurer, has also been designated as systemically important by the Financial Stability Oversight Council, made up of the heads of U.S. financial regulators.\nThe company is fighting the U.S. designation in the country’s courts.\nSource: Reuters (Reporting by Huw Jones; Editing by Carolyn Cohn and Mark Potter)",

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Spurs thrash struggling Swansea, Sunderland registers much-needed win   5:11 pm \nTottenham Hotspur 5-0 Swansea City \nSpurs had plenty of the ball on home soil but it took until the six minutes before the break for them to break the deadlock. \nDele Alli won a penalty from Kyle Naughton near the side of the box, and Harry Kane gladly thudded the spot-kick home . \nHeung-Min Son doubled the score in more glamourous circumstances as his acrobatic volley flew past Lukasz Fabianski, who had previously been doing well to keep Tottenham at bay. \nAfter the break, it got even better for Pochettino’s men as Kane thumped home inside the box after an excellent counter attack involving Christian Eriksen, Alli, and Son. \nSomewhat scrappily, Eriksen made it four as he bundled the ball following Alli’s deflected shot on goal, and then slotted home another in added time to make it 5-0. \nAnd the humiliating defeat leaves Bob Bradley’s Jacks rooted to the bottom of the table. \nSunderland 2-1 Leicester City \nThe threat of relegation became even clearer to the Foxes on Saturday afternoon as they lost to the Black Cats. \nRobert Huth’s own goal put Sunderland ahead as Claudio Ranieri’s men struggled to get to grips with the game. \nAnd, after Patrick van Aanholt saw appeals for a penalty turned down, Jermain Defoe thrashed the ball home after Duncan Watmore’s strike was blocked with 77 minutes on the clock. \nShinji Okazaki did get one back for the reigning Premier League champions but it wasn’t enough as Sunderland held on. \nCrystal Palace 3-0 Southampton \nThe Eagles needed some good luck after last week’s 5-4 defeat to Swansea City, and got it in unbelievable circumstances as Fraser Forster missed his kick, allowing Christian Benteke to open the scoring from just five yards. \nJames Tomkins doubled the score after 36 minutes, sweeping the ball in from close range when a corner found its way into the six-yard box. \nSouthampton rallied and saw several chances fall to them, but failed to put any into the back of the net. \nAnd to round off an excellent afternoon, Benteke polished off a cut-back from Jason Puncheon, helping them up into 13th place in the table. \nStoke City 2-0 Burnley \nJon Walters proved he’s still got plenty to offer the Potters as he met Mame Biram Diouf’s cross and arced a delicate finish over Paul Robinson and into the net. \nMark Hughes’ men grabbed a second ten minutes before half-time when a slow counter attack saw Marc Muniesa meander forward and then volley home from nine yards out. \nWest Brom 3-1 Watford \nThe Baggies went in front as Jonny Evans rose highest at the back post to nod in a Chris Brunt corner, and the supplier became the scorer not long after as the Northern Irish star saw his strike, after a set-piece routine, rattle into the bottom corner. \nChristian Kabasele got one back for the Hornets but, as they attempted to snatch an equaliser, Roberto Pererya was sent off. \nAnd to ensure all three points went to the Baggies, Matt Phillips cut in from the flank and thumped home a left-foot shot. \n–",

      "text": "EPL on Citi FM: Spurs thrash struggling Swansea, Sunderland registers much-needed win By Talksports Previous | Next \nTottenham Hotspur 5-0 Swansea City Spurs had plenty of the ball on home soil but it took until the six minutes before the break for them to break the deadlock. \nDele Alli won a penalty from Kyle Naughton near the side of the box, and Harry Kane gladly thudded the spot-kick home . \nHeung-Min Son doubled the score in more glamourous circumstances as his acrobatic volley flew past Lukasz Fabianski, who had previously been doing well to keep Tottenham at bay. \nAfter the break, it got even better for Pochettino's men as Kane thumped home inside the box after an excellent counter attack involving Christian Eriksen, Alli, and Son. \nSomewhat scrappily, Eriksen made it four as he bundled the ball following Alli's deflected shot on goal, and then slotted home another in added time to make it 5-0. \nAnd the humiliating defeat leaves Bob Bradley's Jacks rooted to the bottom of the table. \nSunderland 2-1 Leicester City The threat of relegation became even clearer to the Foxes on Saturday afternoon as they lost to the Black Cats. \nRobert Huth's own goal put Sunderland ahead as Claudio Ranieri's men struggled to get to grips with the game. \nAnd, after Patrick van Aanholt saw appeals for a penalty turned down, Jermain Defoe thrashed the ball home after Duncan Watmore's strike was blocked with 77 minutes on the clock. \nShinji Okazaki did get one back for the reigning Premier League champions but it wasn't enough as Sunderland held on. \nCrystal Palace 3-0 Southampton The Eagles needed some good luck after last week's 5-4 defeat to Swansea City, and got it in unbelievable circumstances as Fraser Forster missed his kick, allowing Christian Benteke to open the scoring from just five yards. \nJames Tomkins doubled the score after 36 minutes, sweeping the ball in from close range when a corner found its way into the six-yard box. \nSouthampton rallied and saw several chances fall to them, but failed to put any into the back of the net. \nAnd to round off an excellent afternoon, Benteke polished off a cut-back from Jason Puncheon, helping them up into 13th place in the table. \nStoke City 2-0 Burnley Jon Walters proved he's still got plenty to offer the Potters as he met Mame Biram Diouf's cross and arced a delicate finish over Paul Robinson and into the net. \nMark Hughes' men grabbed a second ten minutes before half-time when a slow counter attack saw Marc Muniesa meander forward and then volley home from nine yards out. \nWest Brom 3-1 Watford The Baggies went in front as Jonny Evans rose highest at the back post to nod in a Chris Brunt corner, and the supplier became the scorer not long after as the Northern Irish star saw his strike, after a set-piece routine, rattle into the bottom corner. \nChristian Kabasele got one back for the Hornets but, as they attempted to snatch an equaliser, Roberto Pererya was sent off. \nAnd to ensure all three points went to the Baggies, Matt Phillips cut in from the flank and thumped home a left-foot shot. \n–",

      "text": "Print This General Manager for Diamond Cement, Tati Ramarao Diamond Cement has disclosed to Citi Business News it is still considering its decision to lay off fifty percent of the company’s staff over reports that it cannot sustain its operations. Though Diamond cement has not ruled out redundancy of some of the workers, it believes the decision will become necessary when market conditions do not change. “We have not started laying off any of the real staff; we are now considering the situation. If nothing changes, then we will undertake the redundancy exercise,” the General Manager for Diamond Cement, Tati Ramarao explained. Diamond cement has announced plans to reduce its staff strength by half by the end of November 2016. The company, among others cited high operational cost and reduced profitability as some of the reasons that have necessitated the downsizing of the human resource. At the time, Mr. Ramarao explained at the press conference that the lax in Ghana’s regulatory systems that allows foreign companies to import cement into the country at relatively cheaper costs, made local production unproductive. He further criticized the Trade and Industry Ministry over for failing to respond to several appeals over the alleged takeover by some foreign cement companies. According to him, not only have the foreign companies increased their dominance on the Ghanaian market, they have also succeeded in competing with the local companies in the retail of cement. Though there have been reports that some ancillary workers of Diamond cement have been already affected by the move, the company’s General Manager maintains that no core staff has been laid off yet. “We are not really seeing a major boost in operation but as I indicated the decision will be inevitable if the current conditions persist,” he stressed. Currently, Diamond cement provides direct and indirect employment to about 1000 people. This is from the company’s operations in Aflao, Tema as well as other parts of the country. Concerns over the influx of imported cement has been revived quite recently by the local cement manufacturers. Their latest agitations were triggered by a decision by the Trade Ministry to permit a Korean company, Fujian, to import about 500,000 tonnes of cement into Ghana to shore up the annual supply of the product. Meanwhile, the Consumer Protection Agency (CPA) has since mounted a strong case against any decision to restrict other foreign companies in the retail of cement. The Agency contends that the increased supply will push down prices to benefit consumers.",

My best friend, on the other hand, has a CITI AAdvantage credit card.\n\nIf she pays for my flight with her card, is it true that 1) I will get miles for the actual number of miles of the trip (as the actual traveler), and 2) she will get miles just for the cost of the ticket paid for through her credit card? Or will only one of us get the points?\n\nIf you have links for sources from AA.com, that would be amazing. I've looked extensively but can't get a clear understanding of how this works.\n\nThanks!

      "text": "by Gary Leff on December 4, 2016 \nCathay Pacific’s AsiaMiles is an American Express and Citi transfer partner. They’ll also be introducing a US credit card in a few months from a bank that doesn’t issue (and therefore conflict with) other frequent flyer cards and that will have a few really interesting features. \nThey’re also offering a 30% bonus converting hotel points to miles through December 31. You don’t get the bonus instantly, instead the extra 30% will post by March 31 (or sooner). \nHere are the programs you can transfer in from and earn the bonus: \nGenerally there’s a pretty big loss with hotel points transfers to miles, except for: \nStarwood, which gives 25,000 miles for transferring 20,000 points with most partners Marriott, when redeeming travel packages \nWith this promotion 20,000 Starpoints yields 32,500 Cathay Pacific AsiaMiles. \nOr 270,000 Marriott points (which is also 90,000 Starpoints, since Starpoints transfer to Marriott at 1:3) gets you 110,500 AsiaMiles and 7 nights in a category 1-5 hotel property. \nAsiaMiles has a distance-based award chart with some strong values. \nCathay Pacific is a oneworld airline and you can redeem for US domestic travel on American (or Alaska). Their award chart for premium transcons on American is cheaper than American’s own pricing — 50,000 miles roundtrip for New York JFK – Los Angeles in business class (versus 65,000 American miles). \nMy first-ever redemption on AsiaMiles was British Airways Baltimore – London Heathrow – Barcelona – London Heathrow – New York JFK when I had dinner at El Bulli . Back then it only cost 60,000 miles roundtrip and I got those miles transferring eBay Anything Points. Transatlantic business class is still just 80,000 miles roundtrip for the short East Coast hop across the pond or 120,000 in first class.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story “It is imperative that we turn Citi Bike fully into a public good and a resource for our lowest income communities,” Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, a Democrat from northern Manhattan, said at a recent City Council hearing on the program’s future. \n  Citi Bike   might not extend to all five boroughs unless the city is willing to help pay for it, an idea that the administration of Mayor Bill de Blasio, a Democrat, is considering. For some elected city officials, the arrival of Citi Bike in Jersey City last year was yet another slight for their oft-neglected communities. “How could Citi Bike go to New Jersey before it goes to all five boroughs?” Ruben Diaz Jr., the Bronx borough president, said in a statement last week. “The city in Citi Bike has to mean something.” Motivate, the company that runs Citi Bike, said focusing on central neighborhoods with a higher demand was the only way to stabilize the failing system it took over about two years ago. Citi Bike has grown to nearly 120,000 annual members, up from about 84,000 members last year; and to about 10,000 bikes, from 6,000 when Motivate took over. But it still has plenty of challenges, including the herculean daily effort to restock bikes where they are needed. “I do not believe that you can look to a big expansion without some degree of public support,” Jay Walder, Motivate’s chief executive, told City Council members at the recent hearing. Polly Trottenberg, the city’s transportation commissioner, said some city financing would probably be needed, noting that New York City’s system was the only bike-share program in the country that did not receive public money. Installing new stations costs about $6,000 per bike, she said, and a citywide system could require as many as 80,000 bikes. She said the city had begun to discuss the next round of expansion with Motivate, but declined to say how much financing the city might provide. Another challenge for Citi Bike is attracting a diversity of riders, including low-income residents, minorities and women who have been slow to embrace the bikes. The company works with community groups to recruit new riders and offers residents of public housing a discounted monthly rate of $5, opposed to the regular $14.95. About 1,100 people have joined through the public housing program. When a Citi Bike station appeared in front of her home at the Walt Whitman Houses in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, Shaquana Boykin barely noticed. “I thought Citi Bike was very expensive,” Ms. Boykin said. “I didn’t have any education to what it was.\" Photo Shaquana Boykin of Fort Greene, Brooklyn, who joined Citi Bike at a discounted rate through a public housing program. Riding the bikes, she said, made her feel “like a little kid again.” Credit Bryan Thomas   With a discounted membership, Ms. Boykin, 26, said she now rode every day unless it was raining, snowing or under 40 degrees. She leads community rides to farmers’ markets in Brooklyn and uses the bikes so often that each ride costs her about 9 cents — much less than a $2.75 MetroCard swipe. \n  “I felt like a little kid again,” she said of getting back on a bicycle. In Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, at the outer edge of Citi Bike territory, membership has grown to 5,381 members, up by nearly 2,000 people since last year, when Citi Bike began working with a local nonprofit to attract riders. Some of the strategies have included community rides to make residents more comfortable on bikes and marketing posters highlighting minority riders. “There was a perception that the bike share system was not for us, that it was part of gentrification,” said Tracey Capers, an executive vice president at the nonprofit Bedford Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation. “We wanted to change the conversation to show people it was for them.” Despite a similar campaign to attract women , female riders still account for less than a third of regular Citi Bike users. Women often cite concerns over traffic safety and the inconvenience of having to carry a helmet or change clothes after a ride. The share of female members grew slightly this year to 32.7 percent, up from 31.5 percent in 2015, according to Citi Bike. The company said it did not have comparable figures for race or income because it does not ask members for such information. Many New Yorkers across different races, incomes and genders are concerned about riding safely on harrowing city streets. Though traffic crashes remain a persistent problem, no Citi Bike riders have died in an accident since the system started in 2013 . But overall cyclist deaths in the city are up this year. There were 17 deaths so far in 2016, compared with 14 during the same period last year, city officials said. Some bike riders believe Citi Bikes are safer because they are slower than personal bikes, or their bright blue hue is more noticeable to drivers. But safety advocates say there is another reason: the current Citi Bike zones have good access to bike lanes. They have called for more bike lanes as part of Mr. de Blasio’s Vision Zero plan to reduce traffic fatalities. Using Citi Bike offers many benefits, advocates say: It is an easy way to exercise, a more affordable travel option than using subways, buses or taxis, and provides flexibility for moving between areas that are not connected by subway lines. Still, even in neighborhoods that have Citi Bike, many people are reluctant to try it. On a recent sunny afternoon, a bike station outside the Marcy Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant was filled with 23 bikes; not a single slot was empty. \n  “I don’t use it — I don’t have a credit card,” Andrew O’Keefe said as he stood near the station. Mr. O’Keefe, 28, who works in construction, said he would consider using Citi Bike if the machines accepted cash — a common concern for those living paycheck to paycheck or who have poor credit. Rudolph Strelis, a graduate student at Pratt Institute, said he had used Citi Bike about three times this year, but he did not like the time limit. Mr. Strelis, 25, said he often saw people using the station, but he preferred to take the subway. “It’s not really convenient that you have to dock the bike every 30 minutes,” he said. (Extra fees apply for longer trips.) Destiny Coppedge, a 27-year-old security guard who lives at Marcy Houses, said she had never rented a Citi Bike, but her cousin used them with the $5 discounted rate. Ms. Coppedge said she had practiced riding a bike at her sister’s home on Long Island, so she would eventually feel more comfortable riding in the city. “I’m scared to ride in the streets,” Ms. Coppedge said.",

      "text": "Citi Makes a Clarion Call for Commodity Bulls With 2017 View (3) Ranjeetha Pakiam Dec 05, 2016 8:20 am ET (Bloomberg) -- Citigroup Inc. has given a clarion call for commodity bulls, predicting that most raw materials are expected to perform strongly next year as global economic growth picks up, the oversupply that’s dogged markets finally dissipates and investors plow in more funds. The bank is bullish on oil, copper, zinc, and wheat on a six to 12-month horizon, with global growth seen at 2.7 percent from 2.5 percent in 2016, according to an e-mailed report. It’s bearish on coal and iron ore -- describing this year’s out-performance in bulks as a fluke -- and gold and soybeans. Commodities have made a comeback this year after sinking to a quarter-century low in January as the oil market shows signs of rebalancing after a glut, and base metals rally on prospects for rising demand. Citigroup has flagged its optimism about raw materials in 2017 since at least July, and other banks have also turned more positive. Last month, Goldman Sachs Group Inc. recommended an overweight position for the first time in four years. “For commodities in general, the oversupply that was induced by high prices in the first decade of this century are finally being balanced,” analysts led by Ed Morse wrote in the note. “What’s more, the cost structures across commodities are reaching an end of a period of persistent and record deflation.” The Bloomberg Commodity Index has advanced 12 percent in 2016 after a five-year losing run that was spurred by a slowdown in China’s growth and gluts in everything from copper to crude oil. This year, advances in raw materials have been led by zinc, nickel, copper, Brent crude and sugar. Citigroup laced its bullish outlook with warnings. Volatility is likely to pick up as markets rebalance and as developments in China shift prices, according to the bank. It cited the potential impact of government policy in Asia’s top economy, as well as heightened investor flows in futures. Trump Risks While Donald Trump’s victory in the U.S. election may bolster fiscal policy, his move away from globalization may pose a risk to the outlook for growth, Citigroup said. Trump’s election highlights a key risk, according to the bank, which flagged the potential for rising tensions, including trade wars. Among the bank’s picks for 2017, oil may outperform the rest of the energy complex as the first OPEC production cut in eight years accelerates the balancing of the market, according to the report. In copper, the bank raised its 2017 average price target 9 percent to $5,575 a metric ton. The metal traded at $5,856 by 12:41 p.m. in London. Iron ore’s 2016 advance, as well as that in coal, “was a fluke, and largely a result of domestic politics in China confronting market forces that remain inherently bearish,” Citigroup said. “The overall bearish iron ore outlook still holds,” it said, forecasting prices will drop every quarter next year.

      "title": "How Citi FinTech Is Living Up To Its Name",
      "text": "Share \nIt’s not easy being big. Or being big and regulated. \nAmong other things, it makes running a footrace with FinTech startups — tough. Big and regulated banks — especially these days — are not set up to sprint. Decades of legacy infrastructure and a web of regulations make it tough to adopt a “move fast and break things” mantra — even if the regulators would allow it. \nSo, established banks have to think differently about what it takes to enter the race and win it. That race is all about acquiring and engaging a digitally savvy customer who wants a different experience from their bank. \n“That change presents us with a tremendous opportunity to adapt to a digital customer’s needs by leveraging the customer-centric philosophy that’s been the hallmark of our financial institution for the last 200 years,” Carey Kolaja told Karen Webster in an interview prior to the launch of Citi FinTech’s new mobile banking hub for Citigold customers. \nThe new Citigold Experience for the Citi Mobile App (for the iPhone) is getting its public coming out party today (Dec. 6). The app as designed will allow customers to combine their banking, wealth management and money movement capabilities all in a one-shot digital location. The new app also features expanded authentication options for users, including biometric login via fingerprint, voice or facial recognition, as well as PIN. \nKolaja is global chief product officer for Citi FinTech, a new unit of Citigroup primarily focused on reimagining mobile banking experiences. She said the new unit launched a year ago with a simple directive: Rethink the firm’s position to find a way to create innovative experiences for digital banking customers — and then get them to market fast. \nEasier said than done, you say. Isn’t this the same Citibank that has tens of thousands of employees, millions of customers and scores of services all spread out all over the world, is a 200-year-old institution that has legacy built on top of legacy systems and technology and, as a global financial institution, is regulated on a scale and scope that most people would find dizzying? \nYes, that Citibank. And thus, the challenge of becoming more agile, while adhering to the high-quality standards that are the cornerstone of the bank, and of staying “very, very focused” on putting a product in the market that checks those boxes while moving at FinTech speed. \n“That’s really where we started,” Kolaja said. \nA statement that kicked off the candid conversation between Kolaja and Webster as they chatted about the launch of Citi FinTech’s new mobile product. A statement that triggered a logical follow-up question: In the face of global regulations and massive compliance complexities, can big banks really move fast? \n\nDealing With ‘Compliance Debt’ \nKolaja admitted that compliance challenges are — and will be — a massive and constant factor to be dealt with. \n“It’s not easy dealing with 200 years of legacy, technology and compliance debt,” she noted. \nBut not impossible, once the right principles are put in place. \nStarting with recognizing that driving change was something that Citi FinTech could not — nor wanted to — do “ourselves.” \n“I think there are a lot of places with a very exclusive ‘build it here’ culture, and to make the product work, we really had to invert that way of thinking,” Kolaja said. \nThat has meant, for one thing, working actively to partner with FinTech startups, either directly or through white-labeling their services. Making those partnerships really work means getting them involved right up front and keeping them engaged so that all of the parts of the design process are progressing in tandem instead of in silos bound to disrupt each other’s progress. \nAnd having a clear focus and path to success. Kolaja noted that the launch of Citi FinTech wasn’t designed to go globally throughout all of Citibank. Instead, it is only in the U.S. and focused on a single segment of its massive global customer base. \n\nThe Importance Of Listening \nKolaja emphasized that customers drove the development of the mobile app. \n“We are very proud of the fact, within 12 days of our launch in November of last year, we were talking to customers,” she said. \nKolaja said that Citi FinTech understanding how its customers think about their money and their relationship to it was critical. She said that they talked to over 2,500 customers and showed those customers who opted in to being part of the feedback loop updates every two weeks. From there, they were able to refine the app to reflect what was important and what might have been nice to add. \nThat resulted in giving the customer a totally new experience from Citi from the moment they log into the app. Gold customers will be able to open new brokerage accounts from their phone going forward and trade directly in the app. The app will also make it possible for customers to find and access their financial advisor in a matter of minutes and decide what level of direct services they need, including how they wish to authenticate themselves across the platform. \nAlso on the roadmap is the ability for customers to instantly send money domestically and internationally, where consumers can specify exactly how actively, or passively, they want their security authorizations to go through. \nThe view is strategic, said Kolaja. Citi FinTech is designed to be the nimble, creative end of the bank — one that can design and perfect the kinds of features that can be integrated back across the massive Citi platform worldwide. \nBecause, at the end of the day, banks do have something that no one else does. \n\nConsumers Really, Really Trust Banks \nNegative headlines and some ill feelings about the Great Recession and the mortgage lending crisis aside, Kolaja noted that what tends to get left out of most discussions of the stodgy, old banks waiting to be disrupted is the simple reality that customers actually like their bank. \nAnd they more than like them — they really trust them. One of the benefits of banks being subject to all of those complex compliance rules is they tend to give customers some level of comfort that their money is actually being correctly controlled and managed. Consumers have remained largely loyal to banks, and that gives the institutions a massive amount of scale to leverage. \nBut to do that, banks have to start really getting back to offering consumers what they want and need and in a way that is comparable to the more agile and responsive players, Kolaja said. \nCiti FinTech thinks it can square the circle between speed and size and find new ways to innovate, while still providing the highly stable services that consumers have come to expect. \nAnd win the race, with many of its FinTech partners running right alongside it.",

      "title": "Citi® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature® Card Review",
      "text": "Credit Cards | Expert Reviews | Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card Review Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card Review   \nIt’s rare to find a travel rewards card that doesn’t have an annual fee. Sure, there are some basic, no-fee travel rewards credit cards. But having one of these credit cards is like owning a car with no options. Many no-fee airline cards will only give 1 mile for every $2 spent, and have few benefits. But, airline and hotel cards that impose expensive annual fees can also offer priority service and fee waivers to travelers. These cards also offer one point or mile per dollar spent. \nOne of the few exceptions to this rule is the Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card. It offers a competitive rate of points for you spending, along with entry level Silver elite status with the Hilton HHonors™ program. Also, it offers a fast track to mid-level Gold status and several travel insurance and purchase protection policies. Remarkably, you get all these benefits without having to pay an annual fee. \nAs a result, this card is best for people who are looking for a no-fee travel rewards card that provides actual value. It offers valuable perks and benefits when you stay at over 4,600 Hilton properties. These include brands ranging from the Hampton Inn to the Waldorf Astoria. And when you use this card for your everyday purchases, you earn points towards free night stays at any Hilton property. Earning More Points on Everyday Spending Too \nFor each dollar spent, you earn 2 points in the Hilton HHonors™ program. You also get 3 points per dollar spent at supermarkets, drugstores, and gas stations. Finally, you get six points per dollar spent at any of the Hilton hotels, which includes over a dozen different brands. \nThe rewards you earn from charging your hotel stay to this card are in addition to the points Hilton HHonors™ members always earn at hotels. You earn 10 base points for every dollar spent at most Hilton properties, and more points if you have elite status in the Hilton HHonors™ program. \nFinally, you can also earn another 10,000 Hilton HHonors™ Bonus Points each calendar year. You just need to spend $1,000 or more on stays at Hilton hotels (all brands). Redeem Points for Free Hotel Nights \nThe Hilton HHonors™ program offers free nights with no blackout dates or capacity controls. This means that if they have an unsold, standard room, you can use your points to book it. You can do this even if it’s during the peak travel season or a special event. \nAward nights start at 5,000 points for a Category 1 property, but can be as high as 95,000 points for a Category 10 hotel or resort. But a typical mid-range hotel will often be 30,000 - 40,000 points per night. And while this seems like a lot of points, remember that you will earn at least 2 points per dollar with this card, and often more. \nYou also have other options for using your points. These include credits towards hotel purchases, car rentals, gift cards, and experiences. But with these options, you will rarely receive as much value per point as you do with free hotel nights. \nFinally, Hilton lets you exchange points to miles with some airlines, but the exchange rate is so poor that you shouldn’t consider it. In most cases, you have to exchange 10 Hilton points just to get 1-1.5 airline miles. Automatic Elite Status \nOne of the most attractive things about this card is that you can get elite status and enjoy special treatment at all the Hilton hotels. Thankfully, just having the Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card gives you Silver status, which offers you a 15% bonus on your base points earned. This means that you will always earn 11.5 base points per dollar from your hotel stay. You then earn another six points when you charge your room to your Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card, for a total of 16.5 points per dollar. If you are on a business trip and spend four nights in a hotel at $150 a night, then you’ll earn a total of 9,900 points. \nSilver elite status also offers you several other benefits. These include discounted room rates and complimentary Internet service. Silver elites also enjoy late checkouts, and free access to the fitness centers. Plus, having Silver status lets you get a fifth night free when you redeem four consecutive nights with your points. \nBetter yet, this card also offers two different ways to earn Gold status. First, you can fast-track to HHonors™ Gold status by completing four stays within 90 days of opening your account. Or you can earn Gold status when you use your card to spend $20,000 on purchases within a calendar year. \nWith Gold status, you receive all the perks of Silver status, plus a 25% bonus on your base points. You also get hotel benefits that vary by brand that can include room upgrades, bonus points, and even free breakfasts. Card Perks and Protections for Easier Travel \nAs a no-fee travel rewards card, the Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card offers a competitive array of benefit for both travel and shopping. When traveling, you receive the basics like: Worldwide rental car insurance Travel accident insurance Access to a 24/7 travel and emergency assistance hotline Lost baggage protection policy that covers you if your checked or carry–on luggage is lost, stolen, or damaged \nWhen shopping with this card, you receive other benefits. Damage and theft protection that covers you for repairs or a refund if what you buy is damaged or stolen within 120 days of purchase (90 days for New York residents). You are also covered by Citi’s Price Rewind service . This service offers you a refund of the difference if a covered purchase is found for a lower price within 60 days of purchase. \nAnd as a Visa Signature card, you can get a range of travel and shopping discounts. In fact, you even receive access to hard to get tickets for entertainment and sporting events. APR and Other Fees Are Normal for a Travel Card \nA rewards card will always have a higher interest rate than a similar card that doesn’t offer rewards. The Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card is not an exception, but it’s interest is competitive for a card of this type. But if you’re going to be carrying a balance on your credit card, than you should be looking for a card with the lowest possible interest rate , which won’t be a rewards card. \nThis card’s fees for things like late payments and balance transfers are about where they should be, but there is one exception. Citi imposes a 3% foreign transaction fee on all charges processed outside the United States. Sadly, this card is a poor choice for use on your next international trip. How This Card Compares to Other Citi Cards Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve Card \nThe Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card is the entry-level product for less than frequent travelers. But the Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve is the expert level card for real road warriors. It offers 10x points for Hilton stays, 5x points on airline and car rental purchases, and 3x points on everything else. It also starts you out with Gold status and let’s you earn top-tier Diamond Status if you make $40,000 of purchases within a calendar year. These additional rewards and benefits might be worth the $95 annual fee for those who travel often enough. It also has no foreign transaction fee, so it’s great for international use . Citi ThankYou ® Premier \nThis premium rewards card isn’t affiliated with a particular hotel or airline. Instead, it offers points in Citi’s ThankYou ® Rewards program that can be transferred to Hilton HHonors™ points or to frequent flyer miles 13 different airline partners and the Hilton HHonors™ program. This card offers 3x points for all travel purchases, 2x points for dining and entertainment, and 1x for all other purchases. Points transfer to Hilton at a 1:1.5 ratio, but to airlines at a 1:1 or lower rate. There’s a $95 annual fee for this card and it has no foreign transaction fees. Citi Prestige ® Card \nThis is Citi’s top-of-the-line rewards card that also earns points in its ThankYou ® Rewards program. It offers 3x points for air travel and hotel spending and 2x for dining and entertainment charges. You earn one point per dollar spent elsewhere. It comes with many perks including airport business lounge access and numerous travel and shopping benefits. You also receive a fourth night free when you book four or more nights through Citi’s travel agency. However, all these benefits come with a whopping $450 annual fee. But there are no foreign transaction fees. Bottom Line \nThe Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Visa Signature ® Card offers rewards and benefits that measure up extremely well against other travel reward cards with no annual fee. But ultimately, this card is best for less frequent travelers. \nI like to have cards like this so that I can enjoy better service, even if I only stay at a Hilton hotel a couple times a year. If you find yourself checking into Hilton Hotels every few months, then you should consider the Citi ® Hilton HHonors™ Reserve card or perhaps even the Citi ThankYou ® Premier or Citi Prestige ® card. By adding this card to your wallet, you can earn valuable rewards at Hilton properties and enjoy the treatment normally reserved for frequent travelers. Did you enjoy this article? Yes No Oops!

      "text": "Rewiring Citi for the digital age Article Actions Download this article Citigroup’s Head of Operations and Technology describes the bank’s efforts to accelerate its digital transition, as well as the importance of having the right talent and agility to pull it off. \nCiti’s legendary chairmanWalter Wriston noted years ago that information about money has become almost as important as money itself. The bank’s Head of Operations and Technology, Don Callahan, believes that today, in the digital age, Wriston would surely drop the qualifier to his famous observation, noting: “Information simply is as important as money.” Video \nThis is apparent as Callahan surveys the 21 st -century banking terrain: digital competitors are massing on every front—from fintech start-ups to new divisions of global institutions—while the speed of every banking process and customer interaction accelerates daily. All this change requires a focus on agility, Callahan says, which in turn demands a cultural rewiring. \nAt the helm of Citi’s digital transformation, Callahan is helping drive new thinking across the bank. He points to Citi’s digital lab for start-up innovations, powerful new apps for customer smartphones, and, internally, a push to expand capabilities across cloud computing and big data and analytics that enable automation and machine learning. In an interview with McKinsey’s James Kaplan and Asheet Mehta, Callahan describes what it takes to mobilize digital change at one of the world’s leading financial institutions. \nThe Quarterly : What are the top-of-mind risks for you as you continue Citi’s transition to a digital bank? Sidebar Don Callahan biography Don Callahan is Head of Operations and Technology at Citigroup. \nDon Callahan: I think the biggest risk for the industry is whether it will be able to move fast enough. Are we going be able to think and execute swiftly? A lot of people talk about being agile. Agility is a lot more than how our developers approach an issue. “Agile” now is a group of subject-matter experts coming together from each walk of life—someone who is a true developer collaborating with someone who is a product manager who knows how to listen to the customer or the client. And then the real test is whether they take that, put it together as an idea, and bring that story to life. In addition, if it is not right, can they move on and come up with the next version fast enough? \nThe Quarterly : So, give us an example of agility at work. \nDon Callahan: An example right now is work that Stephen Bird, CEO of Global Consumer Banking, is leading. We know we have to be mobile first, and we are doing a lot there. In order to be all-in on mobile, we have set up a “lean team” in our Long Island City office, with about 100 people who are operating in a very agile way. \nIt doesn’t operate like a traditional bank; it is much more like a creative team. They are incorporating feedback, putting up designs on a wall, and testing directly with customers. They are experimenting and coding. I’m seeing the speed, the curiosity, and the execution at levels I’ve never seen before. \nThe Quarterly : And this is helping you step up the pace? \nDon Callahan: Yes. On the consumer-banking side, one of the most exciting projects for us was how fast we were able to come up with a product offering for the Apple Watch. I received a phone call on the day IBM and Apple made the announcement that they were going to work together. And someone from our consumer business asked me if we could be the first financial-services app on the Apple Watch. We worked with a senior team at Apple, with IBM, and at Citi to develop the first banking app for the watch. We did it all in 120 days. \nThe Quarterly : If you think about the opportunity to create digital financial services—you are a 204-year-old bank with all the resources and capabilities that implies. In some cases, you may be competing against much newer, smaller, nimbler start-ups. What does that imply? \nDon Callahan: The competition has changed. It’s not just the peer bank down the road or across the ocean. Today, it can be a start-up in Silicon Valley or Silicon Alley. We welcome that kind of competition. It makes us stronger and that much faster. I also think there is plenty we can learn from them, and there are opportunities for us to all work together. \nThe common denominator most start-ups have, including ones I have had the chance to visit, is they truly have a blank slate. Because of that, they are able to take the art of the possible and bring it swiftly to market. For some companies, that is going to require fresh thinking, including welcoming change and embracing new ideas. \nThe Quarterly : In terms of digital transformation, how do you think the culture and the skills of the IT organization at Citi will evolve over the course of the next five years? \nDon Callahan: As technology changes, we are going to be have to adapt accordingly. Over the last five years, we have continued to enhance our capabilities at Citi. We have changed all of our significant platforms globally, as well as our core hardware and architecture. In the process, we have also been able to achieve dramatic savings. As a result, we have state-of-the-art technology across Citi that is running at an optimum cost structure. \nLooking forward to the next five years, we are going to have to continue to build upon those efforts. For example, we are going to have to become very comfortable embracing the cloud, our private cloud, our multitenant cloud, and our public cloud. We must get comfortable with the idea of true automation—robotics, machine to machine, cognitive, and so much more. \nThe question becomes how do you actually apply that within Citi? So, the culture and the curiosity of our tech team and our operations team will need to look at opportunities for change. \nI will give you an example that I find particularly important. As we looked at accounts payable, we realized it is repeatable work and fairly predictable. That is a perfect situation to place a “bot” on it. This enables people who are doing those jobs, whether it is in Budapest, Tampa, or Costa Rica, to perform functions that are even more valuable, deliver more results, and provide better career-growth opportunities. \nThe last part of the culture I think we need to change is embracing data throughout the industry. Data is truly the lifeblood of an organization, in my mind. We are seeing the value being created for our clients and our customers by being able to help them at all stages. I believe big data is absolutely going to be an area in which there will be more focus and opportunity to drive value for clients. Of course, we will be careful to do all of this in a way that is secure and privacy protective. \nThe Quarterly : Is that starting to happen? \nDon Callahan: Yes. For example, we are able to look at the supply chain for a very large manufacturer. Because we have the data and the permission to look at it, we could examine every aspect of the supply chain down to country by country, almost by subsupplier and then sub-subsupplier. And what you could see are opportunities for synergies, as well as for cost savings and rationalization. You could also look at opportunities for M&A and then take those insights to develop strategic ideas for our clients. It allows a different dialogue with the CEO and the CFO. It was one of the first great examples where I could see such great complexity presented in an easy interface. You could identify the graphical insights that were present and then turning those into business ideas. For me, it is a foreshadowing of what is to come. \nThe Quarterly : Digital multiplies the security risks. What’s your strategy in this area? \nDon Callahan: The challenge we face today, regardless of which industry you are in, is that the goal posts are moving every day. And it is extraordinarily sophisticated. At the same time, the access point to be able to do harm to an organization is actually lowering. The cost of entry, to provide real disruptive capabilities, is dropping. The capabilities of the individual attacker are increasing. \nAt Citi, we have transformed our overall strategy around information security, and we now have what we call an intelligence-lead model. So it is no longer just looking at trying to secure the gate, or to wrap it with firewalls. We are now trying to make sure that we can look at what threat factors are coming in and that we have critical understanding of where those threats will manifest themselves around different client subsegments. We take privacy of client information very seriously and make sure that our data collection, use, and sharing is done in a manner that meets client and customer expectations and complies with law and regulation. \nThe Quarterly : You have talked about a very different model inside IT—a very different model for the business, too, as you become digital. What is it going to take for Citi to get the required talent? Raising your Digital Quotient Read the article \nDon Callahan: Talent is such a critical area of focus for us, and, in particular, for me in the technology space. I probably spent over four hours today on talent alone—on interviewing talent, trying to attract talent, and working with my team on the overall talent agenda. Right below us is the Borough of Manhattan Community College. It has about 26,000 students, and what we are finding within those halls are people who love computer science. They are from diverse backgrounds and from all parts of the globe. It is a wealth of opportunity. \nAnother thing that we are doing is working closely with universities all across the world, from Oxford to Cornell. We are working with Cornell right now as they are building out the new tech campus here in New York to help build a discipline around information security. And then, we are bringing in teams for special projects on information security and looking to see if they are the right fit for someone at Citi. \nThe Quarterly : What’s needed on the talent front to compete with start-ups and with fintech companies? \nDon Callahan: I think to compete with start-ups, we have to make it exciting and we have to be purpose driven. I haven’t run into one person at a start-up who is there simply to do a job. It is the passion about building a business that we need to tap into. \nThe insights we are getting from the teams we are hiring now is so impressive. We need to continue to be aggressive about the talent we are hiring—people with the necessary digital awareness and the ability to think and act in an agile way.

(For related reading, see: Mobile Banking: How Big Banks Are Innovating With Fintech. ) New Plans for Wealthy Clients \nCiti is enhancing its Citigold experience, adding a dedicated relationship advisor and financial advisor to clients with qualifying balances of $200,000 and above. In addition, the service includes unlimited refunds on third-party ATM fees, the ability to earn the highest level of Citi ThankYou Points, dedicated onshore 24/7 customer service, complementary financial planning, and access to Citi’s market insights and global research. \nFor those with balances between $50,000 and $199,999, Citibank’s Citi Priority provides on-demand financial guidance from financial advisors, digital money management tools, waived fees on deposit products, and preferred pricing on mortgages and other credit products. Clients also have access to global travel benefits such as no foreign exchange fees on debit cards with no monthly service fees if the minimum balance is maintained. \n“The new Citigold provides best-in-class service, dedicated teams, preferred pricing, personalized guidance and global benefits to help clients achieve their financial goals,” said Venu Krishnamurthy, president, business head with Citigold & Citi Priority and Citi Personal Wealth Management. “Through these new offerings, we are pleased to bring the full breadth of our global expertise to our clients and in the weeks to come, we will launch enhanced digital and mobile capabilities.” \nIn conjunction with these launches, the bank is sponsoring events across New York City, including The Museum of the City of New York’s exhibit, “New York at Its Core,” the debut of Citigold branded Citi Bikes, and a range of client events. (For related reading, see: How Advisors Can Use Tech to Capture Leads. ) Implications for the Industry \nAccording to a 2015 study by Spectrem Group , more than 60% of high- and ultra high-net-worth respondents and 51% of mass affluent clients have switched advisors over their lifetimes. Performance was the most cited reason for leaving, but not being proactive enough was listed as a secondary reason. Citi’s team addresses this problem by providing clients with instant access to professionals to help ensure clients are on the right track. \nThere are also more than 15.5 million affluent Millennials in the U.S. with at least $100,000 in investable assets outside of real estate, according to a LinkedIn whitepaper. These individuals stand to inherit nearly $60 trillion in personal wealth that will need to be managed. Citi is looking to more effectively target these individuals by introducing enhanced digital and mobile capabilities that have become a must-have for the lucrative demographic. \nFinancial advisors may want to take note of these trends when developing their own offerings as the market becomes more competitive. By combining personalized service with technology, advisors can address many of the shortcomings that lead these individuals to switch advisors. Proactively addressing these problems can reduce churn and make it easier to capture market share among affluent clients. The Bottom Line \nCiti recently announced the launch of Citigoldand Citi Priority to better target affluent client demographics and increase market share. As part of this push, the financial services company plans to combine personalized services with enhanced digital and mobile capabilities over the coming weeks. The move reflects an ongoing trend towards meeting the high demands of affluent clients, with a focus on the affluent Millennials.

      "text": "Costco ( COST ) appears to be poised to benefit not only from the switch to Visa ( V ) / Citi ( C ) credit cards, but continued strong traffic as the holiday shopping season ramps into full throttle.\nCostco, which generates most of its operating income from its membership fees, saw a net sales increase of 3% in November, with same-store sales up 1%. Nomura analyst Jessica Schoen Mace noted that while the first half of the month was negatively impacted by the U.S. presidential election, traffic and sales \"picked up significantly in the back half of the month.\"\nThe membership warehouse company reports fiscal first-quarter results after the market close on December 7.\nAmong items for investors to keep an eye on aside from traffic trends are deflation, which Goldman Sachs analyst Matthew Fassler said has \"weighed on sales for retailers around the ecosystem.\" Assuming these deflationary trends end, there's the potential \"for meaningful recovery as prices level off,\" Fassler added.\nCosto last raised its membership fee, which starts at $55 for the basic Gold Star Membership, in 2011. However, many analysts are expecting the company to announce a price increase, despite no announcement so far.\nFassler pushed out the membership fee increase by one quarter, now expecting it to happen in the fiscal second quarter.\nAnalysts surveyed by Yahoo! Finance expect the company to earn $1.20 a share on $28.29 billion in revenue.\nThese three ETFs may benefit it investors like what Costco has to say.",

      "text": "Citi trader exacerbated October’s pound ‘flash crash’ Katie Martin and Caroline Binham 7 Mins Ago Financial Times SHARES \nThe UK investigation into October's \"flash crash\" in sterling has focused heavily on the Japanese trading operations of Citigroup, which fired off repeated sell orders that exacerbated the pound's fall, according to bankers and officials involved in the inquiry. \nCiti's traders are not believed to have started the slide in the currency in thin Asia trading but its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years, bankers and officials said. The value of the pound fell from $1.26 to $1.14, with a 9 per cent slide in about 40 seconds. TORU YAMANAKA | AFP | Getty Images Traders ckeck computer screens showing the Japanese yen rate against the British pound at a brokerage in Tokyo on October 7, 2016. \nThe Bank of England has said publicly that the October 7 crash is \"set apart by the lack of a clear fundamental trigger\" but its investigation of the event focused on a single incident, according to a person briefed on the probe. \nPeople with knowledge of events at Citi that day said one of the US bank's traders placed multiple sell orders when the currency slumped in unusually fragile market conditions. One of the people said the trader \"panicked\". \nThe incident raises questions on the quality of supervision and risk management at the biggest bank in the foreign exchange business. In the wake of the crash, UK regulators have written to several banks telling them to shore up oversight of the foreign exchange desks to prevent similar shocks. \nCiti said in a statement that it \"managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period\". It declined to say whether anyone had been disciplined or whether it had changed any trading practices in light of the incident. \nMore from the Financial Times: Why did the pound fall so fast? \nInvestigators from the BoE's Prudential Regulation Authority who probed the October 7 drop were not particularly concerned by the initial trigger, people briefed on the inquiry said. Jerky moves are not uncommon in the dead of night, and sterling was on a fragile footing with support undermined by the impact of the vote to leave the EU. \nBut people involved in the investigation said the second stage of the slide coincided with a large number of rapid-fire sell orders placed in Tokyo by a Citi trader using an electronic tool known as \"Aggregator\", which sends trade instructions into a range of trading venues. A trader at another bank said at the time that was when \"all hell broke loose\" with the pound. \nFor a short time, orders to sell sterling met with zero buying interest on the other side — a highly unusual event — due to abnormally poor liquidity and entrenched bearishness about the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. \nNonetheless, the sell instructions from Citi's desk in Tokyo kept coming and started tripping over each other in a pattern known as \"looping\" that is normally constrained by safety nets embedded in bank trading tools. Citi declined to comment on whether those safety nets, which are part of the Aggregator programme, were operating at the time of the flash crash for its own traders. \nCiti was not the only trading desk selling at that point, and the bank was not seeking to make a profit, multiple people briefed on the events said. Rather, they said, the trader panicked, jamming through enough trades to magnify the slide. \nA Citi spokeswoman said the drop in sterling followed \"a news event\" at an \"extremely illiquid\" time of day, a reference to a Financial Times report that night that President François Hollande of France had said he would seek a tough line on Brexit. The BoE, however, said in its semi-annual financial stability report that the FT news story \"was not the initial trigger\". show chapters Monday, 10 Oct 2016 | 3:49 AM ET | 04:20 \nHuman error and the use of a \"poorly calibrated execution algorithm\" were among the possible reasons for the sell-off, the BoE said, without naming any particular bank or banks. \"It is hard to definitively rule out these possibilities as not all activity in the foreign exchange market is observable,\" the BoE concluded. \nThe BoE declined to comment on the role played by Citi or any other bank in the incident. \nTypically, it is close to impossible for a small handful of trades to move a major currency by such a large degree, because there is usually a wide range of buyers and sellers at any time. But on October 7, the BoE noted that during the worst point of the fall in sterling, \"there was a drop off in participation on key trading systems, which points to a potentially greater role for the idiosyncratic actions of individual market participants\". \nThe BoE suggested the selling was too aggressive for market conditions at the time, noting that the flows \"may have occurred without regard to underlying market conditions or [the] likely price impact of trading.\" \nUK regulators are keen for banks to learn lessons from what went wrong on the night of the flash crash. The Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates markets, and the PRA declined to comment, but people privy to their work say they have since jointly written to a clutch of the market's biggest dealing banks, telling them to ensure they are vigilant on the risk of market dislocations at illiquid times of day and that electronic trading tools are equipped with proper safety features. \nThe Bank for International Settlements, which monitors global money flows, is working on its own detailed report on the crash, with input from the BoE, to be released in January. \nAdditional reporting by Chris Giles and Leo Lewis Related Securities",

      "text": "Money News | Wed Dec 7, 2016 | 3:48pm IST Citi says behaved appropriately in sterling \"flash crash\" By Patrick Graham | LONDON \nLONDON Citi said on Wednesday that its trading operations functioned appropriately in a thin and illiquid market during October's \"flash crash\" in sterling, responding to a Financial Times report that a trader at the U.S. bank exacerbated the pound's fall. \nThe FT cited unnamed bankers and officials as saying that Citi’s traders were not believed to have started the slide in the currency but that its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years. \n\"Sterling fell sharply following a news event just after midnight UK time, when the GBP spot foreign exchange market was extremely illiquid,\" Citi, the biggest player in the $5 trillion a day global currency market, said. \n\"Citi managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period.\" \nThe Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements, whose markets committee is overseeing an investigation into the crash with input from the BoE, had no immediate comment on the Financial Times report. \nThe pound dived and rebounded by about 10 percent in a few minutes at the start of Asian trading on Oct. 7, an unprecedented swing for a major currency at an hour when the market is at its lowest ebb. \nThe moves added to the hefty losses the pound has suffered since June's British vote to leave the European Union. There were also some sales of UK assets by investors worried over the stability of the currency and its impact on inflation. \nMarket participants generally agree the sell-off was at least worsened by the algorithmic machine trading that makes up much of the global currency market, while some have speculated the initial move may have come from electronic news gathering software or other parameters used in trading programmes. \nThe final report from BIS is due in January, although officials say it will probably focus on how the market as a whole functioned and it is not clear if it will discuss the role of particular institutions and orders in the slide. \n(Reporting by Patrick Graham, editing by Nigel Stephenson/Jermey Gaunt) Next In Money News",

Learn more... \nWed, Dec 7, 2016, 11:34 GMT - UK Markets close in 4 hrs 56 mins Citi says behaved appropriately in sterling \"flash crash\" Reuters - UK Focus – 1 hour 17 minutes ago \n(Adds more background) \nBy Patrick Graham \nLONDON, Dec (Shanghai: 600875.SS - news ) 7 (Reuters) - Citi said on Wednesday that its trading operations functioned appropriately in a thin and illiquid market during October's \"flash crash\" in sterling, responding to a Financial Times report that a trader at the U.S. bank exacerbated the pound's fall. \nThe FT cited unnamed bankers and officials as saying that Citi's traders were not believed to have started the slide in the currency but that its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years. \n\"Sterling fell sharply following a news event just after midnight UK time, when the GBP spot foreign exchange market was extremely illiquid,\" Citi, the biggest player in the $5 trillion a day global currency market, said. \n\"Citi managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period.\" \nThe Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements (Euronext: STTL.NX - news ) , whose markets committee is overseeing an investigation into the crash with input from the BoE (Shenzhen: 200725.SZ - news ) , had no immediate comment on the Financial Times report. \nThe pound dived and rebounded by about 10 percent in a few minutes at the start of Asian trading on Oct (HKSE: 3366-OL.HK - news ) . 7, an unprecedented swing for a major currency at an hour when the market is at its lowest ebb. \nThe moves added to the hefty losses the pound has suffered since June's British vote to leave the European Union. There were also some sales of UK assets by investors worried over the stability of the currency and its impact on inflation. \nMarket participants generally agree the sell-off was at least worsened by the algorithmic machine trading that makes up much of the global currency market, while some have speculated the initial move may have come from electronic news gathering software or other parameters used in trading programmes. \nThe final report from BIS is due in January, although officials say it will probably focus on how the market as a whole functioned and it is not clear if it will discuss the role of particular institutions and orders in the slide.

      "text": "  \"Panicked\" Citi Trader \"Who Fired Off Repeated Sell Orders\" Behind Pound Flash Crash Dec 7, 2016 7:23 AM 0 SHARES \nIn what may be the latest example of unintended irony, shortly after the October 7 pound sterling flash crash, which saw the UK currency plunge by more than 9% against the dollar, falling from $1.26 to $1.14, in about 40 seconds - a historic flash crash in one of the world's most liquid currencies - we presented a forensic explanation of what happened in that minute when sterling plummeted in a bidless market from Citigroup . \n\nAs it turns out, Citi may indeed have been the most familiar with the dynamics behind the pound crash because according to a new report from the FT , it may have been responsible for it. According to the report, a UK probe into October’s “flash crash” has focused heavily on the Japanese trading operations of Citigroup, \" which fired off repeated sell orders that exacerbated the pound’s fall, according to bankers and officials involved in the inquiry.\" \nWhile Citi’s traders are not believed to have started the slide in the currency in thin Asia trading, its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years, the FT said. The value of the pound fell from $1.26 to $1.14, with a 9 per cent slide in about 40 seconds. The Bank of England has said publicly that the October 7 crash is “set apart by the lack of a clear fundamental trigger” but its investigation of the event focused on a single incident, according to a person briefed on the probe. \nSo what happened that exacerbated the plunge? In one word: panic. \nPeople with knowledge of events at Citi that day said one of the US bank’s traders placed multiple sell orders when the currency slumped in unusually fragile market conditions . One of the people said the trader “panicked”. \nAs the FT logically notes, \"the incident raises questions on the quality of supervision and risk management at the biggest bank in the foreign exchange business. In the wake of the crash, UK regulators have written to several banks telling them to shore up oversight of the foreign exchange desks to prevent similar shocks.\" \nFor its part Citi is defending itself: Citi said in a statement that it “managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period”. It declined to say whether anyone had been disciplined or whether it had changed any trading practices in light of the incident. \nWhile investigators the BoE’s Prudential Regulation Authority who probed the October 7 drop were not particularly concerned by the initial trigger, they were more interested by the second stage of the slide which \"coincided with a large number of rapid-fire sell orders placed in Tokyo by a Citi trader using an electronic tool known as “Aggregator”, which sends trade instructions into a range of trading venues. A trader at another bank said at the time that was when “all hell broke loose” with the pound.\" \nIt was this \"Aggregator\" response that led to a bidless market: for a short time, orders to sell sterling met with zero buying interest on the other side — a highly unusual event — due to abnormally poor liquidity and entrenched bearishness about the pound in the wake of the Brexit vote. \nAt that point, things got worse: \nNonetheless, the sell instructions from Citi’s desk in Tokyo kept coming and started tripping over each other in a pattern known as “looping” that is normally constrained by safety nets embedded in bank trading tools. Citi declined to comment on whether those safety nets, which are part of the Aggregator programme, were operating at the time of the flash crash for its own traders. \n... and worse: \nCiti was not the only trading desk selling at that point, and the bank was not seeking to make a profit, multiple people briefed on the events said. Rather, they said, the trader panicked, jamming through enough trades to magnify the slide. \nA Citi spokeswoman told the FT that the drop in sterling followed “a news event” at an “extremely illiquid” time of day, a reference to a Financial Times report that night that President François Hollande of France had said he would seek a tough line on Brexit. The BoE, however, confirmed our own reporting on the crash, and said in its semi-annual financial stability report that the FT news story “was not the initial trigger ”. \nSo for those who got stopped out and lost massive amount of money, who should you blame? Well, panicked traders and miscalibrated robots to start: \nHuman error and the use of a “poorly calibrated execution algorithm” were among the possible reasons for the sell-off, the BoE said, without naming any particular bank or banks. “It is hard to definitively rule out these possibilities as not all activity in the foreign exchange market is observable,” the BoE concluded. The BoE declined to comment on the role played by Citi or any other bank in the incident. \n\nTypically, it is close to impossible for a small handful of trades to move a major currency by such a large degree, because there is usually a wide range of buyers and sellers at any time. But on October 7, the BoE noted that during the worst point of the fall in sterling, “there was a drop off in participation on key trading systems, which points to a potentially greater role for the idiosyncratic actions of individual market participants”. \n\nThe BoE suggested the selling was too aggressive for market conditions at the time, noting that the flows “may have occurred without regard to underlying market conditions or [the] likely price impact of trading”. \nIn other words, while Citi may or may not have led to a historic flash crash in the pound, nobody really still knows anything, and some Indian trader living in his parents' house in London may still get the blame. \nSome further thoughts on the incident courtesy of Mint's Bill Blain: \nThemes for next year range from “Normalisation” but also “Protectionism” and “Political Consequences”- a significant risk in my mind ahead of European elections. Meanwhile, without any particular conviction today, markets are vulnerable to a number of pitfalls in the thin holiday markets. \n\nAs the headlines in the FT this morning are about how Citibank in Tokyo precipitated the October flash crash in Sterling in an illiquid overnight market when its “poorly-calibrated” algo-driven HST trading “Aggregator” went into meltdown, its worth remembering how skittish thin markets are to modern no-see-em trading blunders. \n\nThe Sterling flash crash story is intriguing - the excuse is the market was fragile and a trader panicked. What? Since when is trading (arguably) the worlds most liquid currency cross, Cable, fragile or subject to panic? A failure of liquidity versus modern technology? Or something more – fuelled by Brexit uncertainty and trading programmes that don’t understand the subtle nuances? \n\nAccording to the FT, the BOE noted “a drop off in participation of key trading systems, which points to a potentially greater role for the idiosyncratic actions of individual market participants”. I should imagine there are some very nervous Citi currency execs out there! \nMore information is coming: the BIS, which monitors global money flows, is working on its own detailed report on the crash, with input from the BoE, to be released in January. One day we hope the BIS, and especially Benoit Gilson , will release a similar analysis for at least of the countless flash crashes observed in gold over the years.",

      "text": "0 Photo: Bloomberg \nA Financial Times report this morning is stating that a trader from Citi might have been implicated in the British pound’s October ‘flash crash’. Sterling’s value collapsed against the U.S. dollar from 1.26 to circa 1.14 in about 40 seconds. \nThe fall is said to have been impacted by the Asian trading desk of Citi in Tokyo. According to the report, the investigation into the matter has mentioned the Japanese trading operations of Citigroup for sending repeated sell orders to the market. \nThe desk is not believed to have started the slide, but is said to have “played a key role”. “human error” and/or a “poorly calibrated execution algorithm” \nFT’s report highlights that sources with knowledge of the matter said that a particular trader placed multiple sell orders on the GBPUSD market. Throughout a very intensive time on the market, the trader was described as “panicked” by one of the London-based newspaper’s sources. \nAn official statement by Citi outlines that the bank’s trading operations functioned well during the thin and illiquid market conditions as the GBP flash crash event unfolded. \n“Sterling fell sharply following a news event just after midnight UK time, when the GBP spot foreign exchange market was extremely illiquid. Citi managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period,” the bank elaborated. \nAccording to the FT’s report, the first stage of the crash was not concerning to the regulators, but the second round is said to have been caused by “rapid-fire sell orders placed in Tokyo by a Citi trader”. The trader is said to have been operating via an aggregator to send substantial quantity of orders to various market places. \nAfter the event other traders are saying to have witnessed the extraordinary move that was exacerbated by the steady stream of sell instructions from Citi’s Tokyo trading desk. \nThe FT’s report elaborates on the order flow: “orders started tripping over each other in a pattern known as “looping” that is normally constrained by safety nets embedded in bank trading tools.” \nThe Bank of England on its part has outlined “human error” and/or a “poorly calibrated execution algorithm”. The BoE has not elaborated on which trading desks have been under examination nor which banks have played a role in the flash crash.  ",

      "text": "Citi says behaved appropriately in sterling 'flash crash' Wed Dec 7, 2016 5:23am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Patrick Graham \nLONDON (Reuters) - Citi C.N said on Wednesday that its trading operations functioned appropriately in a thin and illiquid market during October's \"flash crash\" in sterling, responding to a Financial Times report that a trader at the U.S. bank exacerbated the pound's fall. \nThe FT cited unnamed bankers and officials as saying that Citi’s traders were not believed to have started the slide in the currency but that its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years. \n\"Sterling fell sharply following a news event just after midnight UK time, when the GBP spot foreign exchange market was extremely illiquid,\" Citi, the biggest player in the $5 trillion a day global currency market, said. \n\"Citi managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period.\" \nThe Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements, whose markets committee is overseeing an investigation into the crash with input from the BoE, had no immediate comment on the Financial Times report. \nThe pound dived and rebounded by about 10 percent in a few minutes at the start of Asian trading on Oct. 7, an unprecedented swing for a major currency at an hour when the market is at its lowest ebb. \nThe moves added to the hefty losses the pound has suffered since June's British vote to leave the European Union. There were also some sales of UK assets by investors worried over the stability of the currency and its impact on inflation. \nMarket participants generally agree the sell-off was at least worsened by the algorithmic machine trading that makes up much of the global currency market, while some have speculated the initial move may have come from electronic news gathering software or other parameters used in trading programs.

      "text": "\nLimited-time bonus. The Citi® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite™ MasterCard® , from our partner Citi, has increased their sign-up bonus with a limited-time offer. Here are the updated card highlights:\nFor a limited time, earn 50,000 American Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles after making $3,000 in purchases within the first 3 months of account opening* First checked bag is free on domestic American Airlines itineraries for you and up to four companions traveling with you on the same reservation* Enjoy Group 1 Boarding on American Airlines flights* No Foreign Transaction Fees on purchases. Receive 25% savings on in-flight food and beverage purchases when you use your card on American Airlines flights* Double AAdvantage® miles on eligible American Airlines purchases* Earn 10% of your redeemed AAdvantage® miles back – up to 10,000 AAdvantage® miles each calendar year* Annual fee is $95, waived for the first 12 months. Note the following fine print:\nOFFER AVAILABILITY \nAmerican Airlines AAdvantage® bonus miles are not available if you have had any Citi® / AAdvantage® card (other than a CitiBusiness® / AAdvantage® card) opened or closed in the past 24 months.\nTo clarify, you can have one of both the consumer version of this card and the CitiBusiness business version under your name. The bonuses are also separate. You can get one consumer bonus every 24 months, and you can also get one business bonus every 24 months.\nThis card also makes you eligible for Reduced Mileage Awards , where you save up to 7,500 miles on roundtrip MileSAAver® awards to select destinations on American Airlines operated flights. Combine this with the 10% rebate on redeemed AAdvantage miles, and you can stretch your miles a lot further.\nBottom-line. This limited-time offer is a 20,000 miles increase from the previous 30,000 mile offer. The annual fee is also waived during the first year. Since you can only get one of these bonuses once every 24 months, it it is best to wait for such a bumped-up bonus. As with most of these co-branded cards, a lot of the potential value comes when you fly on American and use the free first checked bag benefit ($50 per person, roundtrip) and also when you redeem miles. \nCiti® / AAdvantage® Platinum Select® World Elite MasterCard® application page \n“Disclaimer: This content is not provided or commissioned by the issuer.

      "text": "FG appoints Citi, Stanbic, SCB for $1bn Eurobond December 8, 2016 Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun Ifeanyi Onuba and Stanley Opara The Federal Government has appointed Citigroup, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC Bank as advisers on its planned $1bn Eurobond, the Minister of Finance, Mrs. Kemi Adeosun, has said. She said this followed her presentation of a memorandum on Wednesday at the Federal Executive Council meeting seeking approval for the issuance of the Eurobond in the International Capital Market and the appointment of transaction parties responsible for the execution of the programme. The minister, in a statement issued by her Media Adviser, Mr. Fetus Akanbi, said that the $1bn Eurobond issuance would provide funds to support the implementation of capital projects in the 2016 budget. Apart from Citigroup, Standard Chartered Bank and Stanbic IBTC Holdings Plc, she gave names of other appointed transaction parties for the execution of the bond as White & Case LLP, Banwo & Ighodalo and AfricaPractice. She stated that the selection was based on an open and competitive bid process in line with the Public Procurement Act, 2007 and that a certificate of ‘No objection’ was received from the Bureau of Public Procurement to award contracts to the recommended parties. The statement quoted her to have said, “We have so far received strong commitment from the international community. Investors believe in the long-term economic outlook for Nigeria as we continue with our structural reforms and increased focus on infrastructure development to diversify the economy and grow the non-oil sector. “Stable oil prices and steadying foreign reserves will support our plans and we expect high demand for this issue to further push down yields. We are confident that this will be a successful outing in January 2017.” Copyright PUNCH. All rights reserved.

      "text": "By Patrick Graham\nLONDON (Reuters) - Citi said on Wednesday that its trading operations functioned appropriately in a thin and illiquid market during October's \"flash crash\" in sterling, responding to a Financial Times report that a trader at the U.S. bank exacerbated the pound's fall.\nThe FT cited unnamed bankers and officials as saying that Citi’s traders were not believed to have started the slide in the currency but that its Tokyo desk played a key role in sending the pound to its lowest levels in 31 years. \n\"Sterling fell sharply following a news event just after midnight UK time, when the GBP spot foreign exchange market was extremely illiquid,\" Citi, the biggest player in the $5 trillion a day global currency market, said.\n\"Citi managed the situation appropriately and our systems and controls functioned throughout the period.\"\nThe Bank of England and the Bank of International Settlements, whose markets committee is overseeing an investigation into the crash with input from the BoE, had no immediate comment on the Financial Times report.\nThe pound dived and rebounded by about 10 percent in a few minutes at the start of Asian trading on Oct. 7, an unprecedented swing for a major currency at an hour when the market is at its lowest ebb.\nThe moves added to the hefty losses the pound has suffered since June's British vote to leave the European Union. There were also some sales of UK assets by investors worried over the stability of the currency and its impact on inflation.\nMarket participants generally agree the sell-off was at least worsened by the algorithmic machine trading that makes up much of the global currency market, while some have speculated the initial move may have come from electronic news gathering software or other parameters used in trading programmes.\nThe final report from BIS is due in January, although officials say it will probably focus on how the market as a whole functioned and it is not clear if it will discuss the role of particular institutions and orders in the slide.\n\n(Reporting by Patrick Graham, editing by Nigel Stephenson/Jermey Gaunt)",
