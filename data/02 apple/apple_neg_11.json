      "text": "ShepherdsvilleKentucky Friday night duelist back in swing, though there was only 3 of us. Not sure it's ever gonna grow, but I do like having a night where 2 player games is the focus. Saturday was meetup. Played a mix of games. Highlight was ending a 2 and half year streak. To clarify, game of the week, doesn't mean the best game. It means the best play of a game in a week. Similarly, dud doesn't mean worse game I played, just one that fell the most flat. Arkham Horror: The Card Game Full campaign, 3 players. We lost badly in the last game, mainly because we struggled to get clues in the 2nd game. VERDICT - While we were playing the first game, I was feeling great about the game. It felt thematic, I felt like my decisions mattered, and we were all having fun. All those things quickly were tore away over the next 2 games. The game became move to location, draw a random token for skill check, move token from one card to another until full. REPEAT. And the longer this went on, the less I was liking it. Worse, the theme of our locations was gone. At one point we were in woods, it could have been in a busy city or on a moon base, and nothing would have felt different or be changed. At the end of the day I enjoyed the game, but I didn't love it. My expectations were huge for this, and I must say it's a big disappointment. LCGs are expensive, and it needed to be love for me to invest. I'm not even sure I liked it more than mansions of madness. The hand management is massively better than the near non existent choices in mansions. However mansions does such a better job pulling you into it's world and making you feel the theme. Each scenario in mansions feels different. Arkham is much bigger pain to set up each game. As it stands, I'm hoping to play the game occasionally if someone else in my group picks it up and collects it. I say it's likely, as the people I was playing with enjoyed it more than me. #Up4Trade Different characters have a different feel Good hand management Cool upgrading your deck between missions Great artwork Feels more mechanical than thematic after a short while Long fiddly set up time Repetitive gameplay Biggest ripoff of the \"core set\" and needing two, of all the LCGs. FFG should be ashamed of themselves for ever defending it as anything other than the blatant cash grab it is, while producing a bunch of useless waste (you throw away over 1/2 the 2nd core).",

And this wireless printer never does what I want it to.\" Yes, it's that time of the year again. Trading turkey for tech advice is a time-honored and always-awful ritual for anyone under the age of 30 who still has parents. This year, Apple has seen the oncoming tide of woe, realized it needs to curry favor with young people to keep iPhones hip, and has launched an app to help.\n\nDON'T MISS:  The best feature of AT&T’s new $35 TV subscription might be illegal \nThe app gives you information about how to use your Apple products (assuming you can install the app in the first place!), schedule appointments at the Apple Store, or live-chat with a support rep. For most situations, and with a little training, it can replace your phone number in your grandparents' book for tech support.\nEven better, it knows what devices you have registered with your Apple account. Rather than having to explain the difference between A1701 and A1702 to someone, you can just ask them to log into the Support app and see documentation.\nThe app is available in most app stores apart from the US store, strangely. Hopefully, it should be rolling out state-side in the next few days, just in time for you to visit home.\nTrending right now: \nThis tiny Wi-Fi router is probably better than yours, and it’s less than $11 9 new movie trailers you need to watch from this past week 11 paid iPhone apps on sale for free for a limited time See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "title": "iPad Pro 2 Release Date And Rumors: 3 Things Apple Can Do To Ensure Its Success",
      "text": "\nBoth the 12.9-inch and the 9.7-inch iPad Pro are due for an upgrade, and their absence in Apple’s recent iPhone and MacBook Pro events appear to signify that the powerful tablets would have a dedicated release just for themselves. With numerous rumors emerging about the iPad Pro 2’s specs and release date, speculations are high that Apple’s next productivity tablets would be the tech giant’s best ones yet.\nThe first two iPad Pros that the company launched were designed to bridge the gap between Apple’s tablet and notebook line. Prior to the iPad Pro, the tech giant’s tablet line was widely considered as devices that are specifically designed for the casual user. While enterprises embraced the iPad, the tablet in itself was not really advertised as an enterprise-grade productivity machine . This changed last Fall when Apple unveiled the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, followed by the 9.7-inch iPad Pro earlier this year.\nThe 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro The 12.9-inch iPad Pro was Apple’s first attempt at creating a new, portable device that is powerful enough to serve as a replacement for full-fledged computers such as the MacBook Air. However, the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s rather unwieldy size, its mobile operating system and the fact that its Keyboard Cover and Apple Pencil were accessories that needed to be separately bought compromised much of the device’s potential. Even after Apple released its smaller sibling, the 9.7-inch iPad Pro, users’ issues about the devices remained largely the same.\nWith the iPad Pro being advertised as a hybrid enterprise-grade device, it is entering a market that is dominated by powerful 2-in-1 machines like the Microsoft Surface Pro , a device that has continually gained a formidable reputation as a portable machine that delivers the best computing experience in the industry. Thus, for the iPad Pro 2 to perform better than its predecessor, it must be able to accomplish a number of very important things.\n[Image by Stephen Lam/ Getty Images] Provide A Real Multitasking Experience One of the biggest gripes of iPad Pro users was the fact that the device simply does not perform very well when it comes to multitasking. While the 12.9-inch iPad Pro introduced the concept of split screen computing for its users, the fact that it could not even display two MS Word documents and an internet browser at the same time crippled its productivity. Numerous fans of the device, including Apple aficionados, remarked that the multitasking features of the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro simply felt too unrefined.\nFor the iPad Pro 2, Apple would be wise to make sure that the upcoming device’s multitasking features would be far smoother than before. Fans of the powerful tablet have suggested a more intuitive multi-application system, which could easily toggle between multiple windows of the same app beside a running application. After all, enterprise users usually deal with multiple Word docs and Excel spreadsheets while taking down notes at the same time. Being able to do this on a system that does not feel incomplete and limited would definitely help.\nProvide A Significant OS Boost While both the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro are devices that were advertised as productivity machines, numerous users have remarked that iOS simply pales in comparison to the robust feature set of Apple’s desktop-grade operating system, MacOS. While the iPad Pro did maximize the utilization of iOS, users of the device have been left wanting. iOS has always been a mobile operating system, and it is perfect for smaller devices like the iPhone. For larger machines like the 12.9-inch iPad Pro, however, numerous fans have remarked that MacOS would simply be a far better fit for the device.\nWhile it would be a long shot to think that Apple would release a MacOS-bred tablet next year, a significant boost to the feature set of iOS would definitely add to the device’s selling points. When the 12.9-inch iPad Pro was released, numerous users immediately noted that several iOS apps simply don’t do justice to the machine’s massive real estate. If the iPad Pro 2 could at least make sure that it does not simply feel like an oversized iPhone but a completely different breed of computer, it might be able to stand toe-to-toe with Microsoft’s Surface line of devices.\n[Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images] Improve The Smart Keyboard And Apple Pencil The iPad Pro’s productivity feature lives and dies with its two primary accessories, the Smart Keyboard and the Apple Pencil. However, both accessories attracted the criticism of numerous users. Numerous fans, for one, have stated that the keys in the Smart Keyboard are simply far inferior to the excellent keys found in the MacBook Air. The lack of a trackpad on the Smart Keyboard was also a source of frustration for many as numerous productivity applications such as MS Excel are best used with a pointing device. As for the Apple Pencil, users have also remarked that the nifty stylus still has a huge area for improvement.\nThus, it would be best if Apple would introduce a revamped Smart Keyboard for the iPad Pro 2. The simple addition of a laptop-grade trackpad and a better set of keys would take the device a long way. Apart from this, an improved Apple Pencil, complete with an eraser function, would also improve the experience of the device significantly.\niPad Pro 2 Conclusions Apple might very well have a winner with the iPad Pro 2. Rumors are high that the next generation of Apple productivity tablets would be far better than their predecessors. Speculations about the device are encouraging, with fans pretty much unanimous in the belief that the entire iPad Pro 2 range would be equipped with the A10 Fusion chip and coupled with at least 4GB of RAM. Storage-wise, the iPad Pro 2 would most likely keep Apple’s 32GB/128GB/256GB options, though a 512GB variant for the 12.9-inch variant is also rumored to be in the works.\nWhile it is certain that Apple would improve upon the 12.9-inch and 9.7-inch iPad Pro, the tech giant might need to step away from its comfort zone in order to ensure that its next breed of productivity tablets reach their utmost potential. With a speculated release date of early to mid-2017, the iPad Pro 2 would need to be in a completely different league than its predecessors. If any, rumors about the device have been very encouraging. Thus, when it comes to the iPad Pro 2, the ball is truly in Apple’s court.\n[Featured Image by Tomohiro Ohsumi/Getty Images]\niPad Pro 2 Release Date And Rumors: 3 Things Apple Can Do To Ensure Its Success is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "\nAccording to MacRumors , Barclays Research analysts claim that Apple will be launching three new iPad Pros in March of next year. The release will include an updated 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch model as well as an all-new bezel-free 10.9-inch model, making it the iPad Pro's largest screen to-date. The 10.9-inch model is rumored to have a borderless design which will allow for it to be the same physical size as the current-generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro, meaning the display itself will need to have an edge-to-edge design, signalling the removal of the Home button. The report also states that all three new iPad Pro models will gain quad microphones, compared to the current dual setup, and retain the 3.5mm headphone jack. The 12.9-inch iPad Pro will house a True Tone display just like in the 9.7-inch version, and is said to gain the same 12-megapixel rear-facing iSight camera. Further updates such as OLED displays are expected in 2018. So far no details on pricing have emerged.\nClick here to view full gallery at Hypebeast.com \n\n",

      "text": "Me and Apple are going through a tough time right now. \nI recently had to buy a replacement Apple TV for a unit that crapped out at 14 months, past its warranty, but long before the expected life span. My MacBook Air – admittedly after over five years of extremely hard use – has reached the point where the battery holds no more than 40 minutes charge and I cannot simultaneously listen to iTunes and use a web browser without the fan sounding like a C130 on takeoff. \nThe blue-shirted Genius at the Apple Store told me my model is too old to qualify for their battery replacement service ($129). I may have growled at the nice young man with the interesting facial hair when I got that news. \nWhen I opened the Apple TV box and the first thing to fall out was the Apple insignia stickers they include with every product, I though, eff that. I am not in the mood to be your brand ambassador. \nI’ve been looking at Chromebooks, since I could buy four of them for the price of a single MacBook Air replacement. \nThat said, has there been a more successful brand of the last decade than Apple? I can’t think of one. \nWhen Apple was flying highest, they met the most important criteria of a successful brand, desirable image, backed by good products, a virtuous circle. Slap one of those stickers on my forehead for all I care. Heck, make it a tattoo. \nBut the Apple brand has encountered some recent turbulence. The Apple Watch is “meh,” and when it comes to the iPhone 7, you’ll have to pry my dedicated headphone jack out of my cold dead hands. \nStill, I’m not worried about Apple’s fortunes. The brand is at least built on something, and a few product missteps can be rectified. \nA potent brand can be so powerful that they take on the outward appearance of an “institution,” but even a successful and enduring corporate institution with a seemingly indestructible brand can collapse if the brand is either irreparably tarnished, or fails to deliver the product or services people want, i.e, Kodak. \nThen there are the truly empty brands that rise and collapse because there was little to nothing behind them but a hope and a wish. Remember Groupon? \nOr how about Theranos, the brainchild of one-time wunderkind CEO Elizabeth Holmes that promised to diagnose disease with a pinprick of blood? \nTheranos went from a $9 billion valuation to almost zero , once it was exposed as essentially fraudulent, a company that did and made nothing. \nTheranos was a brand built on a sales pitch, and when the pitch proved to be hollow, collapse ensued. \n-- \nColleges and universities are brands, but to be successful, they must first be institutions built on enduring substance. Higher education exists not to sell things, but to do things. \nThis is why Harvard remains the most desirable college destination in the country, while Donald Trump is subject to a class action fraud lawsuit for Trump University. \nBut as I argued last week , more and more energy inside our schools is going towards the brand, with less care for the work of the institution. It is now more important to look good than to do good. \nBut long term, institutions only survive by doing. A good brand alone isn’t sufficient protection for institutional collapse. \nMost of our institutions have not become Trump University (an outright scam), but at what point will we cross a line to servicing the brand at the expense of students and learning? \nHas it happened already? \n-- \nPolitical campaigns have always involved branding the candidate and message – Reagan’s “Morning in America,” George W.’s “compassionate conservatism,” Barack Obama’s “Hope,” for example – and those brands gave rise to a kind of sales pitch, but in each previous case, those potent brands and successful pitches have been rooted in coherent underlying philosophies backed by at least somewhat doable governing promises (the politician’s version of product). \nOne of the reasons Donald Trump’s electoral victory may have surprised many is because we (including myself here) thought, that at some level, the presidency, as an institution, would be resistant to a candidate who was all pitch and no product. \nThis thinking was obviously wrong. The presidency can indeed by won [1] on pure, unadulterated sales pitch, otherwise known as B.S. \nI believed that many aspects of the Trump brand were inconsistent with the institution of the presidency. How could boasting of sexually assaulting women, playing coy with white supremacy, outright rejecting core principles of American pluralism, displaying near total ignorance of international affairs, and cozying up to a hostile foreign power not be “disqualifying?” \nPresidents don’t do that stuff, or so many thought. \nIf that wasn’t enough, surely voters would see through the policy promises that were impossible – Mexico paying for a border wall, and the U.S. government rounding up and deporting between 5 and 13 million undocumented immigrants, for example - and reject the candidate. \nThe Clinton campaign’s primary communication strategy was to hammer Trump on his unfitness to the office of the presidency, almost always using his own words. \nAnd it worked. Exit polls show that 63% of voters didn’t think Trump has “the temperament to serve effectively as president.” \nBut one of the reasons Donald Trump is our next president is because 20% of the people who think he’s not capable of being president voted to make him president. \nIn a post-institution age, the pitch is all that matters. I thought that the presidency was one of the few solid institutions remaining that enough people, regardless of circumstance or ideology, would protect it for someone they (63%, remember) believed to be unfit. \nI was wrong. \nWe have gone from candidates making campaign promises – pledges that the candidate will attempt to fulfill [2] - to what Trump confidant Newt Gingrich recently called campaign “devices” while distancing Mr. Trump from his promise to build the Mexican border wall with Mexico’s money. \nThe difference is perhaps subtle, but deeply meaningful. No promise was made, so no promise can be broken. \nThe question now is what happens when we get the product home. Early indications aren’t encouraging. Trump himself seems less than interested in the work of governing, already asking how many nights he can sleep in his Trump Tower penthouse, and suggesting that he mostly wants to continue to do large rallies, though it’s not clear what those rallies would be for, other than to give President Trump something fun to do. \nAll those lingering campaign “devices” leave the nascent Trump administration in something of a bind, having pledged something for everybody. A Michigan voter interviewed by the New York Times voted for Trump to give Washington a “kick in the rear.” At the same time, she doesn’t want to see the Affordable Care Act repealed because her daughter is receiving subsidized care at $50 per month. \nShe indicated that she thought that Donald Trump was “bluffing” about ACA repeal. \nWorkers at a Carrier plant near Indianapolis believe President Trump will save their jobs , rather than see them exported to Mexico. \nThis is not going to happen. \nThe transition team is reportedly having a hard time finding national security staffers who will work in a Trump Administration. The list of possible cabinet members and White House staffers come from so many different political philosophies that it’s difficult to know what will come out of his White House. \nPresident-elect Trump is described by his own people as a tabula rasa on policy, one that sometimes erases himself like an etch-a-sketch, as seen yesterday when he sent out a Tweet denying he’d spoken favorably about nuclear proliferation , even though he’d done so several times. \nOn November 11th, President-elect Trump said we’ll have a “deportation force.” \nNovember 13th, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan said fears of a deportation force are “unfounded.” \nI am deeply distressed by the fact that so many racists and white supremacists and “white nationalists” seem suddenly emboldened by a President Trump, including the one who is going to be one of his “ senior counselors.” \nI am fearful of the potential damage of a Trump Presidency’s policies, particularly when it comes to the rights of the vulnerable. \nBut maybe I’m most worried that Donald Trump stands to break the most important and influential institution we have. \nWhat happens when you elect a sales pitch to run an institution, when you open the box and find nothing inside except the sticker (or hat)? \nWe’re about to find out. Follow @biblioracle \n[1] Albeit with a needle-threading electoral college victory and robust popular vote defeat. \n[2] Studies of these promises show that presidents actually fulfill over 2/3 of the promises they make while campaigning.

      "text": "Apple iPhone 8 update: Both iPhone 8 variants to be larger and bezel-free International Business Times (AU) 1 hr ago Alvin Alcalde © Provided by IBT Australia Apple iPhone 7 Apple is going to make the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus literally bigger than their predecessors, this according to a new report making rounds online. It looks like the tech giant will go all out celebrating its 10th year anniversary of mobile phone domination in 2017.\nApple is planning to launch its future iPhone handsets on new 5-inch and 5.8-inch variants, as told by Barclays Research analysts Jerry Zhang, Blayne Curtis, Thomas O'Malley and Christopher Hemmelgarn via MacRumors . Both the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus are said to feature curved and bezel-free new looks. The analysts said that they got their information from Apple’s supply chain while they were on an Asian tour.\nThe iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus models currently measure 4.7 inches and 5.5 inches respectively. While the report says that the development is not “100 percent locked down” yet, Apple is indeed heading that direction. The iPhone 8 and the iPhone 8 Plus are slated for bigger boosts.\nA number of recent reports suggest that Apple will equip the iPhone 8 Plus with OLED display, which will mark the Cupertino-based company’s first time to use such technology on its flagship smartphone. Compared to LCD screens, OLED displays not only are brighter and sharper, they’re also power savers. Moving forward, Apple will most likely seek the help of the biggest players of the OLED game: Samsung, Sharp and LG.\nThe details of Apple’s latest Securities and Exchange Commission 10-K filing have been leaked just recently and they virtually confirm the tech giant’s intentions regarding its future iPhones. Investment firm J.P. Morgan looked into the documents and saw purchase orders reaching more than a year in duration and amounting to US$4 billion (AU$5.2 billion). The deals are believed to be between Apple and Samsung.\nApple will ultimately have to remove the Home button of the future iPhone 8 to add more space for its display. This will be the only way the flagship phone can achieve an edge-to-edge display. Apple is expected to launch the new iPhone 8 in September next year.\nGo to MSN Home",

The incident was reported by a Chinese website Leikeji . \nAccording to the report, iPhone 7 Plus slipped down from the user’s hand and fell down at a height of approx. 50cm started emitting smoke, and then caught fire. The user had purchased an iPhone 7 Plus after reading the reports of Samsung Galaxy Note 7 explosion. \nIn August, a similar incident was reported in Sidney, Australia. A biker fell off from the bike and noticed that an “incredible plum of smoke” coming from his rear side pocket and he felt “searing pain”, Sidney Morning Herald reported. Apparently, the iPhone had melted in his shorts and got stuck to his skin. He reportedly had to “punch it off”. The biker suffered third-degree burns and had to undergo a skin graft to repair the damage. \nIn September, another iPhone exploded while still in the box. There is no clear-cut information about the models of the phone in the above two cases. \nBesides Apple iPhone, Xiaomi Mi 4i too had caught fire recently. A user had kept it for charging and was using it while charging when the device caught fire. Overall, the instances of smartphone batteries exploding are increasing. \nAlso Read: Google Pixel Hacked In Under 60 Seconds By White-hat Hackers In China \nLithium batteries are volatile and reactive. They are susceptible to catch fire even with a tiny bit of moisture. It can also catch fire due to defective circuitry, overheating, physical damage, or external pressure. Moreover, the batteries of the new smartphones are undergoing massive changes in terms of their size, and consumer’s expectations about battery life. All these factors contribute to the new incidents of explosions, experts claim.",

      "title": "Apple Watch Series 2 Review: The Best Fitness Wearable?",
      "text": "Apple Watch Series 2 Review Apple Watch Series 2 can be worn while swimming It's great for running half marathons Watch Unlock is one of its best features \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 arrives nearly 17 months after the original, and has a few features that its predecessor probably should have shipped with. The first and foremost of these is a snappy and responsive operating system - which is now available on the original Apple Watch too - followed by integrated GPS, and a waterproof enclosure. Series 2 gets all of these plus something that the original Apple Watch might have lacked - a clearly defined target audience. \nThe original Apple Watch did feel like it was trying to please too many people at once. There weren't enough compelling reasons to own one, and that was not good for Apple. Somewhere along the way Apple seems to have realised that the Apple Watch holds tremendous value for those into fitness, and so the company has done well to target this market with Series 2. \nThe second iteration of Apple's wearable has a clear identity - it wants to be the only fitness tracker iPhone users will need. All other reasons to own an Apple Watch Series 2 feel secondary if one considers its headline features - GPS, and the ability to be worn while swimming. This new device will appeals strongly to athletes, and we used it for two weeks while training for a half-marathon to see if it lives up to its billing. Running with Apple Watch Series 2 The Apple Watch Series 2 looks almost exactly like its predecessor; the only difference is that it's a few grams heavier. The increase in weight is negligible and we certainly didn't feel it in our time with the Series 2. The Apple Watch has a premium feel that most running wearables lack. People usually don't want to wear rubberised running watches with formal attire, but the Apple Watch Series 2 won't pose any such problem. It looks just as good with gym wear as it does with formal attire.\nWhen we were ready for our first run, we were surprised to see that the Series 2 started a 3-second countdown as soon as we tapped Start. Most running watches take around 60 seconds to latch on to a GPS signal and some of them cache locations to speed up the process. With Apple Watch Series 2, this is a non-issue. It was ready to log runs instantly, no matter where we were - and that's a big plus. However, there's no indicator on screen to show that GPS is active. We think that could be a useful addition just to assure people that the device is doing what it should. \nWe wore a TomTom Spark on one hand and Apple Watch Series 2 on the other during most of our runs to establish a point of reference. We also did a speed run on a slightly unconventional 340-metre track to measure the distance recorded by the GPS against a mile marker. We didn't compare the results of our first run with the Apple Watch because it uses that for calibration, and then provides more accurate data based on your stride length among other factors. \nThe first test run was for 10km along a lakeside road, with a stretch under trees. The TomTom watch recorded 10.77km in 1:04:00, while the Apple Watch recorded 10.73km in 1:03:40. The small difference in time is because we started recording on the TomTom Spark earlier. If you ignore that, the data is almost identical. Both watches recorded an average heart rate of 180bpm. \nMost of our test runs produced similar results. We noticed a deviation of around 60m (3.66km on Apple Watch against 3.72km on the TomTom Spark) once, but we did pause that run in between and the difference could be attributed to us resuming it on the Spark before the Apple Watch. The test run on the 340m track revealed a bigger difference in the data recorded by the two watches: the Apple Watch logged it as 8.5km in 1:05:00 while the TomTom Spark recorded it as 8.73km in 1:05:10. This was a speed run involving 9 sprints of 200m each and we hit the distance at the same time on both watches. This was the most significant deviation we noted in the data recorded over the two-week period, and it might have crept in during our slow warmup and cool down runs, or in the rest periods between each sprint. \nWe really missed having an always-on display on the Apple Watch Series 2. During speed runs, it's nice to have your run data available at a glance. The TomTom Spark provides this, but with Apple Watch, we had to wait about half a second longer for the display to turn on and show us anything useful. The raise to wake feature works perfectly - it always turns the display on as soon as the watch's screen faces you - but it still is a bit too slow for speed runs. For tempo and long runs, we didn't miss this functionality as much, but in general it's something runners would prefer to have. \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 has a great touchscreen. It's very bright and perfectly legible under sunlight, but we're not convinced about this being the best way to operate a watch while running. When your fingers are sweaty or when you're running in the rain, operating the touchscreen becomes slightly difficult. Thankfully one of the watch's physical buttons lets you pause runs and it even has an auto-pause feature that kicks in when you stop moving. You can sync Apple Music songs to the watch and play them via Bluetooth headphones. \nSo can you leave your iPhone at home during runs? Only if you don't care about elevation data. The Apple Watch Series 2 doesn't have an altimeter so it won't be able to record elevation changes unless you carry your iPhone with you. For serious runners, that's a major omission. \nSoftware and ecosystem The Workouts app could use a few improvements. We found a bug that hides all of your run data if you hit the \"digital crown\" controller and the power button at the same time. After that, run data appears on screen only if you start a new run. The app doesn't let you export your runs to other services either. With the TomTom Spark and competing products from Garmin, you can automatically export run data to multiple services such as Strava and Runkeeper. Workouts also lacks modes for training runs. For instance, you can't configure the app to let you run 2km slowly, followed by a 200m sprint, then 4 minutes of rest, then a 200m sprint, and so on. You can only set goals by calorie count, time, or distance, which is barebones compared to what running watches offer. \nApart from Workouts, Nike+ Run Club is the only app that currently supports GPS on the Apple Watch Series 2, so you'll find yourself restricted to these two choices. RunKeeper is planning an update to add native GPS functionality soon, while Strava and Runtastic users will probably have to wait a bit longer. If Apple allowed you to export data, you could send it to all such services in one go. Most people will have a few running buddies on each platform and this would be a way to share run data with them all. \nThat said, most people who use running watches will definitely appreciate the fact that Apple Watch Series 2 automatically syncs runs with the Activity app on the iPhone. Most low-cost wearables require you to sync data manually, but even the ones that cost upwards of Rs. 30,000 aren't nearly as good as the Apple Watch Series 2 at non-fitness related tasks. \nWith watchOS 3, Apple has finally shipped a relatively fast and stable platform for its smartwatches. We've used watchOS 3 on a first-generation Apple Watch as well as the Series 2, and it's definitely snappier on the latter, which is no surprise give the beefed-up hardware. Apps now open quickly and switching between them is very easy thanks to the Dock. We found ourselves dismissing useless or less important notifications without touching our iPhone. The Scribble feature in Messages helped us draft plenty of quick replies by simply scribbling one character at a time. That's extremely useful when you're in crowded public transport and don't want to pull your iPhone out. \nApps such as Authy let us check two-factor authentication codes on the watch, which was yet another reason not to check our iPhone 7 too often. Calls aside, we found ourselves getting through entire work days without using the iPhone itself. Playing podcasts and music, checking emails, handling messages, and pretty much every task we have in our daily workflow could be done on the Apple Watch or our MacBook Air, which is an impressive achievement for Apple's ecosystem as a whole. watchOS gets a big boost thanks to the number of apps now available, and the fact that most of the apps we used worked well. \nWatch Unlock is the one feature that we absolutely fell in love with. We saw a pop-up on the MacBook asking if we wanted to enable Watch Unlock, and a few clicks later we were able to dispense with our password entirely. Whenever you're near the MacBook while wearing the Apple Watch, it'll automatically unlock the Mac for you. It's as convenient as unlocking an iPhone using Touch ID. The best thing is that all of these new software features work with all iterations of Apple Watch, not just the Series 2 models. \nThe way watchOS 3 arranges icons on its home screen is one thing that feels dated. The circular pattern makes them hard to access and we hope this changes in future versions of watchOS. \nPerformance and verdict One of the biggest improvements to the Apple Watch Series 2 is battery life. Thankfully, GPS doesn't drain too much of the watch's battery. We noticed that hour-long runs usually consumed around 6-8 percent of battery power. The watch easily lasted two days on a single charge and sometimes a little more than that. We never found ourselves worrying about battery life. While we didn't wear the watch during races, we think it should suit those training for full marathons. Anything longer than that and the Apple Watch Series 2's battery life could be a stumbling block. \nIf you're looking for an all-purpose fitness watch to complement your iPhone, Apple Watch Series 2 is exactly what you need. It starts at Rs. 32,900 and is definitely quite expensive for what it offers. You could buy yourself a dedicated runners' wearable such as the TomTom Spark or Garmin Forerunner 235 for less and get better battery life and features for different kinds of training runs, but the tradeoffs would be the loss of automatic syncing and deep integration with your iPhone and other Apple gadgets. If you can live without integrated GPS and don't plan on swimming much, you can go for the revised Apple Watch Series 1, which now starts at Rs. 23,900 and offers good value for those who use an iPhone while exercising.

The PBA launches its own mobile app. Photo by Josh Albelda/Rappler \nMANILA, Philippines – The Philippine Basketball Association ushered in its 42nd season, and a new age of venturing further into digital, with the launch of its own smartphone app, the league announced during the preseason press conference on Monday, November 19 at Makati Shangri-La. \nThe app is already available for free download on Apple's App Store and Android's Google Play. \n\"This app should be a lifestyle, it should be a habit,\" said this season's PBA chair Mikee Romero, who noted the league is eyeing a more interactive approach to connecting with its fans. \nThe app is part of the league's new direction toward reaching out to more of its digital-native millenial fans, as well as tapping into new audiences. \nIt is designed to become the source of all things PBA, from latest news and results to full schedules and standings, as well as team rosters, individual and team stats, and player biographies. \nThere's also a tab for stat leaders and all of the PBA's social media channels – Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram – can be accessed in-app. \nEvents and promos can also be accessed through the app, including the PBA Fantasy Basketball game. \nSome future features that have yet to be launched include PBA Live, where games can be livestreamed, the PBA Store, the PBA Cafe, and a log-in option for users to be able to customize the news and push notifications they receive. \n\"In order for us to quantify or to look at how big the app can be, let's just say for example that there's an existing 5 million watchers of the PBA at any game in the traditional television, this app in two years' time we want to add another 5 million,\" Romero said. \n\"That's the type of app that we're looking at, if just to quantify it. I'm not saying that's the exact number of watchers of the PBA during regular games, but that's the kind of exponential growth that we want for this app.\" \nThe app is part of a number of changes the league is trying out for its 2016-17 season, which includes a potential full All-Star Week played regionally, a possible invitational for Asian club teams, and the removal of the import handicap system for the last two conferences. \n(READ: PBA eyes invitational for Asian teams, removal of import handicapping ) \nThese changes come at the heels of a season in which the PBA was criticized for its low gate attendance, with fans taking to social media to point out empty seats in game photos and suggesting their own ideas and innovations.

By: Tech Desk |   1:28 pm Apple iPhone 8 will mark a big departure in design compared to iPhone 6s, iPhone 7. Representational Image. (Source: AP) \nApple iPhone 7 might have just launched, but rumours around the iPhone 8 are going strong. The latest comes from Barclays Research analysts who say the iPhone 8 will sport a curved, bezel-free design next year in 2017. This is supposed to mark the tenth anniversary of the iPhone; the first iPhone was introduced in 2007 by Steve Jobs, and Apple is expected to go big with the tenth edition device. \nAccording to Barclays Research analysts, whose note was accessed by MacRumors, iPhone 8’s borderless design will mean these phones will sport the same size as the current generation iPhones. However, Apple will introduce a 5-inch and 5.8-inch display version, which is bigger than the current 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus series. The iPhone 8 Plus version will come with an OLED display, and Apple is relying on Samsung and LG, along with Foxconn -owned Sharp for this in 2018. \nEarlier KGI Securities’ Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has spoken about the bigger 5.8-inch OLED display iPhone for 2018. He had said in his note the iPhone 8 will sport a new design and will come in an-glass body. Apple is also expected to remove the Home button in the next version of the device. \nAlso read: Apple iPhone 8 could come with never seen before wireless charging technology: Report \nAnother report in BGR claimed the iPhone 8 will come with wireless charging technology, and that Apple has tied up with Energous for this. According to the report, Apple iPhone 8 will have a receiver inside it, which will connect to a transmitter plugged into wall socket to charge the device. The device will charge wirelessly as long as you’re within 15 feet of the transmitter. \nSo you won’t have to carry a wireless charging pad around with the new iPhone and it will end the need for any cables to charge the device. An earlier report in Japan’s Nikkei said Apple will be launching three versions of the iPhone and the glass body will be developed by Biel and Lens. A Bloomberg report had also hinted how Apple was in talks with Sharp so that the latter could supply OLED screens for the 2018 iPhones. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "iPhone conman sold customers new handsets he scammed from Apple By DavidWOwen | Posted: November 13, 2016 0 COMMENTS SHARES iPhone conman sold customers new handsets he scammed from Apple X \nCopy link to paste in your message / Comments (0) \nA man was handed a 16-month suspended prison sentence for operating a £12,000 warranty scam involving stolen mobile phone sets. \nPervez Ahmed (35), of Kashmir Road, St Matthews , Leicester, defrauded Apple out of the money in a scam running for two-and-a-half years. \nLeicester Crown Court was told he sold on new iPhones sent to him while posing as genuine customers whose phones had been either stolen or broken. \nAhmed was sentenced on Friday after admitting fraud by false representation at an earlier hearing. \nHe also pleaded guilty to handling stolen goods and a third charge of converting criminal property. \nProsecutor Kate Plummer said Ahmed started the scam while running his own business mobile phone repair shop, VK Communications, in Narborough Road , Leicester. \nShe said: \"This was a sophisticated fraud committed over a considerable period of time – from the beginning of 2012 to the middle of 2014.\" \nThe scam worked by Ahmed receiving stolen and broken mobile phones, or buying them at a discounted price. \nHe exploited a loophole in Apple's warranty system whereby customers could check online if their phone was covered by a warranty simply by inputting each handset's unique serial number. \nIf so, Ahmed would return the phones, breaking them beforehand if necessary. Apple would issue a new handset in each case. \nAhmed would then sell on the new phones and make a profit. \nMiss Plummer said: \"This involved a total of 64 hand sets with a total value of £12,000.\" \nThe court was told Apple had no method at the time of knowing if a particular iPhone was stolen or not. \nAhmed was eventually arrested and his home searched after Apple realised the phones had all gone to one of two addresses, including the defendant's home, and reported it to the police. \nMiss Plummer said: \"Police found 13 stolen hand sets and £1,115 in cash. \n\"Officers also seized a mobile phone which was examined and found to contain text messages relating to the buying and selling of mobile phones. \nShe added that no evidence was found of any others being involved in the scam, meaning Ahmed was the sole perpetrator. \nIn mitigation, Naeem Valli said his client started the scam when he and his business fell into financial difficulty. \nHe said: \"In 2012, my client was struggling financially to support his wife and children. \n\"He resorted to complementing his income by buying phones he thought were legitimate on the Gumtree website. \n\"He did not realise the consequences of his decisions. \n\"He comes from a respectable family and is ashamed of his actions. \n\"This was not a crime to fund a lavish lifestyle. It was to support his family.\" \nThe court heard that Ahmed is a man of \"good character\" with no previous convictions and had shown genuine remorse for his crimes. \nMr Valli said he was now selling books on a self-employed basis instead of repairing mobile phones, and had attempted to repay the £12,000 lost to Apple, but the firm had no method for him to do so. \nRecorder William Edis QC sentenced Ahmed to 16-months' imprisonment for each charge, to run concurrently, but suspended for two years. \nHe said: \"This was a sophisticated, carefully planned and longstanding fraud. \n\"I accept that it was not carried out to fund a luxurious lifestyle but was instead to meet your financial obligations. \n\"But that's no excuse.\" \nAhmed was also ordered to carry out 220 hours of unpaid work in the community over 12-months. \nHow much he will have to pay in costs will depend on the result of an upcoming proceeds of crime hearing.

      "text": "Apple iPhones and other U.S. goods could suffer sales hits in China if president-elect Donald Trump goes through with his \"naïve\" plan of slapping a large import tariff on Chinese products, a state-backed newspaper warned on Sunday. \nDuring his election campaign this year, Trump spoke of a 45 percent import tariff on all Chinese goods while failing to outline how it would work. Should any such policy come into effect, China will take a \"tit-for-tat approach\", according to an opinion piece in the Global Times, a newspaper backed by the Communist party. \n\"A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.,\" the Global Times article read. \nApple has not responded to CNBC's request for comment.\nGetty Images Apple iPhone 7 mobile phones being sold. But the Chinese newspaper was is not convinced Trump would go through with his suggestion, calling it \"merely campaign rhetoric\" and questioning its legal validity. U.S. law dictates that presidents can only impose tariffs of no more than 15 percent for a maximum of 150 days on all imports, \nAs an example of earlier tariff-tit-for-tats, the Global Times pointed toward the 35 percent tariffs imposed in 2009 on Chinese tires by outgoing U.S. president Barack Obama. China retaliated with its own tariffs on U.S. car parts and chicken. \n\"Both China and the U.S. suffered losses as a result. From then on, the Obama administration waged no trade war against China. If Trump imposes a 45 percent tariff on Chinese imports, China-U.S. trade will be paralyzed,\" the Global Times said. \nThe opinion piece said Trump was a \"shrewd businessman\" and would not be naïve, but, if he was serious with the policy, it would affect a number of U.S. industries. \n\"The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences. We are very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president,\" the Global Times wrote. \nAmerica's relationship with China is in focus after Trump slammed the world's second-largest economy during his campaign. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Trump spoke over the phone on Sunday. \n\"During the call, the leaders established a clear sense of mutual respect for one another, and President-elect Trump stated that he believes the two leaders will have one of the strongest relationships for both countries moving forward,\" a statement from Trump's presidential transition team said.",

The U.S. dollar strengthened. The price of oil continued to cave. Down by $0.72 to $44.55. Gold fell by another $19. Earlier in the day I reduced my size to small in the asset class. Ag commodities: wheat down $0.02, corn up $0.02, soybeans up $0.011, oats down $0.02. Lumber flat. Bonds got schmeissed, again. The yield on the 10-year U.S. note rose by 7 basis points to 2.14% and the long bond by 6 basis points to 2.94%. Municipals got whalopped. And junk was particularly junky -- let's watch this closely. The iShares iBoxx $ High Yid Corp Bond ETF ( HYG ) down by nearly a beaner to $84.45 (now down $4 in the last two weeks). SPDR Barclays Capital High Yield Bnd ETF ( JNK ) down $0.40. Blackstone/GSO Strategic Credit Fund ( BGB ) (I would still avoid!) down by another $0.09 to $14.42. Banks were the world's fair ... again. Brokerages erupted further and so did the insurance sector. I reduced my life shorts recently and raised my Hartford Financial ( HIG ) long to very large. Autos were strong. (I went down to legends in my shorts a few days ago). Energy stocks did well despite a lower commodity price. Tech and consumer staples (my long Campbell Soup ( CPB ) was disappointing) got hit by trade concerns. Big pharma materially underperformed after yesterday's standout day. But biotech continued to rip led by Allergan ( AGN ) , Merck ( MCK ) and Celgene ( CELG ) . Spec biotech flourished ( Sage ( SAGE ) , Intrexon ( XON ) and others). Old tech led higher by IBM ( IBM ) . Ag equipment continued to surge. I moved to tagends on my Caterpillar ( CAT ) short near $81 only a week ago! I discussed the (T)FANG underperformance throughout the day. Longs Radian ( RDN ) and DuPont ( DD ) at or near year highs. Apple ( AAPL ) got hit amid slowing demand stories. JCPenney ( JCP ) got out of its funk on a retail rally. Nordstrom reported an EPS and sales beat and is trading up $8 on the day! Here are some value added contributions on our site today: 1. Jim \"El Capitan\" Cramer on the compulsion to sell everything . 2. Gary \"The Sun Will Come Out To\" Morrow likes Apple here . I will explain why I am negative in a separate column tomorrow . 3. Tim \"not Judy or Phil\" Collins on a Disney ( DIS ) option strategy before earnings. (I went down to tagends in my short recently). 4. James Passeri on my enemy Valeant ( VRX ) . I did not like the 10Q issued today. 5. The Donald, Melania and Rev Shark are on a honeymoon . Positions: Long HIG large, DD, RDN bonds, SDS, JCP, JWN, M, TGT Short SPY, NFLX small, GM small, F small, DIS small, SBUX small, CAT small, JCP puts, AAPL Position: See above.",

      "text": "The iPhone 7 is a hot new item, but followers of Apple expect the company’s next “supercycle” to take just a year, with the iPhone 8 coming out next fall with some radical new features .\nSandy Villere, co-manager of the Villere Balanced Fund VILLX, +0.39% believes investors are looking at an excellent opportunity to scoop up shares of Skyworks Solutions Inc. SWKS, -1.84% because the stock has nose-dived, as revenue at Apple Inc. AAPL, +0.59% has declined.\nSkyworks derives about 40% of its revenue from Foxconn Technology, which purchases components from Skyworks for use when assembling iPhones for Apple, according to comments made by Skyworks CFO Kris Sennesael during a conference call with analysts on Nov. 3.\nHere’s a two-year chart for the stock, through Nov. 10, showing just how volatile it has been, and its huge decline since July 2015:\nSkyworks Solutions stock has been volatile. Apple’s sales for its fourth fiscal quarter ended Sept. 24 were down 9% from a year earlier, while Skyworks reported a 5.2% decline in its third-quarter sales. The recent trend obviously hasn’t been good for either company, and it remains to be seen how much of a sales bump Apple will get from the iPhone 7, which was rolled out in September.\nBut Villere still pins his hopes for Skyworks on Apple. “The revenue Skyworks is getting on each phone is increasing. As time goes on, your iPhone is going to do more and more and more,” he said in an interview. He also said he expected a massive bump for iPhone sales after the iPhone 8 supercycle begins, hopefully in 2017.\nSkyworks also supplies manufacturers who make Android smartphones. “It is a play on phones in general becoming better all the time,” Villere said.\nVillere & Co. Sandy Villere, co-manager of the Villere Balanced Fund The Villere Balanced Fund is “unique,” according to Villere, because it typically holds only about 30 stocks, with at least 25% of the fund invested in bonds, to provide growth and income, with some downside protection. According to Morningstar, funds in the same category, with stock allocation of 50-70% equity, hold 391 securities on average.\nVillere said he and his colleagues select stocks of “dominant companies that trade at reasonable prices, “usually with a theme.” He likes some bank stocks, because of the expected end of the low-interest-rate cycle. He also thinks “technology stocks will be leaders.”\nTwo more stock picks Villere likes First Hawaiian Inc FHB, -0.31% the holding company for First Hawaiian Bank, which was partially spun off by BNP Paribas SA BNPQY, -2.61% in July. First Hawaiian’s stock trades for 18.4 times the consensus 2017 earnings estimate, among analysts polled by FactSet, and for 1.6 times book value. While those valuations don’t look particularly low, Villiere said the stock is “trading at a discount... since BNP still owns 83% of the bank. Everyone is assuming BNP will continue to sell. So nobody wants to step in now.”\nIn January, after a required six-month waiting period following the initial offering, there can be plenty of pressure on the shares if BNP begins selling heavily. Villere expects major investors will “want to wait until they can get a bigger piece, or wait until selling pressure is out of the way.”\nAnother stock Villere mentioned as being attractive but “off the beaten path,” is Financial Engines Inc. FNGN, -0.49% which is a large registered investment adviser that helps large 401(k) providers select mutual funds. The company’s larger customers include Ford Motor Co. F, +2.85% Comcast Corp. CMCSA, +2.09% Northrop Gumman Corp. NOC, +0.95% and Raytheon Co. RTN, +0.37%\nHere are the top 10 equity holdings of the Villere Balanced Fund, as of Sept. 30:\nCompany Ticker Industry % of portfolio Total return - past 12 months Taser International Inc. TASR, +1.34% Aerospace and Defense 7.8% 43% Financial Engines Inc. FNGN, -0.49% Investment Managers 4.9% -9% 3D Systems Corp.

We are showing sales per share growth, rather than revenue growth, because the per-share numbers reflect any dilution from issuance of additional shares, as well as declines in share counts from buybacks.\nHere’s a quick summary of sell-side analysts’ ratings and price targets for the group, along with First Hawaiian Inc., which is not among the fund’s top 10, but was among the individual stocks Villere mentioned:\nCompany % ’buy’ ratings % neutral ratings % ‘sell’ ratings Closing price - Nov. 10 Consensus price target Implied 12-month upside Taser International Inc. 78% 22% 0% $26.82 $32.14 20% Financial Engines Inc. 83% 17% 0% $30.90 $35.50 15% 3D Systems Corp. 15% 60% 25% $14.06 $14.69 4% Howard Hughes Corp. 100% 0% 0% $106.38 $172.75 62% Kearny Financial Corp. 67% 33% 0% $14.55 $14.67 1% Skyworks Solutions Inc. 68% 24% 0% $75.91 $85.04 12% LKQ Corp. 93% 7% 0% $31.87 $38.64 21% Visa Inc.

But here we see the Villere Balanced Fund beating the S&P 500 this year, and also for 15 years.\nAlso see: These stocks should benefit from a Trump presidency\nMore from MarketWatch Trump drops a big tax clue in debate -- here’s what it means Trump's Surprise Media Event With Bill Clinton Accusers What a Nobel Prize-winning economist has to say about CEO bonuses Related Topics Markets U.S. Stocks Mutual Funds Exchange Traded Funds",

      "text": "  Wir wiederholen uns: Schon der berüchtigte Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo von KGI Securities ging davon aus, dass nächstes Jahr, zum 10-Jahres Jubiläum, ein revolutionäres neues iPhone auf den Markt kommen würde. Mit ihm erwartet sich die ganze Medien- und Analystenlandschaft ein fast randloses Design mit einem größeren Display und zudem nach Meinung einiger erstmals auch ein Design, welches den Home Button und damit den Fingerabdrucksensor unter das Display verlagern könnte. Zudem soll mindestens ein Modell mit seitlich gebogenem OLED-Display im Samsung \"edge-Design\" ausgestattet sein. Auch die Analysten von Barclays, die kürzlich erst ihre Meinung zum Launch neuer iPad-Modelle im März des kommenden Jahres abgegeben haben, erwarten sich ein randloses iPhone-Design im kommenden Jahr. Konkret soll das kleinere Modell statt des 4,7 Zoll Displays ein 5,0 Zoll Display erhalten ohne die Grundfläche des Gehäuses zu erhöhen. Das Plus-Modell wächst ebenfalls um 0,3 Zoll von 5,5 Zoll auf 5,8 Zoll und wird ein seitlich gebogenes OLED-Panel erhalten. Diese Panels sollen sowohl von Samsung als auch LG kommen. 2018 wird dann auch Sharp mit seinen neuen OLED-Fabriken dazu stoßen. Im Gegensatz zur bisherigen Annahme, sieht Barclays allerdings keinen Verzicht auf den traditionellen Home Button, was vielleicht auch den vergleichsweise kleinen Anstieg der Displaydiagonale im Vergleich zu Gerüchten um das nächste Samsung Galaxy S8 erklärt, dessen Display beim Plus-Modell möglicherweise auf ganze 6,2 Zoll anwachsen soll.

      "title": "Apple is preparing to launch a brand new iPad line in March: Analysts",
      "text": "Various analysts are now claiming that Apple will launch three new tablets in March 2017. Two will be refreshes of the existing line-up and the third will be a brand new product.\nAnalysts at Barclays suggest that the three new tablets will come in 9.7-inch, 10.9-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes. Apple currently offers tablets in 7.9-inch, 9.7-inch and 12.9-inch screen sizes, reports The International Business Times .\nThe 9.7-inch iPad: Pro no more \nAnalysts expect Apple to drop the “Pro” from the 9.7-inch iPad lineup and sell it as an entry-level option alongside the 7.9-inch iPad Mini. Since the iPad Mini isn’t expected to be refreshed this year, the new 9.7-inch iPad will be the budget option for 2017. Specs are also expected to be entry-level.\nThe 10.9-inch iPad: The new kid on the block \nThis is a brand new iPad that Apple is expected to launch. Analysts believe that this tablet will feature a bezel-less design, offering the same footprint as the 9.7-inch iPad.

      "text": "Concept of the Apple iPhone 8. It has been over a month since Apple launched its latest flagship smartphones – the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. A recent report suggested that the latest smartphone has become the best selling device in US within a month’s time.\nMeanwhile, there are already speculations being made regarding the company’s future device. With next year’s launch, Apple will be celebrating its tenth-year anniversary and in order to make this occasion special, the company is expected to make some major changes.\nLatest report from Barclays’ analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn suggests that the supposed iPhone 8 will feature a bezel-less design with curved edges on all sides. The analysts claim that the iPhone 8 models will come in the same sizes and that the displays of the smartphone will increase to 5 and 5.9-inches, thanks to the bezel-less design technology.\nThe analysts further stressed on Apple’s shift to OLED display panels which are said to be more battery-efficient and offer a better colour accuracy. The OLED display panels are also reported to allow the iPhone 8 screen to bend at the edges thereby, introducing an all-new, curved-edge design on the sides of the future iPhone.\nThe analysts further suggested that Apple’s 3D Touch will witness a new ‘film-based solution.’\nThere have been numerous leaks regarding the iPhone 8 in the past. One of them even pointed towards how the iPhone 8 will come with an advanced wireless charging technology that will allow users to charge their devices even from 15ft of distance.",

      "title": "1Password Touch Bar, Touch ID launches ahead of MacBook Pro",
      "text": "Reddit \nThe highlight of Apple’s new MacBook Pro is, without a doubt, the new Touch Bar. But that bar itself has one feature that is probably the most significant one of all: Touch ID . Bringing to the MacBook Pro the simplicity and security of a technology that has long been on iPhones and iPads, Touch ID promises even faster authentication, be it for the MacBook itself or for online transactions. And 1Password, one of the first third-party services to take advantage of that, has rolled out support for the feature even before the MacBook Pro starts hitting the shelves. \nAt the expense of the traditional function keys, Apple has introduced a more multi-functional OLED Touch Bar above the keyboard. While the icons and actions shown in the Touch Bar aren’t completely open to customization by the user, macOS app developers can take full advantage of that new space to offer app-specific and context-related shortcuts. \nAt the far right of that bar, however, sits the Touch ID, which alone would have already made the new Touch Bar worth the change. Password managers like 1Password are naturally only too happy to jump aboard the new ship. In the latest version 6.5 of 1Password for the Mac, users simply need to enable Touch ID from the program to let it work its magic. \nOnce the 1Password vault has been opened, the Touch Bard will then give a small window to the user’s protected content. Users can juggle between vaults for home, work, and everything else as well as perform quick actions, like creating a strong, random password. All at the tap of a capacitive button. \n1Password version 6.5 also boasts of a new onboarding process to get new users acquainted with the software and service as a whole. While the update is already rolling out to all Macs, you’ll of course have to wait to get a MacBook Pro to use the Touch Bar and Touch ID features.",

      "text": "The iPhone 7 represented forward move in Apple’s design philosophy of moving towards a minimalist smartphone. This week’s Apple Loop comprises the death of a beloved iPhone’s successor, the MacBook Pro’s first week, Apple’s secret discounts on the next iPhone purchase, comparison of older iPhones versus the iPhone 7, Apple’s competition, Apple Music, Reddit’s delayed reaction to the MacBook Pro, and a new version of Snakes and Ladders for Cupertino.\nNo iPhone SE Successor\nThe iPhone 7 represented forward move in Apple’s design philosophy of moving towards a minimalist smartphone. With this brave new world approaching, there was a question of what happens to the iPhone SE. Introduced in March this year, it can be seen as either a budget iPhone 6S or the ultimate iPhone 5S. Many expected the SE line to be updated in March 2017. But according to Forbes’ Gordon Kelly , Apple seems to think otherwise.\nIt wanted to increase margins on the 2016 iPhone SE as its older components are now selling on a reduced price. This will reduce the risk of cannibalisation that a 2017 iPhone SE could have on sales of the more profitable iPhone 7.\nMoreover, it is well known that Apple is far more interested in profit share than market share; hence these reasons make financial sense from a business perspective.\nAlso, the MacBook Pro has sold almost four times as many units as Microsoft’s Surface Book, nine times as many units as the Asus Chromebook Flip, and ten times the Lenovo Yoga 900. The data comes from Slice Intelligence, who can survey a panel of 4.4 million online shoppers on their purchasing habits and digital receipts. The numbers are backed up by Apple’s reports of record online sales and supply chain reports of increased component orders.\nApple’s Discount for the iPhone\nMoving ahead, one addition to the Apple App Store has caught the attention of users this week, which was the appearance of the iPhone in the ‘refurbished’ section of the online store. This is a result of a strategy that the public saw just over a year ago - the iPhone Upgrade Program .\nThis program had started last year and allowed consumers to buy a new iPhone with twenty-four monthly payments. After one year they are presented with the option to extend the payments for a further twelve months and trade in their handset for the latest device.\nSince the program has been around for quite a while, which means there have been users who would have traded their old devices for new ones. Now they could be stripped for parts or to recycle the materials, but there’s a bigger return by selling these units back to customers with a discount on the list price by around eighty to a hundred dollars which means there’s another chance to bring more users into Apple’s ecosystem.\nThe iPhone 7 Fights the refurbished space\nThere is the iPhone 7 in the store, but on the other hand there are refurbished iPhones with full warranty as well. So what should the consumers choose?\nThe iPhone 7’s design improvements are more than skin deep. The iPhone 7 stronger than the iPhone 6 series (which is prone to bending) because of its use of Series 7000 aluminium, it is water resistant and able to survive for 30 minutes fully submersed, and the home button is now just a non-clickable round disc in the middle of the phone with haptic feedback.\nThen there’s the iPhone SE. The device is an exact replica of the 5s, except the hardware is of the iPhone 6s but missing the 3D touch and a bigger battery.\nThe iPhone 7 is more prone to damage due to its curved edges and slippery finish. But it does come with dual stereo external speakers. An intelligent addition by Apple is amplifying the earpiece to make it work as a second speaker. It is not as powerful as dual front firing speakers on various Android counterparts, but it’s the easily the best external audio an iPhone has ever had.\nThen again the iPhone SE retains one potentially major advantage over its more expensive brother: it retains the 3.5mm headphone jack which the iPhone 7 controversially removed.",

      "text": "Share Save Compared to Apple's Siri, the idea of what Google Now is has been quite vague for most people. While it may seem like it's the Android counterpart of Apple's famous voice assistant Siri, it's a more ambitious take on such feature that attempts to expand beyond the limitations of voice command dependent on the smartphone's software. Despite its availability in both Android and Apple smartphones today, few are aware that such revolutionary feature is present in their smartphones today. So, if you do not have the bucks to purchase the new Google Pixel, here is a tip on how you can easily make the most out of your smartphone with Google Now. Setting It Up First and foremost, you must own a Google account or you must sign in to create one. If you have a Gmail account and uses 'Google' regularly, this will help to better enhance the app's recommendations as they track your preferences and other relevant information. To use Google Now on your Android, simply press and hold the Home Button of your smartphone. It will then open a page that looks like a google home page. On the upper left hand of the page, you'll see a button in a form of three (3) bar lines), simply click on it and you'll see all the configuration options that you need. You can click customize to key in your interests or habits, and settings for the operational configuration of Google Now. Using an iPhone? Just download the app and begin using it as described above. Reading Your Habits- The Pre-emptive Google Now One of the most pleasantly surprising things about Google Now is that it can read your daily habits and routine and synchronize it with the phone's utility apps such as Google's Transit feature, alarm, calendar, and a lot more. Say, for example, you wake up at 6am, ride the train at 7, and get to work by 7:30. When doing this on a regular basis, Google Now's cutting edge algorithm will read your daily habits and provide suggestions to improve your daily lifestyle such as updating the time of arrival of the next train, how many hours it take for you to get from your home to your office, the traffic condition in the roads that you usually take, the weather in your area and others. Hands-free Operation Like the Google Assistant, you can easily configure Google Now to perform thousands of tasks on your smartphone with voice commands. Simply tap the microphone symbol and say \"Ok, Google\" followed by your command. It's that easy. It can also open various apps, even the third-party ones, with just a verbal command. Google Now can also read the text messages for you, plot an appointment in your calendar, remind you of upcoming events, roll a dice for you and so many more. Here is an 'endless' list of voice commands you can easily execute. The sky is your limit! Google Now Vs Google Assistant What are the key differences? Google Now is pre-installed on Androids phones utilizing version 4.1 (Jellybean) and above. As said earlier, iPhone users (requires iPhone 4s or later) can download this app as well. While Google Assistant is an upgraded version of Google Now additional features in the new app includes added interactivity and conversational features – just like Siri. However, the Google Assistant can only be used through Google Pixel, Google Allo Chat app, and Google Home (a voice-activated speaker from Google). To the public, the new Google Assistant isn't too different from its predecessor app . Making the Most Out of Google Now Though the new Google Assistant is without a doubt cooler and more interactive, the fact remains that Google Now remains super useful for users. So, it might be great to skip that marketing gimmick urging you to purchase the new Google Pixel and rather exploit the full benefits of your current smartphone with Google Now. 0 Shares ",

      "title": "MacBook Pro Review Roundup: mixed reviews on performance, potential for Touch Bar",
      "text": "Mashable: Apple will never wins awards for affordability. This 256GB of storage, 8GB of RAM, Core i5 system starts at $1,799 — $300 more than the entry-level, traditional function-key sporting MacBook Pro. There are cheaper Windows 10 systems out there that offer better specs and full touchscreens. A 13-inch Core i7 HP Spectre x360, for instance, lists for $1,149.99 (the Mac offers slightly better graphics, an Intel HD Graphics 550 as opposed to the 520). If, however, you are a Mac fan, this is an excellent upgrade with a fascinating and highly extensible new Touch Bar. TechCrunch: \nThe less celebrated spec bumps are what make the new Pro a worthy upgrade, particularly for those who, like me, have been suffering through their old system’s death rattles (or fan buzzing, at least), waiting for a significant update from the company. Better processors, more storage, a brighter display and better speakers are all wrapped up in a sleeker and lighter package than before… The Touch Bar feels like a nice bonus for the time being. It’s a compelling new input device that has the potential to alter the way we interact with applications on a laptop. CNET : But for the other 95 percent of the laptop market, the MacBook Pro remains a compelling choice. It’s far and away Apple’s most-advanced laptop. The touchpad has double the surface area of the previous model, it’s about as light as a MacBook Air but much thinner (14.9mm versus 18mm), and the flatter butterfly style keyboard has been subtly tweaked to work better here than it does in the 12-inch MacBook. Engadget: Touch ID and a thinner design are nice, but give me back my ports. (And my Function keys.)… I’m one of many Mac owners out there who has been waiting for Apple to upgrade the MacBook Pro line. Now that it finally has, I find the new laptop isn’t quite what I wanted. For me, the ideal MacBook Pro is actually a mashup between this and last year’s model.",

      "text": "Apple’s NFC restriction hits mobile payments innovation, Australian banks claim By Rian Boden   13:00 • Last updated 14 November 2016, 13:00 ACCESS RIGHTS: Restricting iPhone NFC functionality ‘hits mobile wallet app investment’ \nThe group of Australian banks taking on Apple over access to the NFC technology within iPhone handsets says the restriction is not only preventing the introduction of mobile wallet services across multiple platforms but also proving detrimental to continued investment into mobile payment apps. \nIn a 27-page submission to the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) this week, the four banks insist Apple’s restriction is fragmenting the customer experience and, without access, there “simply will not be the same incentives and ability to innovative” on either the iPhone platform or other alternatives. \n“In Australia, approximately 40% of smartphone sales are iPhones,” the banks say . “However, the value and importance of the iPhone customer segment for app uptake, use and expenditure far outweigh this share. ‘More engaged’ \n“For example, iPhone users account for 60% of mobile banking transactions and 70% of mobile application revenues in Australia. The tendency of iPhone users to embrace mobile payments, engage in mobile applications and adopt new technologies is particularly important in relation to technology such as mobile wallets. \n“The average iPhone user is more likely to adopt and value the ability to make integrated mobile payments as well as influence a more widespread adoption of this technology. iPhone users tend to be wealthier and likely to conduct more and undertake larger transactions. They are also more engaged and attached to their mobile devices than Android users.” \n“Apple’s insistence on exclusive access to NFC functionality prevents mobile wallet providers from multi-homing — that is, making their apps available on multiple platforms — in turn preventing them from reaching the smartphone users they need to make continued investment in these apps worthwhile,” the banks add. ‘Fewer incentives’ \n“Further, without access to the iPhone’s NFC functionality, there simply will not be the same incentives and ability to innovate for the benefit of Australian customers on either the iPhone platforms or other platforms.”",

      "title": "MacBook Pro with Touch Bar review: The best bits of iOS in a really great Mac",
      "text": "Executive Editor,  01 AM \nApple gave its new MacBook Pro a thinner, sleeker case, which required a new, lower-travel keyboard, a new venting system, even a smaller battery. But while I appreciate a Mac that’s smaller and lighter, since I am carrying it around, I’d rather have a Mac that’s easier or just more fun to actually use. These 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pros with Apple’s new Touch Bar are both. \nThe Touch Bar brings my favorite things about the software keyboard on the iPad Pro to the Mac. The amount of useful shortcuts it adds is ridiculous, and this is before most third-party developers have even had a chance to add support. Even for a premium price—and these Macs aren’t cheap—I think the Touch Bar makes this a much more compelling buy than the MacBook Pro with function keys . Meet the Touch Bar \nIt’s an OLED strip that’s tempting to call a display, but Apple wants developers and users alike to think of it as an input device, not a display. You can’t adjust its brightness yourself, for example, because if it was too bright it would start looking more like a display than a set of keys. It’s also optimized for viewing at a 45-degree angle, looking down from above, which is odd for any screen, but the Touch Bar stays visible and legible even if you are sitting at an off-angle to your Mac. Adam Patrick Murray \nThe Touch Bar is designed to blend in and look like keys, not a bright, glowing display. \nThe Touch Bar is incredibly handy not only because its controls change to match the app you’re using, but also because it’s so customizable. Visit System Preferences > Keyboard, and you can choose what happens when you press the Fn key. The default is showing the function keys: F1, F2, and so on. But if you never use those keys, you could also have the Fn key expand the Control Strip to full size. \nThe Control Strip is a set of four of your favorite keys, and it stays on the right side of the Touch Bar all the time. You can choose which four buttons you want in System Preferences > Keyboard, by clicking Control Strip. That will display a grid of buttons on your screen, and then you use the MacBook Pro’s giant trackpad to drag them from the screen right onto the Touch Bar. The default set of Control Strip keys is brightness, volume, mute, and Siri, but you can select from tons of useful shortcuts, like a button to take a screenshot, start dictation, open Notification Center, or put your Mac to sleep. Adam Patrick Murray \nI customized my Control Strip to have volume, brightness, a screenshot button, and Siri. \nSure, you could use keyboard shortcuts and hot corners to do these things instead, but having them on the Touch Bar is better, in my opinion. The Control Strip has room for four buttons, and you can tap an arrow to expand it to the full set of controls that once lived on the row of function keys (screen brightness, Mission Control, Launchpad, keyboard backlighting, iTunes controls, volume controls). \nThe Escape key, which is no longer a real physical key, hangs out on the left side of the Touch Bar almost all the time. The only time it goes way is when you expand the Control Strip to its full length, but when that happens, an X button shows up where you’d expect Escape to be, and tapping X shrinks the Control Strip again to reveal the Escape key. Keyboard shortcuts that use Escape still work (like Command-Option-Escape, to force-quit an app), but if you’re concerned that the Touch Bar itself could freeze up and prevent that, you could always remap Escape to a different physical key . I’m not going to bother, because in my time with the Touch Bar, it’s worked perfectly. Using the Touch Bar in apps \nAlong with the Escape key and the Control Strip, the Touch Bar holds app-specific controls in the center, and that’s where the real magic happens. This is just a short list of the ways the Touch Bar delighted in me in each app. \nIn Mail, the Touch Bar makes sorting the inbox fast and easy, with buttons for flag, archive, and delete, as well as a button that guesses where you might want to file each message. \nIn Safari, when a video starts playing, a pause button and scrub bar appear on the Touch Bar. Tapping that pause button is a much quicker way to shut the video up than having to find the cursor onscreen, then find the video and often hover over it to get the player’s pause button to appear. Adam Patrick Murray \nHow cool is that?! \nAlso in Safari, when you select the Location bar to type in a new URL or search, the Touch Bar fills with favicons for your favorite sites. The first time I saw the Macworld logo on the Touch Bar, I giggled out loud. \nWhen filling out forms in Safari, QuickType suggestions on the Touch Bar will pop up with your name, address, phone, and email when you tab to those fields. \nIn Messages and Mail, the emoji picker gets a button on the Touch Bar. Tap it and you can scroll through all the emoji or jump to a certain category. It’s faster than pressing Command-Control-Space and then using the Character picker to find and click emoji with the trackpad. Adam Patrick Murray \nThe new MacBook Pros will speed up your emoji workflow considerably. \nIn Calendar, if you select an appointment that someone else invited you to, there’s a button on the Touch Bar to send that person a message. \nIf I’m trying to navigate with mostly the keyboard, dialog boxes can sometimes pull me out. Now, the options in a dialog box also show up on the Touch Bar. \nI also love how the Control Strip’s volume and brightness controls are a single button, and not two buttons (one to increase, one to decrease) like on a function key Mac. You just tap the button to see a slider, and you can even tap and keep your finger down to slide up or down, even if your finger isn’t directly on top of the slider. A smooth slider makes more sense than having to tap-tap-tap a single key to crank the music or brighten your screen. \nMostly, the Touch Bar just adds a new level of surprise and dare I say delight to using a Mac. It’s a bigger deal to me than Sierra’s addition of Siri, because while talking to my computer in the middle of my office isn’t something I’m comfortable doing, using the Touch Bar isn’t a stretch at all. My hands are already on the keyboard, and my eyes are already on the screen, so the Touch Bar is in a great spot for my eyes to flick down while my fingers reach up. Tapping a button on the Touch Bar takes less movement than reaching down to the trackpad to click that same button onscreen. Sure, keyboard shortcuts are even faster, but I don’t remember keyboard shortcuts for even a fraction of the buttons I see on the Touch Bar. Adam Patrick Murray \nThe Touch Bar can speed up surfing in Safari. \nThird-party developers are adding Touch Bar support too. Apple says that Microsoft Office, Photoshop, Pixelmator, the Omni Group’s apps, djay, and many more apps will be updated to support the Touch Bar. Some apps have limited support without an update—I’m typing this in Byword 2.7 , which doesn’t have official support as of this writing, but the Touch Bar is showing me the same QuickType options and emoji picker that I enjoy in apps like Messages and TextEdit. If I select some text, I get the same formatting controls in the Touch Bar as I would in Mail or Pages. I’ll take it. \nSpeaking of QuickType suggestions, this is one area where the Touch Bar falls flat. I type about 80 words a minute, and suggestions just can’t keep up with that, lagging as far as two words behind my fingers. While I’m in the midst of typing a sentence, the words tend to freeze up and only change when I stop typing. But the suggestions can be useful if you’re a hunt-and-peck typer, or you’re, say, holding a sandwich in one hand while one-finger typing with the other. (Hey, a lot of us eat lunch at our desks.) Adam Patrick Murray \nThe Touch Bar makes choosing colors so easy, I might start color-coding my note-taking just for fun. \nI love being able to customize the Touch Bar. Check the View menu of the Finder and all your Apple apps (except, frustratingly, iTunes) for an option to Customize Touch Bar, and then you can rearrange the buttons on the Touch Bar itself, or use the trackpad to drag new buttons from an onscreen menu right off the bottom of your display, where they drop down onto the Touch Bar. It’s a cool effect, and fairly intuitive even the first time. \nThe Touch Bar also has Touch ID, which lets you log into your Mac, authenticate Apple Pay transactions in Safari, and authorize purchases in the iTunes and App Stores without having to type your password. I also love being able to use Touch ID in System Preferences, instead of typing my Mac’s password. Developers can use Touch ID too— 1Password already added support, letting you unlock your password vault with Touch ID, just like you can on iPhones and iPads with Touch ID. \nYou have to click a Touch ID button in 1Password’s login screen to be able to unlock your vault with Touch ID, but it’s much faster than typing in a complex password. \nBut overall, it’s just really cool to have contextual controls on top of the keyboard— I praised the 12.9-inch iPad Pro’s software keyboard on the first day I got it because it had so much real estate that it was able to include extra buttons and controls. Ditching the function keys on the MacBook Pro gave Apple that extra real estate to bring the best parts of iOS—the freedom to put buttons where they’re most useful, when they’re most useful—to the Mac. Performance \nLet’s not forget that there are computers attached to these Touch Bars. In my earlier review of the 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys , benchmarks showed only a slight improvement in CPU speed over the previous generation, but much better graphics performance. These MacBook Pros did a little better. Adam Patrick Murray \nApple supplied us with stock, entry-level models of the 13-inch and 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar. The 13-inch has a 2.9GHz dual-core Intel Core i5, 8GB of 2133MHz RAM, Intel Iris Graphics 550, and 256GB of storage. The 15-inch model has a 2.6GHz quad-core Intel Core i7, 16GB of 2133MHz RAM, Radeon Pro 450 graphics with 2GB of memory, and 256GB of storage. We also had a stock model of the 13-incher with function keys, which makes comparing them across the line pretty easy. \nIn Geekbench 4.0.1, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar scored 3927 in the single-core 64-bit CPU test, which is 5.3 percent faster than the previous generation’s score, and 4.2 percent faster than the just-released 13-inch 2GHz MacBook Pro with function keys. The 15-inch MacBook Pro scored 4216, which is just 1.5 percent better than 2015’s 15-inch MacBook Pro with 2.5GHz quad-core Core i7 with 16GB of RAM and a discrete AMD Radeon R9 M370X. \nGeekbench 4.0.1, single-core CPU test. Longer bars are better. The top three are this year’s Macs, and the bottom three are last year’s. Click to enlarge. \nIn the multicore CPU test, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar bested last year’s 13-inch Pro by 7.9 percent, and this year’s function key model by 3.8 percent. The 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar was was actually edged out by last year’s version in this test. \nGeekbench 4.0.1, multicore CPU test. Longer bars are better. The top three are this year’s Macs, and the bottom three are last year’s. Click to enlarge. \nIn Geekbench’s OpenCL test, the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar scored 30826, using the Intel Iris Graphics 550—that’s 59 percent better than the last generation. The 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys has Intel Graphics 540, and so this Touch Bar model scored 8.6 percent better. \nThe 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar scored 42827 in Geekbench’s OpenCL test when using the AMD Radeon Pro 450 graphics, which is 38.7 percent better than the last gen. This model has 2GB of dedicated graphics memory, but you can upgrade to a Radeon Pro 460 with 4GB of memory for $200. The 15-inch MacBook Pro also contains an Intel HD Graphics 530 chip that can be used to extend battery life during less-intensive tasks. \nGeekbench 4.0.1, OpenCL benchmark. Longer bars are better. The top three are this year’s Macs, and the bottom three are last year’s. Click to enlarge. \nUsing Cinebench’s OpenGL benchmark to further test the graphics, the 13-inch MacBook Pro achieved 36.8 frames per second, which is 27.5 percent faster than 2015’s entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro, and 9.4 percent faster than this year’s 13-inch MacBook Pro with function keys. The 15-inch MacBook Pro scored a whopping 70.4 frames per second, which is 13.7 percent faster than the last generation. \nCinebench R15, OpenGL test. Longer bars are better. The top three are this year’s Macs, and the bottom three are last year’s. Click to enlarge. \nSo does this mean the 15-inch Mac powerful enough for pro video editors, even with a maximum of 16GB of RAM? Probably. There’s a chance Apple will increase the RAM to 32GB next year if it updates the MacBook Pro line to Intel’s next-gen Kaby Lake processors, but even now, one professional video editor who uses Final Cut Pro finds the MacBook Pro “buttery smooth.” It’s worth noting that the 15-inch MacBook Pro can drive two 5K external displays, plus the 2880x1800 built-in display, and still have ports for two external Thunderbolt RAID arrays. Redesign pros and cons \nThe redesigned bodies of both models are thinner and lighter than the MacBook Pros they replace, but there are tradeoffs to achieve this svelter size. The low-travel keyboards use Apple’s new butterfly mechanism. This keeps the nicely sized keys from wobbling if you strike them off-center, but I much prefer having more travel, like on the last generation of MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air line, and I’d be willing to carry a thicker laptop to keep that style of keyboard. (It’s a personal preference, of course.) Adam Patrick Murray \nNo one should be surprised that Apple chose to make its MacBook Pros smaller and lighter. \nAnother quirk is the fan vents on the bottom, one on either side. They feel almost sharp if you happen to run your finger across them, and since they’re on the bottom of the machine, I’d worry about getting water in them if I happened to spill on the desk but not on the computer itself. \nOh, and the Apple logo doesn’t light up anymore, just like on the 12-inch MacBook. That’s a bit of a bummer. Adam Patrick Murray \nOnce enough people upgrade, I'll miss seeing a sea of lit-up Apple logos in the live-streams of tech events. \nWhat isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. Adam Patrick Murray \nWhile I miss the last generation's keyboard, the giant Force Touch trackpads on the new MacBook Pros are a big improvement. \nBattery life is also solid, with both models lasting a full day of heavy use, with multiple apps open, dozens of Safari tabs, streaming music to Spotify, and occasionally indulging in some video viewing with Sierra’s picture-in-picture feature. More detailed battery testing will come in a separate article. Bottom line \nThese new MacBook Pros have a lot going for them. Their biggest weakness, across the whole Touch Bar line, is price. The 13-inch model I tested is $1799 without any upgrades, and the 15-inch is $2399. Going to 512GB of storage is $200 extra, and 1TB is $600 extra, which also seems like a lot. (To compare, last year’s 15-inch MacBook Pro with a discrete AMD graphics chip started at $2499, but that included 512GB of storage.) \nThese prices could come down a little bit next generation, but if you need a MacBook Pro right now, the late 2016 models are solid performers. If I were buying one for myself, I’d go with the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar and max out the storage, although the 15-inch model is even better. Related:",

      "text": "Higher-end models of Apple's MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo's Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who've grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. [...] how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? [...] when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. When you're using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites . The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. [...] the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what's found on mobile devices. [...] the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer.",

      "text": "FBI continues to debate sharing iPhone hack with Apple (w/video) 7 Months Ago \n\"I think you guys are being played,'' she told commissioners Mike Moore, Mike Wells Jr. and Jack Mariano. \"You're being played by a very savvy industry.'' \nStarkey's pointed commentary came during a 100-minute debate last week as commissioners wrestled yet again with an industry-requested proposal to lift the county's 17-year ban on new billboards. Doing so would allow billboard owners to swap some of their static signs for new, illuminated digital boards with rotating messages. \nBut, after two public workshops and two public hearings, a commission majority decided they hadn't heard enough. On a 3-2 vote, the commission delayed the matter until mid January, effectively cutting departing Commissioner Ted Schrader out of the final decision. \n\"I don't see any movement on their part,'' Schrader said of the billboard industry. \"I'm comfortable with passing this today. Quite frankly, they want something that I'm not willing to give to them.'' \nCommissioner-elect Ron Oakley, who will replace Schrader as the District 1 board member, assumes office Nov. 29. He sat through the initial public hearing in October. \n\"If you gave up five (for one digital), you're talking about going from 33 (on Interstate 75) to six or seven. You know that looks better, but I'm not sure of the numbers,'' Oakley told the Tampa Bay Times after the commission meeting. \nThe hearing turned into a public negotiation between Tom O'Neil of Clear Channel Outdoors and the commission over the number billboards to come down in a swap for new digital boards and how frequently the electronic messages could be rotated. An early version of the proposed ordinance called for removing 14 billboard structures for each new digital sign, but the county staff previously acknowledged that the figure was too high. \nLast week, the county considered a revised proposal calling for a 10-for-1 swap based on square footage of the signs, rather than billboard structures or sign faces. For instance, a new 672-square-foot digital sign would require a company to take down 6,720 square feet of existing signs. The proposed ordinance would allow the digital messages to rotate every 30 seconds. \nIndustry representatives, however, panned a square-footage formula — after advocating for it at the prior hearing — and made a counter offer of a 5-for-1 sign-removal ratio, with digital messages rotating every eight seconds. They also objected to putting the digital signs strictly on state roads, which would exclude new billboards from high-traffic county roads in the affluent Trinity area. \n\"They're telling us what their company will do. That's backwards. We're not invested in outdoor media. We're here to do what's right for our citizens,'' Starkey told her fellow commissioners. \nStarkey, as a private citizen, was instrumental in lobbying commissioners for the billboard ban in 1999. During the hearing, she and Schrader offered an 8-for-1 swap, and Starkey later suggested 7-for-1 without gaining a concession. A representative of Outfront Media, the largest provider of billboards in Pasco County, said he had not been authorized by his company to go beyond a 5-for-1 swap. \nAccording to updated numbers presented at the meeting, the county has 509 billboard structures holding at least 1,018 advertising signs. On state roads, the inventory varies from 133 billboard structures along U.S. 19 to 33 along Interstate 75. Combined, there are 343 billboard structures on those roads plus State Roads 52 and 54, U.S. 41 and N Dale Mabry Highway, accounting for nearly 172,000 square feet of advertising space. \nRegardless of the eventual outcome, the county will not be rid of static billboards because of the sheer volume of outdoor advertising around Pasco. \n\"We will always have static billboards,'' said Senior Assistant County Attorney Elizabeth Blair. \"That is the realty of the situation.''

      "text": "– A + Review Review: Apple's late-2016 15\" MacBook Pro with Touch Bar By Daniel Eran Dilger \nMonday, November 14, 2016, 05:02 am PT (08:02 am ET) \nApple's new Late 2016 15-inch MacBook Pro is the lightest and thinnest MacBook Pro ever, but unlike the company's earlier ultralight MacBook Air, it packs a fast, quad-core Intel CPU and a dedicated AMD Radeon Pro GPU along with 16GB of high speed RAM and other \"pro\" level niceties. After spending some time with the new flagship, AppleInsider came away impressed at what Apple was able to achieve.\n\n\n\n\nThe new high end Mac notebook delivers six major categories of enhancements over previous models, beyond its new thinner, lighter frame:\n\nThe new Touch Bar , a dynamic input device that replaces the top row of static F-keys above the keyboard, offering quick access to Control Strip buttons, QuickType keyboard (and emoji) suggestions and contextually relevant app-specific controls that change based on the selected context\nFast Intel quad core Core i7 Skylake CPU options paired with very fast 2133 MHz PC3-17000 LPDDR3 SDRAM and a AMD Radeon Pro 450/455/460 dedicated GPU backed by 2 or 4GB of GDDR5 memory and automatic switching to a more power efficient Intel HD Graphics 530 GPU\nUltra fast PCIe-based SSD storage of up to 2TB\nFour versatile USB-C expansion ports that support up to two 5k or four 4k external DisplayPort monitors (as well as VGA, HDMI and Thunderbolt 2 displays with an adapter cable) as well as USB 3.1 Gen 2 devices (up to 10Gbps) and daisy-chained Thunderbolt 3 peripherals (up to 40 Gbps) and power charging\nA new Wide Color Retina Display that's brighter and sports higher contrast and the expanded DPI P3 color gamut and new louder new stereo speakers\nA larger Force Touch trackpad and enhanced Retina MacBook style butterfly keyboard \n\n\n\n\n\nHow the 15-inch MacBook Pro fits into Apple's Late 2016 notebook offerings \n\nThe latest MacBook Pro models are internally Apple's 13th generation MacBook Pro, but they effectively represent the fourth major body redesign. Steve Jobs introduced the first MacBook Pros at the start of 2006 as an Intel-based version of its existing aluminum shell PowerBooks, one year before the iPhone was introduced. Apple originally introduced just the 15-inch model, followed by a huge 17-inch version and smaller 13-inch model over the next year. \n\nA year after iPhone, Apple introduced MacBook Air at the beginning of 2008, the first unibody Mac design. Later that same year, the MacBook Pro line also got unibody frames. Four years later, Apple discontinued its 17-inch model and moved its MacBook Pro line to Retina Displays, representing the third major redesign. While borrowing manufacturing technology from the MacBook Air and iPad, MacBook Pro models remained a substantial 0.71 inches (18 mm) thick and the 15 inch model weighed in at 4.5 lbs (2.04 kg).\n\nIn its fourth major redesign, the new 15-inch workhorse MacBook Pro slims down to 0.61 inches (15.5 mm) and now weighs just 4.02 pounds (1.83 kg). That's slightly thinner than last year's 13-inch MacBook Air and only a pound heavier, despite packing a broad range of Pro features and essentially a larger, better, faster everything. That really reinforces that Apple's design intent on the Pro end was to create a truly mobile machine more than just a transportable desktop alternative.\n\n\n\n\nApple's high end 15-inch MacBook Pro is available in standard Silver and a darker Space Gray finish, and is sold alongside a smaller 13-inch version with many of the same features apart from scaled down CPU options and being limited to Intel Iris Graphics and 1TB of SSD storage. Apple also offers an entry version of the 13 inch MacBook Pro lacking a Touch Bar and Touch ID and equipped with only two Thunderbolt 3 ports. \n\nThe company is also selling its ultralight 12-inch Retina MacBook powered by lower-end CPUs and with only a single USB-C (supporting only USB 3) in Silver, Space Gray, Gold and Rose Gold; it also continues to sell the former 13-inch MacBook Air , which lacks a Retina Display and uses full size USB 3 ports and Thunderbolt 2, available in Silver.\n\nWhat's new #1: Touch Bar and Touch ID on the Mac \n\nWhile Apple emphasized the light, slim design of the new MacBook Pros at their introduction, it focused even more attention on an entirely new feature making its debut the Mac platform: the new Touch Bar and its Touch ID fingerprint sensor that takes the place of the power button. Both are controlled by a custom Apple T1 chip that pairs the efficient processor used in the Series 2 Apple Watch and Apple's Secure Enclave architecture that authenticates biometric data from modern iOS devices' Home buttons. \n\nTouch ID on the Mac, therefore, takes biometric security a lot more seriously than previous generations of Windows laptops that incorporated a fingerprint scanner. As with iOS devices, the Secure Enclave makes it impossible for third party apps or even system-compromising malware to gain any access to your fingerprint data. \n\nAs implemented on MacBook Pros, the Touch ID sensor (below, the dark square to the right of the Siri Touch Bar button) acts as a button, but you probably won't need to use it as a button very often. The new machines automatically boot up or wake when opened (and don't even bother to play a startup chime). The button is there to perform an emergency power down in the case of a system crash. \n\n\n\n\nUnlike previous MacBook power buttons, pushing it no longer offers to sleep, shutdown or log out of the machine. Just close the lid to sleep. Rather than regularly logging out or shutting down, you can now associate the sensor with five different fingerprints (your own, or of other people), which can be used to wake or to switch between accounts using Fast User Switching. \n\nNote that if you log out of your account, you'll need to supply a password to log back in; Touch ID only works if your account is active. You also need to log in manually after a power cycle, just as with iOS devices. This multiple-account, multiple fingerprint behavior is likely to eventually make it to iOS devices, as they become more powerful and as multiple accounts evolve into a complete feature. So far, Apple has focused on multiple accounts only for education use.\n\nTouch ID can also be used to instantly unlock Notes you've locked with a password, or other content in third party apps making use of Apple's security Touch ID APIs. Apple indicates that locked System Preferences can also be unlocked with a finger print, but that doesn't seem to be working yet. If you have your machine set up to lock the screen after a moment of inactivity (the default behavior), you can also unlock the screen instantly with a touch. It's really, really fast and effortless.\n\nTo the left of Touch ID, the rest of the F-key strip is taken over by Touch Bar , a 2170 pixel by 60 pixel touchscreen display designed to function as an input device. Like the main display, it reproduces the Wide Color DCI-P3 gamut with Retina resolution, and it's optimized for typical viewing at a 45 degree angle. Apple has devoted a lot of thought into how the Touch Bar should work, as detailed in its macOS Human Interface Guidelines \n\nThe Touch Bar is intended to appear and function as a dynamic strip of virtual keyboard keys, unconfined by the physical structure of mechanical keys. When you hold down the FN key, the Touch Bar reverts to a standard strip of 12 function keys and the ESC key (below). If you boot into Windows, the Touch Bar reverts to displaying virtual FN keys. \n\n\nFunction keys are the least interesting thing the Touch Bar can do \n\nOtherwise, the strip displays three pools of functionality: on the right end is a Control Strip of keys offering a mix of conventional alternative MacBook function keys (system volume, media playback, screen and keyboard illumination brightness, Exposé buttons and a button to invoke Siri). This strip collapses down to about a quarter of the Touch Bar in normal use, but a tap on the expansion arrow makes the Control Strip take over the entire Touch Bar (below). You revert back by tapping the close \"X\" button. \n\n\nControl Strip, expanded to take over the entire Touch Bar \n\nThe main portion of the Touch Bar is used by the current application to offer relevant options based on what you're doing or what you've selected. This app region commonly exposes the same kinds of buttons that you'd see in your window Toolbar (like the Mail app, below), but developers can add new controls including sliders, pickers and suggestions that wouldn't really make sense in a window Toolbar.\n\n\nMail puts common Tool Bar icons in the Touch Bar, but also a handy folder Move to control \n\nIt also serves as a way to expose functionality that would otherwise be buried in menus, requiring more mousing around to select. The layout of these app region buttons can commonly be edited from an app's View menu, using an interface similar to how you'd customize your Toolbar buttons (below: editing the Finder's Touch Bar). You simply drag the icons you want toward the Touch Bar on the main screen, and when finished tap the Done button.\n\n\n\n\nEditing the Touch Bar within the Finder app \n\nAnother feature of the Touch Bar —which generally takes over the app region when you're typing —is similar to the QuickType keyboard of iOS. It offers completion suggestions on words you type (below, \"antidisestablishmentarianism\"), and is tied into the standard spell checking of macOS, enabling you to select a spelling suggestion by visually tapping on the word you intended, rather than tapping the space bar to accept the primary suggestion (which in this case would have been \"antics\"). \n\n\n\n\nThis region can also suggest emojis as you type words (or, below, provide a browsable list of your frequently used emojis or present all the various buckets of emojis: smileys, animals, food, activity, places, objects, symbols, flags). The Touch Bar pickers are all much easier to use than the clumsy, existing emoji selection mechanism of macOS that relies on keyboard shortcuts and mousing around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdditionally, whenever you have a selection of options in a dialog box, those buttons generally show up in the Touch Bar for easy selection (below). Also —borrowing a page from iOS —macOS now suggests autofill information in web forms (such as suggesting your phone number, email or other contact information), and these suggestions similarly appear in the Touch Bar as buttons you can use when filling in forms.\n\n\n\n\nUsing the Touch Bar feels novel and futuristic (think Star Trek and those glass command panels of graphics moving around). The options displayed can range from very handy to a bit overwhelming, particularly when you switch to a less familiar app and have to absorb the options it chooses to expose. There's no System Preference for turning off the Touch Bar, but it doesn't ever seem to really get distracting, even if you're inside an app where it makes less sense to use it. If the constantly changing nature of contextual buttons in the app region gets overwhelming, you can tap to expand the Control Strip and have a fixed set of static black and white buttons. \n\nAnd despite a report to the contrary, modifier key combinations (such as holding down Option + Shift when adjusting the volume buttons to change the setting in smaller increments) also work with the expanded Control Strip buttons in the new Touch Bar. However, without expanding the Control Strip, volume controls hide behind a single button, which when touched presents a slider control for adjusting the volume, with standard increment buttons on either end. \n\nWhen background music is playing in iTunes (or another app is playing video or audio), the Touch Bar presents a button that when tapped shows a progress indicator and pause, fast forward and review buttons. There's also a red button badged with the currently playing app, which can be used to bring that app forward (below). Notably, there's no indicator presented in the Touch Bar itself showing the name of the song or other content being played. However, this does offer a quick, two tap way to bring up the currently playing app so you can see what's playing. \n\n\nThis screen shot blurs the background music playback indicator, but it's the white line between the red iTunes icon and the track selection/pause buttons \n\nThe value of the Touch Bar changes based on the app you're using. When typing Notes, it basically serves as just a QuickType suggestion field, along with buttons for basic formatting and Note management. One key new features in Notes, however, is lockable Notes. Password protect a Note, and the Touch Bar directs you to authenticate with your fingerprint.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of Apple's bundled apps present Touch Bar buttons that let you access nearly all of their basic features from the strip. For example, Maps lets you search for a variety of common items like nearby restaurants, cafes or gas stations and then get directions or look up the location's website, call it, favorite it, get more information or share it with just two taps of the Touch Bar. Even utility apps like Activity Monitor expose one-tap control to the various tabs of the display, no mousing required at all.\n\n\n\n\nMaps' Touch Bar lets you search for key categories and get directions entirely from the Touch Bar \n\nApple's creative apps, like Photos and Final Cut Pro, offer more specialized technical controls that expose features you'd otherwise have to mouse around to select. Photos, for example, lets you pan through your photos, tap to favorite, tap to edit, and then tap to apply a filter or adjust Light or Color, with a live preview of what it will look like. \n\nPhotos is a great example of an app using the Touch Bar to present common macOS app features in a more iOS-like fashion, with direct manipulation in a simplified context where it's even more obvious what you're doing. (below, Photos in full screen mode editing an image. The same adjustment controls are presented in the Touch Bar. It's not conveyed in the screen shot, but the direct manipulation it offers is far more satisfying that trying to operate slider controls with the trackpad or a mouse).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThird party apps will need to make some effort to present useful features in the Touch Bar, but a variety are already working on functionality due immediately or later this year. Apple demonstrated initial developer support for Adobe Photoshop and djay Pro, an a variety of other developers have also announced they'll be adding specialized support for Touch Bar, including Microsoft's Office and Skype apps; photo editors Affinity Photo, Sketch and Pixelmator; video editor Da Vinci Resolve; Omni's productivity suite including OmniGraffle, OmniPlan, OmniFocus and OmniOutliner; journaling tool Day One; development text editor Coda; blogging tool Blogo and interior design modeling tool Live Home 3D.\n\nOverall, Touch Bar seems to be a lot smarter and thoughtful implementation of touch controls for a laptop compared to simply adding a touch screen to make the entire display actionable. I have several times reached out to tap something on a notebook screen after having worked on an iPad. It would seem to be a natural and obvious evolution in notebook computing to make the screen touchable, and clearly Microsoft has bought into the \"obviousness\" of that in its decade of trying to promote Tablet PCs followed by another several years of promoting touch-based Windows 7, 8 and 10. Touch Bar seems to be a lot smarter and thoughtful implementation of touch controls for a laptop compared to simply adding a touch screen to make the entire display actionable \n\nHowever, most users don't see a touch screen PC as being very compelling or valuable, particularly after the novelty wears off. It's fatiguing and pulls your hands off the keyboard. Touch works best when its the primary interface (such as on a phone or tablet) rather than simply being layered on top of the conventional mouse-based desktop. The Touch Bar seems to do a better job of bringing iOS-style touch to conventional notebooks than making the entire screen a touch surface. \n\nApple's Touch Bar puts multitouch controls just above the keyboard, where they remain visible even as you touch type. The more I use it, the more it seems that the dynamic —yet restrained —design of the Touch Bar offers something of real value: it's not just the ability to reach out and touch the existing display as a shortcut to selection with a pointing device. Instead, it presents a hot list of actions distilled down from the busy desktop interface.\n\nOther examples include Contacts where the Touch Bar offers big easy buttons for reaching the selected contact, with icons for calling, FaceTime or emailing. Tap the Edit button, and you get large buttons for adding a new phone number, email, birthday or address, after which you can immediately begin typing in the information. That's a quick alternative to mousing to a specific field and then returning to the keyboard or reaching out to touch small targets on a touchscreen monitor.\n\n\nTouch Bar gets thoughtful attention even from simple apps like Contacts \n\nSome of Apple's own apps have pretty basic support for the Touch Bar. In System Preferences, it would be more useful if you could edit a list of shortcuts to the Pref Panes you frequently access. Certainly, in some apps the options presented in the Touch Bar are little more than a novelty and at the very worst a distraction. \n\nHowever, there are useful shortcuts throughout even the bundled macOS apps, and the Pro apps Apple has demonstrated so far appear to make smart application of the Touch Bar--in conjunction with the trackpad--in ways that promise to save veteran users a lot of time when doing precise or repetitive tasks. \n\nApple's guidelines seek to keep the Touch Bar uncluttered and easy to use, with generally minimal use of colorful graphics and animations outside of sliding controls in-and-out of focus and representation of screen content or editing results. Touching control buttons and using sliders and other features of the Touch Bar feels fast and fluid. \n\nIt's also noteworthy that Apple's own implementation of the Touch Bar is far more sophisticated and useful than what was imagined in rumors this summer, where the display strip was portrayed as simply being a copy of the menu bar icons, and portrayed duplicative visualizations of on-screen progress bars and Siri animations, offering very little value to users. \n\nWhat's new #2: Intel Core i7 Skylake CPU, AMD GPU options \n\nIn addition to a new generation body design, the 2016 MacBook Pros also debut a new processor architecture based on Intel's Skylake CPUs, the chip designer's sixth generation Core processor. A primary feature of the new chip design is its ability to rapidly power down when computationally idle.\n\nThe 15 inch model has two base configurations: the first ($2399) using a 2.6 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 Skylake (6700HQ) with 6MB shared L3 cache (customizable to a 2.9 GHz Core i7 6920HQ with 8MB shared L3 cache for $300 more), and the second ($2799) being a 2.7 GHz quad-core Intel Core i7 Skylake (6820HQ) with 8MB shared L3 cache (customizable to a 2.9 GHz Core i7 6920HQ with 8MB shared L3 cache for $200 more). We tested the base version of the latter (a 2.7 GHz Core i7 6820HQ).\n\nGeekbench 4 benchmarking returned a single core score of 4295 and a multiple core score of 13296. Note that unlike iOS mobile devices, the architecture and interface of macOS makes it easier to benefit from multiple threads on multiple cores, more of the time.\n\n\n\n\nNote that despite not having had a major CPU upgrade since 2013, Apple's Mac Pro with 8 or 12 core Xeon processors remain 55-72 percent faster in multiple core benchmarks, while Apple's year-old 27 inch 5K iMac with a desktop quad core Core i7 scores about 25 percent faster. That means users with an insatiable need for processing power should consider Apple's non-mobile offerings. At the same time, mobile users can't exactly complain that their super thin MacBook Pro is marginally slower at peak tasks than a desktop class machine plugged into the power main. \n\nThe latest MacBook Pro scores are in line with the highest end, custom configured MacBook Pros previously available: last summer's models using \"best\" tier Intel's Crystalwell Core i7 CPUs that Apple offered. \n\nSo rather than being a major leap in processor power, the latest MacBook Pro delivers similar performance to premium chips at a lower base price, in a lighter, thinner enclosure. The new MacBook Pro is half a pound lighter than previously, so being able to deliver that slim package with similar performance to the high end--but at a lower base cost —is a pretty impressive engineering achievement. \n\nOnce a perpetual driver of faster processing every year, Intel's x86 architecture appears to be stuck in computational stasis. In part, that's intentional, as Intel focuses both on alternatives to raw speed (including the battery efficiency that's so important in mobile machines, as highlighted in Intel's graphic below) as well as alternative ways to achieve performance (including faster bus designs, support for faster RAM and superior external interfaces), all of which contribute to better performance in ways that a blazing fast CPU engine on its own can't equal. After all, it doesn't matter how fast your processor is running if you're struggling to get data in and out of the system.\n\n\nIntel has been promoting power efficiency as a primary CPU design goal \n\nApple, too, has focused on new ways to enhance performance without simply relying on a monstrously fast CPU. Those initiatives largely align with Intel, including its support for the fastest power-efficient RAM supported by Intel's Skylake chips (16GB of 2133 MHz, PC3-17000 LPDDR3), as well as support for Thunderbolt 3 (offering massively fast 40 Gbps throughput for high speed peripherals, as well as being the first single-cable solution supporting 5K external displays), and ultra fast internal PCIe SSD storage. Apple representatives noted that Skylake's support for quad-core CPUs was a primary reason for selecting that Intel architecture over the newer Kaby Lake microarchitecture, which doesn't yet offer any four core versions \n\nApple has also been working to enhance multiple core CPU support in macOS, taking fuller advantage of the four core architecture of the Core i7. Apple representatives noted that Skylake's support for quad-core CPUs was a primary reason for selecting that Intel architecture over the newer Kaby Lake microarchitecture, which doesn't yet offer any four core versions. \n\nThe same issue of Intel failing to deliver a quad core version of is newest microarchitecture kept Apple from adopting Intel's newest Broadwell processors last year , and using Haswell chips instead. \n\nKaby Lake can also support more than 16GB of RAM, but currently requires the use of less power efficient RAM than the MacBook Pros were designed to use. So moving to Kaby Lake to get more RAM would not only involve lower battery life, but would also lower high end performance, maxing out with dual core CPUs. \n\nApple has been criticized for the engineering decisions it made in the newest MacBook Pros, but that criticism seems to be largely uninformed; those complaining about 16GB not being \"pro enough\" seem to have failed to catch the whole story.\n\nAnother major objective for Apple over the last few years has been to delegate more processing tasks to the GPU. That effort has increased with the appearance of Metal on macOS. Metal originated on iOS, where it was intended to slash the CPU overhead required to set up tasks for the GPU, whether graphical, or simply math optimized for calculation on a GPU core. On the Mac, Metal also helps to keep the GPU busy with less effort from the CPU, freeing general processing processor cores to do other tasks. \n\nThe benefits of the Metal architecture are harder to present in benchmarks, because most graphics benchmarks seek to fully saturate the GPU without regard for how busy the CPU is. Ideally, both the CPU and GPU are otherwise idle while running graphics benchmarks, but running benchmarks that way also buries the core intent of Metal. In real world scenarios, OpenGL typically can't fully exploit the GPU because the CPU feeding it is too busy itself with OpenGL overhead and other non-graphical tasks.\n\nDevelopers, however, report that using Metal does help enormously by enabling them to more efficiently schedule more graphics operations on the GPU without bottlenecking the CPU. That allows games, for example, to assign more non-graphical operations such as physics calculations to the CPU while the GPU runs closer to being fully utilized. \n\nThe new MacBook Pro pairs the basic Intel HD Graphics 530 (on Intel's CPU package) with a dedicated AMD Radeon Pro 450 or 455 GPU with 2GB of its own RAM. There's also a $100 option for an AMD Radeon Pro 460 paired with 4GB of GDDR5 memory, which Apple noted was a first in any notebook. Note that it's a $200 option on the lower end version of the 15 inch MacBook Pro.\n\n\n\n\nLike previous models, macOS can automatically activate and switch to the dedicated GPU when necessary and fall back to integrated graphics to save energy. Apple states that the discreet Radeon Pro graphics on this generation MacBook Pro is up to 130 percent faster in 3D graphics over the previous models. \n\nWhat's new #3: Ultra fast PCIe-based SSD storage & USB-C Thunderbolt 3 expansion ports \n\nAlong with enhanced utilization of the GPU, another key performance bottleneck Apple has taken aim at is hard drive storage. Conventional hard drives use a spinning magnetic platter, which has long been cost effective but has a series of downsides in a notebook: they're large, they generate heat, they're potentially susceptible to impact shock and they're much slower than solid state storage drives (SSD) using flash memory chips. \n\nApple fully embraced SSD with MacBook Air back in 2008, making it the only option. Since then, it has worked to develop faster technology and to bring the cost of SSD storage down to make it competitive with spinning disks. While still significantly more expensive than hard drives, SSD is so much faster that it makes a huge difference in general throughput and is very noticeable in every user interaction from booting to opening apps to saving files. MacBook Pros put their SSD storage directly on the PCIe bus, enabling them to be materially faster than PC alternatives that use SATA interfaces \n\nMacBook Pros put their SSD storage directly on the PCIe bus, enabling them to be materially faster than PC alternatives that use SATA interfaces. Apple has also fully adopted Intel's Thunderbolt 3 architecture for exposing the high speed PCIe to external peripherals. Thunderbolt 3 supports up to 40 Gbps file transfers, in addition to multiplexing DisplayPort signaling. Further, Apple uses the same USB-C connector for Thunderbolt 3 and and for USB 3.1 peripherals, as well as for power input. \n\nI connected an external 3TB USB 3.0 mechanical hard drive, and using the Blackmagic Disk Speed Test app (which uses noise data to simulate real video transfers), I got 70 MBps (560 Mbps) write and 19.1 MBps (153 Mbps) read results. The upper limit for USB 3 is 480 Mbps. The upper limit for USB 3.1 is 5 Gbps. The System Information panel listed the connected external drive as being on the USB 3.1 Bus (I purchased it as a USB 3.0 device). \n\nIn comparison, the same drive barely scored 23 MBps (184 Mbps) write and 14.1 MBps (113 Mbps) read results on a MacBook Air using standard USB 2.0. That highlights how much difference the connection technology makes, in addition to the overall speed of the system.\n\nThunderbolt 3 has an upper limit of 20 Gbps per channel on two separate buses. I did not have a Thunderbolt 3 storage system to test. However, the internal 512GB SSD, like Thunderbolt, uses PCIe, the fastest bus on the machine, without any intermediary protocol such as SATA to slow things down. It is very fast, scoring 1875.4 MBps (15,000 Mbps) in writes and consistently maxing out the benchmark app at its upper limit of 2,000 MBps (16,000 Mbps or 15 Gbps) for reads. That's really fast. \n\n\n\n\nApple outlines SSD sequential read speeds up to 3.1 GBps and sequential write speeds of 2.2 GBps, which is up to 50 percent faster than the previous generation of MacBook Pros. You can also now configure 2TB of SSD storage, although it's a very expensive option.\n\nMoving from the base 15-inch model's 256GB SSD costs $200 to get to 500 GB, $600 to upgrade to 1TB and $1400 to get to a 2TB SSD. The \"better\" 15-inch model starts with a 512GB SSD, and costs $400 to get to 1TB and $1,200 to reach 2TB.\n\nOther PC vendors offer cheaper SSD options, but those are lower performance SATA III drives, an option Apple doesn't offer on its MacBook Pros. Other PCIe SSD components are priced similar to Apple (and are relatively hard to find, as the budget-oriented PC world sticks with SATA for cost savings).\n\nIt remains to be seen what impact the upcoming Apple File System APFS will have on disk performance. Currently still in beta, the modern new file system for macOS and Apple's other platforms promises to be \"optimized for Flash/SSD storage and feature strong encryption, copy-on-write metadata, space sharing, cloning for files and directories, snapshots, fast directory sizing, atomic safe-save primitives, and improved file system fundamentals.\"\n\nBy standardizing on the ultrafast PCIe bus for its SSD options, Apple has the ability to optimize its file system software in ways that other platform vendors and their non-integrated partners can't. \n\nWhat's new #5: Wide Color Retina Display and enhanced speaker design \n\nOn top of being light, thin and fast, this year's new MacBook Pro also improves its audiovisual specifications, adopting an improved, Wide Color Retina Display and a redesigned audio system with louder, broader sound along with three mics for improving FaceTime chats and Siri voice recognition. \n\n\n\n\nApple first introduced support for the DCI P3 Wide Color gamut on its iPad Pro this summer, then expanded support to its newest iPhone 7. Like both of those introductions, the new MacBook Pro retains the same pixel resolution (2880x1800) but improves its brightness by two-thirds (arriving at 500 nits, which Apple attributes to brighter LED illumination, an optimized light guide panel and a larger pixel aperture) as well as increasing contrast by an identical two-thirds, resulting in deeper blacks and brighter whites. \n\nThe new support for Wide Color also means the screen shows the full color spectrum captured by iPhone 7's cameras. The DPI P3 gamut presents 25 percent more colors. The enhanced color gamut specification was developed for digital cinema, so it's not just your personal photographs that will be able to take advantage of its support for Wide Color. Once you get used to a Wide Color display, it's hard to go back. Additionally, the new screen is 30 percent more power efficient.\n\n\nApple's new speaker design for the 13 inch MacBook Pro \n\nThe new body design of the MacBook Pro also makes room for larger speakers. Apple says they create louder sound with twice the dynamic range, and that the positioning creates a greater stereo separation. I initially noticed this, but before I could do much testing, the review machine I used stopped producing sound entirely. However before that occurred I was actually surprised by the Mail delivery sound appearing to slide across my keyboard and fly into the ether. \n\nAfter I tried invoking Siri from the Touch Bar, audio returned and began working normally. Well, normally where the new normal is really loud. At full volume, music playback fells very loud, almost uncomfortably so in a quiet room. The very wide stereo imaging is a huge shift from my mono MacBook Air, where all the sound comes from one side. The big MacBook Pro audio upgrade is a really important new feature, and comes in tandem with larger, louder sound from Apple's other big 2016 releases, including the iPad Pro and iPhone 7 \n\nThe sound quality is impressively crisp; Apple notes that the tweeters are pointed right at your face from both sides of the keyboard. The lower frequency woofers emit sound through the sides of the unit, reflecting from the surface you have it sitting on. \n\nThat means if you have it balanced on your lap, the sound can lose some of its depth. On a desk, the sound is immersive, wide, clear and impressively substantial, particularly given the thin outline of the machine. The big MacBook Pro audio upgrade is a really important new feature, and comes in tandem with larger, louder sound from Apple's other big 2016 releases, including the iPad Pro and iPhone 7: Wide Color, Wide Sound!\n\nWhat's new #6: larger new Force Touch trackpad and improved \"butterfly\" keyboard \n\nTwo of the most obvious visual differences of the new MacBook Pros, once you open it up, are the huge new trackpad and the ultra low profile keyboard. The trackpad represents the second generation of Force Touch on the MacBook Pro. The first version of Force Touch was the same size as previous trackpads, necessitated by the fact that it was installed into the shell designed for the original, mechanical trackpad. \n\nThe clicking mechanism is gone, replaced (similar to the iPhone 7 Home Button ) with a virtual click delivered by a vibration actuator behind it. It feels very real, like a perfectly balanced button that's just too big to be so precise if it were an actual button surface rather than an Force Touch panel. \n\n\nThat's a big trackpad \n\nBecause the new design is no longer constrained by the physics of a hinged button that depresses inward, it can be large. Apple made it huge: twice as big as the previous 15 inch MacBook Pro. The point? It's easier to click, drag and perform other gestures, even when starting from the middle of the trackpad. And while macOS hasn't introduced any new multitouch gestures specifically for the new trackpad, some of those existing ones make more sense now that the trackpad is so large. \n\nFor example, a three or four finger + thumb pinch is easier to use to reveal the Desktop or to bring up the home page of apps on Launchpad. You can also more naturally swipe in from the right side with two fingers to reveal Notifications and widgets. Additionally, used in combination with buttons or other controls in the Touch Bar, you can comfortably make selections across the much larger trackpad while picking different options about using your opposite hand.\n\nThe new MacBook Pro keyboard is the second version of Apple's \"butterfly\" mechanism first introduced on the Retina MacBook. It's improved, but there's still very little travel in the keys. When I first started typing, I found it felt both foreign and flat and seemed to be louder when typing (in comparison with my MacBook Air). \n\nAfter some typing, the keys quickly began to feel more familiar, although the tapping sound of the keyboard continues to be somewhat distracting. On a MacBook Air —or the company's other conventional \"scissor\" design key switches —hitting individual keys is closer to silent, but the key caps themselves seem to jiggle around a bit as you type. This less precise design of the Air keyboard also results in more light leakage around the keys.\n\n\nThe previous MacBook Air keyboard leaks more illumination around the keycaps. \n\nThere are subjective advantages to both, but I soon found the new keyboard comfortable to type on; moving back to a different keyboard now results in the earlier designs feeling foreign.\n\nThe new MacBook Pro keyboard is thinner and flatter, and individual keys don't feel like floating plastic caps; they feel closer to tapping on a membrane. Keys are also closer together with less blank space between them. Having spent some time typing, I can now say I like the new keyboard design. It also serves an important contribution to the new machine's remarkable thinness and portability. \n\nFurther, the new keyboard also closely integrates into the Touch Bar. Moving back to a non-Touch Bar machine feels particularly archaic, like a step back into the distant past. It's worth noting that if the keys were any more substantial and had a greater throw of movement, the hard, flat Touch Bar would feel less integrated. \n\nCurrently, the perfectly flat Touch Bar feels a bit dead when you tap it after having banged at the physical keys for a while. There's no haptic feedback, so it's the same as moving from a physical keyboard to tapping on an iPad screen. The new keyboard therefore fits into a middle ground between a deeper keyboard throw and a totally flat experience like that of typing on the glass of an iPad. \n\nThe new Touch Bar MacBook Pro in review \n\nIt's as thin as an Air and feels not much heavier, but packs all the Pro features Mac users are accustomed to at the higher end: desktop class performance, broad expansion connectivity and super fast, larger capacity internal storage. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe new model also delivers a huge, spectacular Retina Display; great built-in sound and a large, accurate trackpad. The new keyboard is a reflection of its thinness, and paired with whizzy new Touch Bar and Touch ID, the new machine delivers a satisfying, futuristic experience and is just fun to use.\n\nIt remains to be see how extensively third party developers will take specialized, functional advantage of the Touch Bar in their apps. However, even in apps that make no special use of the Touch Bar, Apple's design exposes common Control Strip features and Siri, and presents word and emoji suggestions as you type, making the new strip useful regardless.\n\nWhat could have been better? If you're looking for an iMac-class machine that folds up and can be carried off site, there's two problems standing in the way. Apple doesn't make thick heavy laptops anymore, clearly because there wasn't that much interest in machines the size and weight of 17-inch MacBook Pros. But secondly, Intel doesn't even make the chips to power fast, quad core machines with vast amounts of RAM, even if Apple wanted to build a small batch of thick machines that didn't have very good battery life. \n\nGiven that reality, it's hard to criticize the design decisions behind the new MacBook Pro. Its CPU is not much faster than previous models, but that's largely because of equally important, parallel priorities of Intel, which is also aware of what kinds of features and form factors sell best. Power efficiency, light weight, a thin design and fast connectivity are all preferable in the market to simple clock speeds. \n\nAlong those same lines, while there's been criticism of Apple ditching old port types and even its own MagSafe, the wholesale move to one plug for everything is really better for users overall, individuals who have divergent needs. It would not be better for the new MacBook Pro to be saddled with old connectors for USB-A and Thunderbolt 2 / Display Port. In fact, the edge walls of the new system are slimmer than the shell of an USB-A port itself (below, Apple's $9 USB-C to USB-A adapter).\n\n\nThe new MacBook Pro edge wall is slimmer than the shell of an USB-A port \n\nNot having to visually line up the direction of a USB port is so much nicer than the original USB type plug, and the fact that a simple adapter might be needed in the transition —one that costs less than $10, or can be solved with the use of a USB-C hub, really leaves this a problem without an issue.\n\nThe new MacBook Pros also now have more flexible USB-C power adapters (below, which can now be used to also rapidly power your iPhone, iPad or any other device rather than being solely useable as a MacBook charger). They can be charged from either side, or draw power from a display or dock or power bank designed for USB-C devices, including solar panels like the Solartab C and other common external battery packs. \n\n\nLightning, USB-C and the original USB-A. The new power adapters can also now charge other USB devices, with an appropriate cable, meaning you only have to pack one adapter when traveling \n\nThe four ports all serve as both USB 3.1 ports and as high performance Thunderbolt 3 interfaces, and can support massive resolution external displays. A 5K display packs over 2.5 times as many pixels as even the built-in Retina Display, and thanks to Thunderbolt 3, this machine can power two of them. It can also drive four 4K screens. You'll need to be careful about selecting cables, as the physically identical USB-C used by USB 3 and Thunderbolt 3 has different requirements for cabling related to the speed and power a given cable can support (just the same as a given Category of Ethernet cabling). \n\nHowever, the super flexible, uniform \"everything on one connector\" design of Thunderbolt 3 is clearly the future of cabling high performance peripherals, displays and external storage units. You'll most certainly need a new cable adapter for some of your existing devices, including your iPhone. Several low cost USB docks, some sporting an SD Card reader, should adequately handle most user's backward compatibility needs. \n\nOne last issue that has gained lots of attention is that these MacBook Pro models and their upgrades are not cheap. Apple's typically premium pricing is nothing new, but as PC prices plummet and buyers begin to eye lower cost computing solutions--including Apple's own iPad Pro offerings —Apple's remaining holdout as the notebook maker that sells significant volumes of machines well above $1,000 has everyone wishing that these machines were easier to afford. \n\nApple's 15-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar asks a steep price, but also delivers an incredible balance of power and efficiency, with industry leading support for technologies like PCIe SSD storage, Thunderbolt 3 connectivity and OS-integrated support for Wide Color gamut imaging. The Touch Bar —along with Touch ID —offers new conveniences and exposes features in new ways, allowing an innovative style of immediate, iOS-like interaction on conventional notebooks. \n\nThese MacBook Pros weigh in at $2,400 to $2,700 before adding premium upgrades such as a high capacity SSD or faster CPU and GPU, luxury prices that take your breath away. However, by all accounts it appears Apple knows its audience and will have no problem selling significant volumes of these high end machines. \n\nUnderneath its premium flagship, Apple has a number of lower priced options ranging from the entry MacBook Pro lacking a Touch Bar, to the even more mobile but less capable Retina MacBook to the now entry level non-Retina MacBook Air, and more economy priced iPad and iPad Pro offerings. \n\nOn the other hand, some professional and prosumer users with needs for more RAM and processing power than this super thin notebook can deliver are either going to wait for future Intel components to arrive or invest in desktop machines —although both Apple's iMac and Mac Pro models are currently hanging in the wind without recent processor bumps and lacking any roadmap for some of the new technologies introduced on the latest MacBook Pros, including Thunderbolt 3. \n\nBut still: this light, thin powerhouse with an iOS-inspired touch interface panel, fast Touch ID fingerprint authentication and an incredibly fast architecture and connectivity options will spark excitement among those who can afford to pay Apple prices for Apple designed gear. \n\nScore: 4 out of 5",

      "text": "Facebook First look: The 13-in MacBook Pro's Touch Bar wows The newest Apple laptop offers a host of innovations, but it's the virtual function keys that get the attention. Ken Mingis (Computerworld (US)) 15 November, 2016 00:06 - Comments \nWhen you show someone Apple's new 13-in MacBook Pro -- the one with the virtual Touch Bar -- the first thing they'll want to do is play with the darn thing. They'll adjust the screen brightness or turn up the volume. Launch some apps to see the virtual buttons change. And slide their fingers along it to see how it feels. \nAnd they'll probably agree that, as innovations go, this is one cool update to a laptop line that was long overdue for an upgrade. \nBut that's not the only big change to the 13-in. model that I've just unboxed -- or the larger 15-in. models due to arrive later this week. Here's what would-be buyers eyeing the new MacBook Pro are most likely to notice. \nThe Space Gray aluminum body is flat-out gorgeous, and marks a welcome break from aluminum-and-black look of previous models. The Retina screen is not just brighter, but shows more saturated colors than any Retina screen I've used. (For the first time, I had to turn the brightness down a couple of notches.) \nThe keyboard is, well, different. It's flatter, shallower and has a hollow-sounding \"click\" when keys are pressed. The Trackpad, where you spend a lot of time navigating through apps, clicking and pinching and swiping, is indeed huge compared to previous models. \nOh, and there are exactly four ports -- two on each side -- and an old-school audio jack. The USB-C-style Thunderbolt 3 ports represent a leap into the future, and they mean you're almost certainly going to need adapters to connect up older peripherals, whether it's an external monitor, a backup drive, an external keyboard or even a thumbnail drive. (There's a reason Apple just lowered the prices on all of its USB-C adapters .) \nBut it's the Touch Bar , which Apple execs highlighted when the new MacBook Pros were unveiled on Oct. 27, that sets this laptop apart from earlier models. The Touch Bar replaces the function keys at the top of the keyboard with a lighted strip that dynamically changes depending on what application you're using. \nIt also returns to the MacBook Pro something that's been missing from Macs in recent years: fun. By combining the company's usual attention to detail and design with a bit of whimsy, the Touch Bar showcases technology in a way that makes you want to discover just what happens when you use it. The Touch Bar and Touch ID \nNestled at the top of the keyboard where the function keys used to be, the new Touch Bar is the design change for this generation of MacBook Pros. (There is also the 13-in model with normal function keys .) And it really is useful -- though it's going to require retraining some muscle memory to get the most out of it in day-to-day use. \nThe Touch Bar is essentially a thin, horizontal, full-color OLED touch screen that offers various functions that change as you move through apps or macOS Sierra. (The display is 2170 x 60 pixels, and is set up so that the optimum viewing angle is 45 degrees.) \nSelect the desktop with your cursor, and the Touch Bar lets you do things like increase and decrease the screen brightness or audio, access Siri or skip through the tracks playing in iTunes. Launch the Mail program and you can tap the Touch Bar to start a new email, reply to someone, file an email or mark something as junk. It even suggests words based on the context of what you're writing, just as iOS does on the iPhone when sending texts and emails. \nThe TouchBar also allows you to tap a virtual button and then use it as a slider (such as when changing the screen brightness). Functions change instantly and the Touch Bar is always well-lit (there's no separate brightness control for it). The finish makes it feel like one of the keys on the keyboard -- albeit a very, very wide one. You can even customize it by dragging icons from the display to the Touch Bar. Ken Mingis \nThe Touch Bar can be customized by dragging and dropping \"key\" icons from the screen to the keyboard. \nSo it's cool, and it works as billed. But is it useful? Yes, although in limited ways at the moment. Once more apps are updated to take advantage of it -- Microsoft has already said it plans to do just that with its Office suite -- it'll be even more useful. So it has great potential, as long as you remember to use it fully. \nTouch ID is useful in a different way. Integrated at the right-side end of the Touch Bar, it works pretty much as Touch ID works on the iPhone or iPad. You hold your finger on the sensor until it reads your fingerprint pattern, and then you can use it to unlock your MacBook Pro or make online purchases. Setting it up is simple, and it's worked every time I've used it (though I haven't tried to authenticate any purchases with it yet). Ken Mingis \nThe Touch Bar points to the Touch ID button to remind you it can be used to unlock the computer. \nAnd The Touch ID button also doubles as a Power button. You don't need it, since the MacBook Pro comes on when you raise the screen. But in the event of a crash requiring a hard restart, you just hold down the Touch ID button for 16 seconds. Screen, keyboard and trackpad \nApple didn't spend a lot of time talking up the new Retina display last month, but its execs should have. The screen is noticeably better than the one in the last-generation MacBook Pro. The scaled resolution is unchanged in the 13-in. model, meaning it's still 1680 x 1050 pixels. But the brighter screen and the wider P3 color gamut deliver vibrant colors and incredibly sharp text. Apple says the new screen is 67% brighter, offers 67% greater contrast -- and yet it's also more energy efficient. \nTo me it looks like the difference between a high-end 4K TV (last-year's MacBook Pro) and an OLED 4K TV (this new one). The difference is that dramatic. \nAs for the keyboard, I'm a little less celebratory. This is the second generation of the one that debuted on the smaller MacBook last year. It has a butterfly mechanism that allows the keys to be shallower (and consequently lets Apple slim down the laptop's thickness by several millimeters). The key travel is flatter than in the past, and it's going to take some getting used to. \nI'm certainly able to type as fast as before, and the full-size keyboard has keys with individual LEDs that light up in the dark. That means there's no light bleed around them, and make for an upscale, polished look. But the clicky sound of the keys is louder than I'm used to, and undercuts the design. If noisy keys bug you, type on one before you buy. They should appear in Apple stores in the next week or so. Ken Mingis \nThe oversized keys are backllit with individual LEDs. Here, the Touch Bar shows some of the options when Mail is open. Note also the oversized trackpad. \nAs for the new Trackpad, it's huge -- roughly 50% larger than in the past. That allows you to more easily use pinch and scroll motions to navigate through the OS and apps. And Apple's palm-rejection software seems to work just fine. I have yet to have a problem where resting my hand on the trackpad led to unwanted input. All USB-C, all the time \nOne of the big concerns for would-be buyers involves Apple's decision to do away with the various ports. USB-A, SD card slots, Ethernet, display ports -- they're all gone, replaced here with the USB-C ports. Sure, the audio jack means you can use your old headphones (or wireless ones), but even something as simple as connecting an iPhone or iPad to sync with the laptop requires an adapter. That mismatch is rather un-Apple-like. \nThat said, the ports are Thunderbolt 3 port, meaning they can carry up to 40Gbps of data and you connect any device to any port. Want to plug in the charging cable on the right side instead of the left? (I do.) You're in luck. You can also connect multiple external monitors. But if you have a lot of peripherals -- anything from an external display to a backup drive or keyboard -- you'll need an adapter. That may explain Apple's wise decision to drop prices on the various adapters and dongles it sells. \nAs for me, I only ever plug in my Time Machine backup drive, an iPhone and an iPad. And I already have a mini-port replicator that allows me to connect to USB-C. The port issue matters to potential buyers, but I wouldn't let it stop you from getting the new MacBook Pro. The line-up and specs \nApple actually unveiled three new MacBook Pros last month. There are two models with the Touch Bar -- the 13-in. and 15-in. versions -- and a 13-incher that has traditional function keys. That latter model has two USB-C ports instead of four, but otherwise offers all of the other updates; it won plaudits from Computerworld 's Michael deAgonia . If you don't care about the Touch Bar, that's the Pro for you. Plus, it starts at $1,499 -- a full $300 less than this model. \nIf you do want the Touch Bar, you're going to pay. The least expensive MacBook Pro with it (the one I've been using) starts at $1,799. The cheapest 15-in. model is $2,399; like this one, it comes with just 256GB of storage. You can also custom-order a MacBook Pro and get a slightly faster processor and up to 2TB of SSD-based storage. Or you can spend $2,799 and get 512GB of storage, a faster quad-core i7 processor and a slightly better Radeon Pro graphics card. That's the one I bought for myself. \nAll 13-in. models start with 8GB of RAM, but for $200 more, you can double that to 16GB; all 15-in. models come with 16GB of RAM. That's more than enough for what most people will need, but it has prompted concerns among some users about whether it will be enough in a few years. (Given the memory compression in macOS Sierra, I expect it to be just fine down the road, but your mileage may vary.) \nIf you want to max out a MacBook Pro, you can opt for a speedier processor (the dual-core i5 in the 13-in. model maxes out at 3.3GHz; the quad-core i7 in the 15-in. model tops out at 2.9GHz); upgrade the GPU; and get a 2TB SSD. It'll cost you $4,299, plus tax. Spend wisely. Ken Mingis \nThe Touch Bar also shows tabs when Safari is in use and you can select them with a quick tap. Odds, ends and final thoughts \nThe launch of this year's MacBook Pro caused a lot of consternation among the Mac faithful, with complaints focused on higher prices, the wholesale move to USB-C, storage limits on entry-level models and a 16GB ceiling on RAM. Those latter two prompted my colleague, Computerworld freelance writer Michael deAgonia, to go on an extended rant during my \"Mingis on Tech\" show. (See the video below.) He's not alone; columnist Steven J. Vaughan-Nichols has doubts as well . \nOther non-buyers are upset that the traditional Apple start-up chime is gone (no longer needed since the MacBook Pro powers up as you raise the lid); some also lament the loss of the lighted Apple on the backside of the display. Still others wanted more powerful GPU cards. \nThose are generally valid concerns -- I'll miss the familiar Mac start-up BOING -- but they miss the larger point. By its nature, any laptop design involves compromises. Thin and light means less room for a big battery (or different ports). A faster CPU or GPU could mean more heat. A different keyboard means added thickness. And on and on. \nEven so, Apple says that sales of the new model have been brisk, and delivery dates are already stretching into December. So someone is buying these things. Just take a look at excited buyers on this Macrumors forum trying to figure out when their new laptops will arrive. (The 15-in. model I ordered 10 minutes after the Oct. 27 event ended is set to arrive Thursday. I got the shipping notice yesterday.) \nHaving spent a few days with the smaller MacBook Pro, I'm confident I made the right choice. The new look, updated internals, the super-bright screen and the innovative Touch Bar all deliver in spades. Battery life seems to match Apple's 10-hour estimate. The SSD drive really is super speedy . That being the case, I'm curious to see whether deAgonia changes his tune after he's had some time with a 15-in. Touch Bar model for his upcoming review.",

      "text": "Higher-end models of Apple's MacBook Pro now come with a narrow touch screen above the regular keyboard for quick access to common settings and tasks, while Lenovo's Yoga Book laptop loses the physical keyboard entirely. The traditional keyboard has never struck me as needing much improvement, although people who've grown up on touch screens might well feel differently. [...] how do the new touch features improve typing and computing? [...] when fixing typos in documents, selecting email to delete and even editing photos, my trackpad is generally more precise than my fat fingers on the screen. When you're using the Safari browser, for instance, you typically get thumbnails of individual tabs for easy switching between websites . The new volume and brightness sliders are much easier to use than tapping the appropriate function key multiple times to get the level I want. [...] the Touch Bar does make it easy to include emojis in messages. Because I use it frequently, I made the screenshot function a default icon. In place of a power button is a fingerprint scanner, similar to what's found on mobile devices. [...] the 10-inch Yoga Book (about $500 for Android, $600 for Windows) retains the clamshell design of a laptop but has a second touch screen where the keyboard normally goes. If it makes it onto a future laptop, it could mark a true revolution that goes well beyond the minor changes the Touch Bar and the second touch screen offer.",

      "text": "Chinese media: Trump's trade war will hurt Apple and Boeing Although it's just conjecture... for now. Share Save \nIf the next president starts imposing trade tariffs on China, then he's going to be harming America's own companies. That's the line from China's Global Times , which has published an editorial theorizing potential responses to any future trade war. For instance, should the US follow through on promises on the campaign trail and block sales of Chinese products, the nation will retaliate in kind. For instance, China would ditch Boeing orders in favor of those from Airbus, or ban sales of Apple's iPhone in the country where it's manufactured. \nIt's important to note, however, that while Global Times is a state-run outfit, it's hardly the best venue for saber-rattling. If China really wanted to drop some not-so subtle warnings about international relations, it'd use Global Times' parent the People's Daily , or Xinhua News . This byline-free editorial is more of a rebuke to the accusation that China is a currency manipulator. The stuff about blocking the iPhone and Boeing seem to be baseless conjecture than anything else. Although, given how far baseless conjecture can get you these days, maybe we should worry.",

There's no such thing as a too-big trackpad. The Touch Bar is remarkably well-executed. The ability to charge from any port is pretty great. Tired The world is not quite ready for USB-C, and you're not either. The Touch Bar needs more customization, and soon. Laptops aren't supposed to be this expensive, are they? 1/10 A complete failure in every way 2/10 Sad, really 3/10 Serious flaws; proceed with caution 4/10 Downsides outweigh upsides 7/10 Very good, but not quite great 8/10 Excellent, with room to kvetch 9/10 Nearly flawless 10/10 Metaphysical perfection \n“For 25 years,” Tim Cook said while unveiling the device , “we’ve been defining and redefining what a notebook is and what it can do.” Dramatic pause. “And today, we’re going to do it again.” Of course, Apple expects you to pay up: the MacBook Pro with Touch Bar starts at $1,800. \nIt’s been several years since the last big MacBook update, and mine is, like yours, long in the tooth. I’d been waiting for a reason to buy a new one, and jumped at the chance to try the new Pro. This is supposed to be it! The laptop of the future, and the future of the laptop. After using it, poking and prodding it, and plugging things into it, I have one word of advice. \nWait. Can Touch This \nPeople love Apple computers because Apple gets the basics right. The keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speakers, all the table-stakes things too many companies get wrong. And in most cases, Apple made the best even better with the new MacBook Pro. Apple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as a revolutionary overhaul, but it’s certainly the biggest change Apple’s made in years. \nThe trackpad doesn’t physically click, but feels like it does, and it is so big and smooth you’d be crazy to use a mouse. The keyboard (a refined take on the 12-inch MacBook’s butterfly keys ) doesn’t have much travel and takes getting used to, but it’s accurate and crisp and works beautifully. The speakers are louder and clearer than ever. I get eight or nine hours from the battery, as long as I’m not Photoshopping all day and keep the brightness below eye-bleeding levels. And the screen is, well, the screen is ridiculous. Apple’s ultra-wide color gamut, on top of the super-high resolution, makes it the best laptop display I’ve ever seen. \nThe 13-inch Pro, which I’ve been using, is a bit over half an inch thick and weighs almost exactly three pounds. I carried a MacBook Air for years, and this feels like that. (The footprint is actually a bit smaller.) Everything about it, even the charger, is smaller than ever. Apple could have kept the body the same and added more battery, or more power, but opted for smaller and lighter. How you feel about that says a lot about whether you’ll like the new Pro. \nApple’s Touch Bar doesn’t quite count as revolutionary, but it’s the biggest change in years. The thin OLED strip, where the function keys used to be, knows which app you’re in, tries to guess which features or settings you might need, and puts them within reach (barely) of your fingertips. In Safari, the Touch Bar offers small indicators for each tab and bookmark, plus quick access for search and opening a tab. In Messages, it becomes the Emoji Bar, which is objectively the best thing ever. You can scrub through your timeline in Final Cut, or swipe through photo albums in Photos. There’s no new functionality here, just easier and more obvious access to common stuff. \nTechnically, the Touch Bar works brilliantly. It’s fast and smooth and responsive. The textured glass feels great, and looks fantastic. Using my fingerprint on the Touch ID reader to log in and to pay for stuff is the best. But the implementation feels unfinished. \nWith no function keys, shortcuts for adjusting brightness and controlling music are hidden in a tiny menu to the right of the Touch Bar. Three are accessible at a tap: mute, volume, and screen brightness. (What madman needs brightness controls that much?) Pausing or playing music—something I do about 45,000 times daily—requires carefully tapping on the tiny left arrow, waiting a moment for the menu to expand, then finding and pressing the button. \n“It takes a heartbeat longer to pause my music” hardly qualifies as a burn-it-down kind of problem. But the Touch Bar exists precisely to make these small, repetitive tasks easier. And too often, it just doesn’t have the option or button I’m looking for. The screen changes constantly, moving things around to the point where I can’t find anything. I’d like to see Apple open the Touch Bar so users can customize it. Then it could be everything I want it to be, because I could make it so. Right now, I’m subject to Apple’s best guess about what I want. \nApple often guesses wrong. Pros, and Cons \nThe entry-level 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar costs $1,799. It has a 2.9GHz Core i5 processor, 256 gigs of solid-state storage, eight gigs of RAM, and Intel Iris 550 graphics. Most benchmarks show that it’s faster than the previous Pro without being preposterously so. Now, if you don’t know or care what any of that means, it’s probably way more computer than you need. So is the 12-inch MacBook, honestly. That’s probably a better machine, if you don’t need more than a browser. More MacBook",

      "title": "Apple could copy Samsung's curved display with the iPhone 8",
      "text": "With Samsung still in the midst of an unrivalled tech disaster, Apple will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief as it surges ahead to the top of the smartphone mountain. Thanks to a consistently slow update cycle from the latter, though, Sammy still has the lead on a couple of features — with the most noticeable being the pretty, curved screen of the Galaxy S7 Edge. With that said, that gap could be about to narrow. According to a Barclays Research note sent to MacRumors, the iPhone 8 will come with a larger display. Referring to supply chain checks, Barclays Research analysts believe Apple will switch from the current 4.7-inch iPhone 7 and 5.5-inch iPhone 7 Plus to the larger 5- and 5.8-inch displays for its next flagships. Related: iPhone 8 release date, rumours, news, specs and price Of course, this would mark the first screen size change since the iPhone 6 dropped in 2014. Not only could the displays see an increase, but we could also be treated to an edge-to-edge screen with pretty much no bezels and the much-rumoured OLED tech. But is any of this actually likely? Well, considering how far away we sit from the next iPhone, it's important to apply salt to anything we hear. With the 10th anniversary of the device coming next year, though, it would be a surprise if Apple didn't mark the occasion with a much-needed overhaul. Whether that includes a fresh display will likely become clearer over the coming, erm, nine months or so. ",

      "title": "Apple MacBook Pro with Touch Bar (13-inch, 2016) review - CNET",
      "text": "Next Prev New look, higher price \nFlip open the aluminum lids of these new laptops and almost everything -- including the keyboard and touchpad -- looks reinvented, too. On the outside, the physical design is just different enough to mark it as a new generation, without radically rewriting the DNA of the MacBook Pro. \nThese new laptops are thinner and lighter. That's no surprise, although they don't come close to competing with the slimmest high-end Windows laptops. The 13-inch model is 14.9 mm thick and weighs 3 pounds (about 1.36 kg), while the 15-inch model is 15.5 mm thick and 4 pounds (1.81 kg). That's compared to 18 mm for the previous 13- and 15-inch Pros, which were each about a half-pound (0.23 kg) heavier than their replacements. James Martin/CNET \nIf you're looking for the thinnest possible laptop, HP's Spectre and Acer's Swift 7 , both powered by new seventh-generation \"Kaby Lake\" Intel Core i7 processors, are both less than 10 mm thick. Left feeling positively massive by comparison is the classic MacBook Air, once the king of the thin laptops, at 17 mm. \nBesides the traditional silver, the new MacBook Pros come in space gray, adding a splash of (muted) color to the previously monochromatic Pro. It joins the 12-inch MacBook (as well as the iPhone , iPad and Apple Watch) in giving you at least a little color customization. The space gray model isn't as striking as the classic black MacBook , but it's cool to see a bolder color. That's especially true on the larger 15-inch MacBook Pro, which wears its space gray finish with a subtle sophistication. Not so cool: The MacBook Pro gets a painful price hike. \nNot so cool: The MacBook Pro gets a painful price hike. The 13-inch Pro with a dual-core Intel Core i5, 8GB of RAM and 256GB of storage costs $1,799. The 15-inch model, with a quad-core Core i7 (all part of Intel's sixth-generation of Core i-series chips, also known as \"Skylake\") and 16GB/256GB, sells for $2,399. The 15-inch models also include discrete AMD Radeon graphics, just as the larger preceding Pros did. In terms of battery life, expect 10 hours of work time on both sized models. That's a tiny boost versus the old 15-incher, and exactly the same for the 13. (See the chart at the bottom of the page for UK and Australian pricing.) \nFor the most part, though, these specs -- especially the CPUs -- are a welcome update. They finally put the MacBook Pro on par with the best Windows laptops, whereas the previous models were a generation or more behind. (Those aforementioned superslim Windows laptops are powered by even newer seventh-generation \"Kaby Lake\" Intel processors, but those don't seem to offer a big performance boost over their predecessors.) James Martin/CNET \nA few other updates help justify the prices. The RAM is now a faster 2,133MHz version, while the built-in solid state storage can transfer data faster, at up to 3.1 gigabytes per second. According to Apple, the displays, while retaining the same Retina resolution, are both brighter and have a wider color range, and consume 30 percent less power. These are specs many users likely won't notice in everyday use, although faster storage is key for transferring large files (like videos) and a brighter screen is always welcome. Left off from my personal wish list is a full OLED display, a feature just starting to turn up in a handful of high-end Windows laptops . \nIf that's too much sticker shock, there's also an entry-level version of the 13-inch MacBook Pro that keeps the new design and keyboard/touchpad, but drops some of the specs and loses the Touch Bar in favor of a traditional row of function keys. That model starts at $1,499 and is available now. But keep in mind that before today, a 13-inch MacBook Pro could be had for as little as $1,299, so this is a big step up in price no matter which model you choose. I suspect there may be a few shoppers who try and track down the last stock of the previous 13-inch Pro to save some money. The second screen \nLaptops makers who mess with the traditional keyboard-plus-touchpad design are rarely rewarded. \nThe idea of adding a second screen to a laptop, or another place to touch and tap besides the touchpad, isn't new. But it rarely works. Previous attempts often included a secondary touch input at the expense of a primary input method. Razer sold a line of big-screen gaming laptops that replaced the traditional touchpad with a touch-sensitive LCD display that could act as a touchpad or as a context-sensitive screen. The clever idea was undone by two key flaws -- it moved the touchpad to the far right side of the laptop, and it had limited software support (mostly a handful of PC games ). \nAcer tried the Iconia 6120 , an ambitious full-size laptop that was essentially two 14-inch LCD screens clamshelled together. Both were standard laptop touch displays, but the bottom one could show a large, touch-sensitive on-screen keyboard, as well as media transport controls and other widgets. There was no second version. \nCraig Federighi (third from right), Apple's Senior Vice President of Software Engineering James Martin/CNET \nMore recently, Lenovo released the Yoga Book , a 10-inch hybrid with a vanishing keyboard. Its lower half is a Wacom tablet that can, at the touch of a button, display a backlit keyboard overlay. It's an impressive engineering feat, but the stylus-based slate mode worked much better than the hard-to-use keyboard. \nThe Touch Bar in the new MacBook Pro tries to skirt these pitfalls by focusing on the gaps left behind by the keyboard and (much larger) touchpad. It's an additional tool, rather than a replacement for something more practical. The thing that it does replace, the function key row, is itself a relic. \n\"Function keys were put into the notebook so you could do terminal emulation. That use has gone away for quite a long time now,\" says Phil Schiller, describing how the F-keys on your laptop were originally created for old computers to talk to even older computers. Since then, more consumer-friendly commands have been mapped to these keys, making for an occasionally awkward compromise. \"It's kind of a crazy thing to take an old, unused technology and map things onto it just so they're not nonfunctional.\" Phil Schiller \n\"It's kind of a crazy thing to take an old, unused technology and map things onto it just so they're not nonfunctional,\" Schiller adds. \"We've decided to remove them completely, and instead replace it with something built with modern technology that can adapt and do things we need to do with today's computing needs.\" \nWith its context-sensitive OLED secondary display, Apple abandons the pretext that we need a string of F-labeled keys at all. What we really want is all those other secondary commands, like adjusting the brightness or muting the audio. By default, the Touch Bar displays a command strip view with brightness, volume and other system control functions. When another Apple app is launched, including Photos, Mail or Safari , the command buttons roll up to the far right side of the strip, leaving the rest of the space free for app-specific commands, which can take the form of buttons, sliders or dials. \nApple's Phil Schiller James Martin/CNET \nThe possibilities seem limitless. \nDuring my visit to Apple's headquarters, I saw some examples demonstrated for me at our exclusive hands-on. These included a jog wheel for rotating photos in Apple's Photos app, suggested words and corrected spellings in Mail, and a tiny display of open tabs in Safari. \nThe Messages app naturally gives you a menu of emojis . Other programs, including Adobe's Photoshop, will support Touch Bar, which seems especially relevant for design and creativity apps. Future support from third-party apps and websites will make or break the Touch Bar. I'm eager to see what it can do when teamed with apps like Netflix or Spotify, which could hypothetically let you fast-forward through a movie or song with the slide of a finger. \nFederighi says the Touch Bar will make it easier to find and use features often buried in rarely accessed software submenus. \"Some of these apps have a lot of power that is often hidden behind menus and things, that they can surface contextually on the Touch Bar, which is so powerful.\" \nOf course, ditching that function key row claimed another casualty: the escape key. But the good news is that at least one of the customized Touch Bar designs already had a \"soft\" escape key right where we still expected it. \nThe 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pros side-by-side. Apple \nThe far right side of the Touch Bar has a small square set aside for a Touch ID input. That's the same fingerprint technology that's in current iPhones, and lets you log into the system and make payments via Apple Pay. You can do that already if you have a MacOS MacBook and an iOS 10 iPhone, if the two devices sit close to each other, but in the new MacBook, it's a self-contained system powered by Apple's built-in T1 security chip. \nAs a clever party trick, the new MacBook Pro can also switch user profiles on the fly, just by sensing a fingerprint. Simply place your finger on the sensor, and the other person's desktop logs out, replaced by yours. Twice the touch \nThe touchpad, which still uses Apple's Force Touch technology , now spans twice the surface area of the previous MacBook Pro's touchpad. It's massive -- completely dominating the front of the interior. It's also a bold challenge for other laptops to try and match (though some HP models have been down this path, too). \nLike the touchpads in the previous-gen MacBook Pro and 12-inch MacBook -- Apple prefers to call them trackpads -- this one has four corner sensors under the glass pad, rather than the more traditional top-mounted hinge. That means the pad doesn't actually click down, but instead gives you a little force feedback kick. It feels a lot like a touchpad click, but lets you, for example, fast-forward a video by applying more finger pressure to the glass. It also takes up less space, so laptop bodies can be thinner. It's now in every laptop Apple makes, with the exception of the MacBook Air. James Martin/CNET \nWith such a large touchpad, how does the system know to reject errant palm hits while you're typing? \nFederighi tells me the palm-rejection software was already pretty finely tuned from the last major MacBook Pro refresh in 2012. \"I don't know if we fundamentally changed our algorithms because we got it pretty solid in the last generation,\" he says. \"We've had to tune it of course. We do all kinds of tuning of these. But our old algorithm does the job.\" Cracking the keyboard code \nSitting above the larger touchpad is a redesigned keyboard. It's going to be the topic of a lot of discussion. \nAnyone familiar with the 12-inch MacBook will have a better idea of what to expect. The keyboard here uses Apple's butterfly mechanism, which allows for shallower keys and a thinner body. Using a very shallow keyboard made sense in the very thin 12-inch MacBook, but it'll come as a bit of a shock for Pro users, who are used to the deep, clicky physical feedback of the current MacBooks. James Martin/CNET \nThe keyboard on the new MacBook Pro models have the same shallow key travel (an industry term for the distance the key moves downward to register an input) as the version on the 12-inch MacBook. But the new \"feel\" of the keys and how they register a click gives the keyboard a more substantial feel. In a brief typing test I was struck by how much the keyboard felt like the one on a 12-inch MacBook, and how unlike the current generation of MacBook Pros it felt. You lose that satisfying feeling of your fingers being on big, chunky keys that click down with a satisfying thunk. Instead, typing becomes a quieter, more subtle task. The keys in older MacBooks rise up from the system surface, like tiny platforms. Now, the keys just slightly break the plane of the keyboard tray. \nThe new keyboard feel will be one of the tallest hurdles for potential buyers to jump. MacBook keyboards are iconic, and for good reason. The biggest complaints I've heard from readers about Apple's 12-inch MacBook since its 2015 release have been about the shallow keyboard and the single USB-C port. Will MacBook buyers give the new keyboard design a shot? I found that the butterfly keyboard in the 12-inch MacBook wasn't my favorite. \nI eventually got used to it after a short adjustment period. Since then, I've easily typed over 100,000 words on the 2015 and 2016 MacBooks . But as an all-day, everyday computer keyboard, I'm unconvinced. Check back in a few weeks of heavy use and I'll offer a more complete opinion. The port problem \nEvery time some enterprising computer company takes away a port or connection on a laptop -- essentially branding it as a \"legacy\" port we can do without -- there's a huge outcry from aggrieved users over this loss of flexibility and expandability. Generally speaking, however, the doomsayers are almost always wrong, and the minimalists are right. \nWindows laptops in mainstream sizes have mostly dropped the Ethernet jacks and even the optical drives. Before that, a process of natural selection led to a survival-of-the-fittest array of ports, with VGA and DVI connections, parallel and PS/2 ports, and others vanishing at first slowly, then all at once. \nThe 12-inch MacBook started the trend of dropping nearly everything in favor of USB-C, which can carry Thunderbolt-speed data, connect to power, and through add-on adaptors, support USB sticks, HDMI output, and anything else you'd want to plug into a computer. James Martin/CNET \nIn the new MacBook Pro, Apple more than doubles down on the idea of USB-C; it quadruples down. There are now four USB-C ports, two on each side (except for the entry-level 13-inch Pro, which has only two USB-C ports) and nothing else. It's a bold move for a laptop that often spends a lot of time tethered to your desk, driving external displays or connected to storage drives. As with your iPhone 7 , get ready to stock up on some dongles. \nAnother carryover from the 12-inch MacBook: the beloved MagSafe power adapter is gone. Like the 12-inch MacBook, the new Pros juice up via USB-C, too. Generally speaking, the doomsayers are almost always wrong, and the minimalists are right. \nIt's actually not USB-C or nothing, though. There's one more port still hanging around the MacBook Pro. The humble headphone jack, recently excised from the iPhone 7, gets a reprieve here. For now. \n\"We have a lot of Pros who hook up to studio speakers or amplifiers,\" says Schiller, \"and we absolutely believe wireless is the way to go for headphones . But there are other uses on the desktop configuration with a notebook.\" A decade-long evolution \nThis major reworking of the MacBook Pro comes as the Pro line hits the 10-year mark. For the past decade, the MacBook family has largely defined the idea of a laptop in the public consciousness. Its silhouette is instantly recognizable across a crowded coffee shop or conference room. There's a reason almost every portrayal of a laptop in film or TV since the mid-2000s is either a MacBook or a silver-colored prop lookalike. The aluminum unibody, the minimal visual clutter (which I sometimes refer to as Apple's \"strictly enforced minimalism\"), the soft-focus beacon of a logo beaming out from the back of the lid. These all chime with the perceived user of the laptop's owner: young (at least in spirit), creative and, of course, affluent. These aren't cheap machines. \nMy 2006 review of the first-generation MacBook Pro highlights much of what's made the MacBook Pro such a popular laptop over the years. It reads: \"Apple's minimalist school of design is well represented in the MacBook Pro. Opening the lid, you'll find only a power button, a full-size keyboard, stereo speakers, a sizable touchpad with a single mouse button, and a built-in iSight camera that sits above the display. We're big fans of the keyboard's backlighting feature and the two-finger touchpad scroll (run two fingers down the touchpad and it scrolls like a mouse wheel).\" \nRereading that sent me down a rabbit hole, to the first review of the black polycarbonate MacBook (an Editor's Choice winner for 2006) and the very first MacBook Air review from 2008. The latter is the only one of these I consciously recall writing, largely because of the active back-and-forth debates held with my CNET colleagues at the time about the scandalous omission of an optical drive from that system, and its single USB port for connectivity.",

In this article, I showed that while Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) was cheap, there were other stocks which were as cheap or cheaper and, at the time, were doing better business-wise than Apple. To the horror of Apple fans, the stock I compared Apple to was Kohl's (NYSE: KSS ). The rain of criticism was mostly around comparing apples to oranges. Apparently, all of those Apple supporters suddenly forgot why they owned Apple. They owned Apple because they thought Apple was the better investment. They were, of course, oblivious to the fact that to know something is \"better\", you have to compare it to the alternatives, all the alternatives. In the investment world, you do this by: Comparing between different asset classes. You compare cash to bonds, to stocks, to real estate, to annuities, to whatever. And you compare within asset classes. So, you compare Microsoft to Intel. To Apple. To Wal-Mart. To JP Morgan. To Kohl's. Said another way, these people criticizing me wouldn't know Apple was better than sliced bread, if they hadn't compared it to sliced bread before. Never mind Kohl's. Now, we do all these comparisons because we want to hopefully find the best investment, which will provide the best returns for our money. Quite amazingly, I spent that entire article saying Apple was cheap, but still saying that Kohl's was probably cheaper and doing better broke some kind of commandment. Which is why we have to revisit the comparison today and see how it done and if anything has changed. So, How Have Apple And Kohl's Done? This is what happened since May 25: Apple closed at $99.62 on May 25. Apple closed at $108.43 this past Friday. Apple paid $1.14 in dividends since then. Kohl's closed at $35.89 on May 25. Kohl's closed at $53.22 this past Friday. Kohl's paid $1.00 in dividends since then. Putting it together, Apple returned a clean 10.0% since May 25. Kohl's returned 51.1% . Kohl's thus outperformed Apple by a full 41.1% in just 6 months . What was there to be learned from this massive performance disparity? The main lesson was that just because one name seems sexier than the other, more \"technological\" than the other, with a better brand than the other, that doesn't mean the sexy name will provide the better returns. Apple's stock performance wasn't just beaten by Kohl's. It was slaughtered by it. However, two more developments took place since May 25. These were: Apple's prospects have improved . While the last reported quarter still saw a significant revenue decline, the next quarter is already expected to show slight growth. The iPhone 7 is good enough that it shouldn't wreck near-term numbers. As for the iPhone 8, I've already written on why it will likely bring significant change and be a much more alluring device, in my article titled \" Apple: iPhone 8 Will Be The iPhone Steve Jobs Wanted \". Moveover, while Apple is the iPhone, it can't hurt that the renewal of the MacBook Pro line should bring near-term growth to that segment, aiding overall growth. Kohl's went up a lot while its prospects haven't materially changed . For instance, revenue is now expected to shrink 2.0% during 2016, whereas at the time of the original article it was expected to drop by 1.6%. While the stock rallied very strongly after its Q3 2016 earnings report, Kohl's still reported declining same-store sales. As a result of these developments and Kohl's rally, it can no longer be said that Kohl's trades cheaper for better prospects. At today's levels, I'd either be neutral choosing between the two, or favor Apple. Conclusion The conclusion here is that not just can you compare different assets, but you should compare different assets. How else will you know which asset to choose to deploy your money on, if you don't compare them? How will you know which is the better investment , if you don't compare wildly different investment opportunities? As it turned out, my article comparing two such disparate investment opportunities did highlight a much better investment opportunity at the time. That was Kohl's, not Apple. Kohl's outperformance was massive over such a short period of time (6 months). Of course, since relative prices moved tremendously and prospects either didn't move (Kohl's) or improved for the competing investment (Apple), the value relationship has now changed. Kohl's no longer seems cheaper and with better prospects. Apple now does. If you're going to choose between the two, act accordingly.

      "text": "print \nHollis Johnson/Business Insider \nThe first batch of reviews for Apple's new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar are in, and they're mixed. \nIf you need a new laptop, are a Mac user, and have the money to spend, go ahead and buy the new MacBook Pro, my colleague Steve Kovach writes . \n\"The latest MacBook Pro model is slimmer, more powerful, and downright attractive,\" he wrote.\"It’s the best MacBook you can buy, but it’s also not for everyone.\" \nOther reviewers had issues with the laptop's battery life, next-generation Thunderbolt ports, and questioned the usefulness of the laptop's banner new feature, a touchscreen strip that replaces the function keys that Apple calls Touch Bar. \nThe new MacBook Pro comes in three main versions: one with a 13-inch screen without the Touch Bar touchscreen keyboard integration, one with a 13-inch screen and a Touch Bar, and one with a 15-inch screen and a Touch Bar. These reviews focus on the versions with the Touch Bar. \nHere's what tech pundits are saying about Apple's latest computer: View As: One Page Slides Joanna Stern, WSJ: \nSo how do you decide? Do you invest in the present—the “old” MacBook Pro with performance, good-enough portability, a keyboard to cherish and lots of ports? Or do you invest in the future—a beautiful, highly portable machine with new tricks? Or maybe you do what I’m doing: Stare down at your three-year-old laptop and wonder if you can tough it out another year or two while this sorts itself out. Walt Mossberg, The Verge: \nThe biggest surprise in my tests was just how inconsistent the Touch Bar Pro’s battery life was. I have tested hundreds of laptops over the years and Macs have almost always excelled at meeting or beating their promised battery lives, both in my longtime battery test regime, and in typical daily use. But the 13-inch MacBook Pro with Touch Bar wasn’t as reliably consistent as previous Macs. \nOn my rigorous test, which I’ve used for years, the machine actually exceeded Apple’s claim of up to 10 hours of battery life. The test involves setting the screen at 100 percent, keeping it on and undimmed constantly, playing an endless loop of music, and leaving Wi-Fi on to collect email, tweets, and Facebook posts in the background. Result: 11 hours and 38 minutes. \n... \nSo, my best advice is that even a mainstream, non-pro user can’t count on this laptop lasting the promised maximum of 10 hours — even in light to moderate use — let alone the 12 hour maximum a new Air can pull off. And you won’t have an accurate estimate to go by. Dana Wollman, Engadget: \nApple rates both the 13- and 15-inch MacBook Pro for up to 10 hours of battery life, and that's either with web surfing or iTunes movie playback. Even after half a dozen battery tests, I'm still noticing some inconsistencies in my results: 13-inch battery life is sometimes in the seven- to eight-hour range, with some tests hinting at a ten-and-a-half-hour capacity. Testing on the 15-inch model has also been inconclusive. I've generally seen between nine and 10 hours of video playback, but in one instance I exceeded the 13-hour mark by lowering the brightness slightly. I'll be conducting more tests and updating this review with final battery life results. Christina Warren, Gizmodo: \nAnd for now, that’s the problem with the Touch Bar: It’s not especially useful for either regular people or for the mythical “pros” the new MacBook line is supposedly designed for. The Touch Bar is most compelling for professionals, but these people live and die by their memorized shortcuts, so for now, the Bar isn’t not going to going to make a big impact. I don’t need Touch Bar in Photoshop because I’ve already memorized how to switch between the Heal and Lasso brushes. Yet the lack of usability for Apple’s former core market could change once third-party developers figure out how to create really customizable tooltips for the Touch Bar. \nFor now, the bigger win is Touch ID. Jan Dawson, Beyond Devices: \nThat’s not to say they’re all intended to be the only computer someone who uses heavy-duty creative apps needs – the Mac Pro and iMac are there at least in part to meet those needs. But these are computers that the vast majority of people who use a Mac for work would be fine to use as their only machine – that’s certainly the case for me. This 15″ version I’ve been testing is slightly less portable than the 13″ version, but can be significantly more powerful, and could handle pretty much any video or photo editing task you’d want to throw at it. Andrew Cunningham, Ars Technica: \nApple rates both the different 13-inch MacBook Pro models as having the same battery life on their product page, but in our review of the $1,499 model we noted a few factors that suggested otherwise. The $1,499 Pro has a lower-wattage processor and a battery that’s larger by 10 percent or so, for starters. \nOur battery testing bears this out. The Touch Bar-equipped Pro’s battery life is by no means bad, but it is quite a bit lower than the $1,499 MBP (and slightly lower than the 2015 MBP) in our light Wi-Fi Web browsing test. Lance Ulanoff, Mashable: \nApple built the Touch Bar as an open platform , one that any third party can program to (but not for web apps since there’s no HTML or Web API). There’s also no guarantee that companies like Google will ever write to it. In my tests, Chrome, obviously, has no interaction with the Touch Bar. I somehow doubt that Chrome will ever work with it, but its also clear that many other third-party developers will be happy to tap into the visual touch panel with the ability to accept up to 10 fingers of input at a time. Adobe has already committed to a Touch Bar-ready Photoshop by the end of this year and Touch Bar abilities are also coming to Microsoft Office, Pixelmator, 1Password and Live Home 3D. Dan Ackerman, CNET: \nIn the end , your decision may come down to something much more practical -- ports. Are you ready to move into the USB-C only future, where connecting a USB key, HDMI output, Ethernet cable, or nearly any other accessory will require a special cable or dongle? David Pierce, Wired: \nPeople love Apple computers because Apple gets the basics right. The keyboard, the trackpad, the screen, the speakers, all the table-stakes things too many companies get wrong. And in most cases, Apple made the best even better with the new MacBook Pro. Steve Kovach, Business Insider: \nThe upside is battery life on the MacBook is much better, so you likely won't need to charge it during the day. Apple says you'll get up to 10 hours per charge, but I didn't get that close. It was more like eight hours. (Although I tend to keep my screen brighter than most people.)",

      "text": "Find out more \nApple recently decided to cut its prices for its cables and dongles , acknowledging the fact that people need some time to transition to a future of connectivity that’s either fully wireless or defined by USB-C, but other manufacturers are also realizing the current business potential of the dongle market. \nThe Arc Hub looks like one of the best solutions for the MacBook Pro’s port problem yet. Its metal and glass design complement the laptop’s aesthetics well, and the seven ports it adds offer a generous fix. \nWhen connected to a MacBook through USB-C, it offers HDMI-out, Mini DisplayPort, an SD Card slot, two USB-C ports and two standard USB ports. At $104.99, the adapter is twice as expensive as Apple’s official USB-C Multiport dongle , but offers much more. Even though at a diameter of 9.5 cm it’s quite a big device to carry around all the time, it definitely offers a prettier solution than having Apple’s white block hanging from your laptop. \nYou can pre-order your own Hub on the website until December 31st, with the device scheduled to start shipping in early 2017.",

      "title": "Schiller: Apple tried touch screen MacBooks but doesn’t work for iMacs, landed on Touch Bar instead",
      "text": "Reddit \nDespite what companies like Microsoft may be doing and what some customers continue asking for, Apple is really confident that you wouldn’t like a touch screen on your MacBook. Here’s Phil Schiller explaining Apple’s view on touch screen Macs to Backchannel ‘s Steven Levy: \nApple came to this conclusion by testing if touch screens made sense on the Mac. “Our instincts were that it didn’t, but, what the heck, we could be wrong—so our teams worked on that for a number of times over the years,” says Schiller. “We’ve absolutely come away with the belief that it isn’t the right thing to do. Our instincts were correct.” \nOf course, Apple is slowly introducing multi-touch to Macs with the release of new MacBook Pros that replace function keys with a dynamic touch panel… \nThe reviews are starting to come in this morning and reception is mixed when it comes to the utility of the Touch Bar so far, and Schiller is confident that it’s the best approach for the notebook form factor. \n“Watch, iPhone, iPad, Macbook, iMac,” he said. “They really are all computers. Each one is offering customers something unique and each one is made with a simple form that perhaps is eternal. People in the industry may question them — we don’t, for some very simple reasons.” \nTranslation: don’t expect an iPad/MacBook hybrid anytime soon like Microsoft’s convertible Surface products. Part of the reason may be that Apple wants a unified experience between notebooks and desktops. \n“We think of the whole platform,” he says. “If we were to do Multi-Touch on the screen of the notebook, that wouldn’t be enough — then the desktop wouldn’t work that way.” And touch on the desktop, he says, would be a disaster. Can you imagine a 27-inch iMac where you have to reach over the air to try to touch and do things? That becomes absurd.” \nFor Microsoft’s part, they’re launching what they call the Surface Studio — a giant iMac-like touch screen display that lowers into a giant iPad-like panel for artists. Apple’s take is that you can’t design the desktop operating system to be best for both touch and mouse input. \nHe also explains that such a move would mean totally redesigning the menu bar for fingers, in a way that would ruin the experience for those using pointer devices like the touch or mouse. “You can’t optimize for both,” he says. “It’s the lowest common denominator thinking.” \nThe messaging for now seems clear: don’t expect the Touch Bar to creep up to the display any time soon (if ever); instead, I’d expect iPads to get more powerful and dynamic in form factor (like Smart Keyboard for example) as Apple’s answer to this request from customers. \nFor now, Touch Bar sounds more like Apple’s answer to a static row of function keys that may not get as much use as keys that could replace them. Multi-touch gestures on the trackpad may feel closer to touch — just not directly. \nSchiller’s reasoning here does suggest to me that iMacs will see the Touch Bar arrive in some form sooner or later. Can’t do touch screen MacBooks because it doesn’t work for iMacs, so Touch Bar can right? \nSchiller isn’t the only Apple exec to detail the company’s previous experimentation with touch screen MacBooks either. Craig Federighi hinted at the past experiments in recent interviews as well. Bottom line is don’t hold your breath on touch Macs in any form anytime soon if ever. \nSteve Jobs, of course, also spoke against the idea of touch screen Macs when selling the iPad: \nWe’ve done tons of user testing on this, and it turns out it doesn’t work. Touch surfaces don’t want to be vertical. It gives great demo but after a short period of time, you start to fatigue and after an extended period of time, your arm wants to fall off. it doesn’t work, it’s ergonomically terrible. Touch surfaces want to be horizontal, hence pads. Guides",

      "text": "Reddit \nWith both smartphone and PC sales plateauing, tech giants like Apple and Samsung are always looking for new markets. Apple of course made a big bet on music with its $3B acquisition of Beats , and Samsung is now making an even bigger play by announcing plans to buy U.S. automotive component maker Harman International. \nThe WSJ reports that the $8B deal will be the biggest one Samsung has ever struck, and it has more than a little in common with Apple’s purchase of Beats … \nHarman is best known for the audio brands it owns, covering both home and automotive markets. Harman brands include Harmon Kardon , Infinity , JBL , Lexicon and Mark Levinson . It also has a partnership with British audio specialists Bowers & Wilkins. \nHarman is also big in other forms of automotive tech , including embedded infotainment systems, connected safety and security systems, partnering with an impressive roster of car brands that include Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Ferrari, Porsche, Lamborghini, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, Chrysler, Jeep, Toyota, VW and more. \nThe company is additionally involved in corporate technology and the Internet of Things. \nAutomotive tech is arguably the market with the greatest potential for growth at present as the industry moves towards self-driving vehicles. This will not only drive demand for autonomous driving technology, but also means that in-car infotainment systems will become increasingly important as cars start doing the driving and their occupants need to find other ways to make use of the time spent travelling in them. \nIt won’t be Samsung’s first move into the automotive market. While the company’s car business is not well-known outside Asia, it partners with Renault and Nissan to make three different models that date back to 1998 but still sell today: the Samsung SM 3, SM 5 and SM 7 . \nIt looks unlikely that Samsung will be looking to follow Apple into the streaming music business, however. Its previous attempt at a streaming music service, Samsung Milk , lasted just 18 months before it was discontinued . Guides",

      "text": "Apple’s iPhone and iPad could deliver some major improvements next year, analysts say.\nThe tech giant’s next iPhone, which could be known as the iPhone 8, will ship with bigger screen sizes, Barclays analysts Blayne Curtis and Christopher Hemmelgarn said in a note this week. They say the iPhone 8 will offer a 5-inch screen and iPhone 8 Plus will deliver a 5.8-inch display, according to Business Insider, which obtained a copy of the note. The iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus offer 4.7- and 5.5-inch screen sizes.\nThe larger screens would be offered if Apple decides to offer a “bezel-less design” in the iPhone 8, according to the report. Rather than stop the screen before the left and right edges, Apple is expected to offer a design that has the iPhone 8’s display spill over the sides, creating an end-to-end touch surface. On the left and right side, the iPhone 8’s screen would curve, similar to the “edges” in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge.\nIn order to deliver that feature, the iPhone 8 will need to ship with organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen technology. It would be the first from Apple to offer OLED. All iPhone versions through the iPhone 7 have run on LCD technology.\n“By using a plastic OLED screen, the screen can bend at the edges to allow a curved bezel-less edge,” the analysts reportedly told investors.\nTheir comments come after several rumors have surfaced saying Apple is working on an OLED-based curved screen. However, Apple has yet to even confirm it’s working on a new smartphone , let alone new display technology, and the analysts acknowledged that the company hasn’t yet made a final decision on the next iPhone’s screen. But evidence suggests Apple’s next iPhone will come with a big display update.\nIn regards to Apple’s iPad, the analysts said that the company will release new tablets in March. Like the iPhone, the new iPads are expected to come with a “bezel-less” design and offer displays that stretch from one side to another. The 9.7-inch model would become the “low-price” version and complement the higher-end 12.9-inch iPad Pro. What’s more, Apple could announce a new 10.9-inch iPad that would feature the bezel-less design.\nApple currently sells 7.9-, 9.7- and 12.9-inch versions of its iPad. Some had anticipated Apple updating the tablets this year, but the company focused instead on a new iPhone and new MacBook Pro.\nThere is some debate over when a bezel-less iPad might surface. Although the Barclays analysts say it’s only a matter of months, a KGI Securities analyst said in a research note recently that Apple likely wouldn’t offer OLED and thus, a curved display, in the iPad until 2018.\nApple hasn’t confirmed any of the rumors and did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\nThis article originally appeared on Fortune.com ",

      "title": "China Threatens to Cut iPhone Sales Over Trump Rhetoric",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump’s threats against China and its policies could ultimately hurt Apple , the Chinese government said on Monday.\nThe Global Times, a state-run news agency in China, on Monday issued its strongest rebuke of Trump and his policies, saying that if he “wrecks Sino-U.S. trade,” several U.S. industries could be “impaired.” The news outlet, which called Trump “naive,” signaled Apple’s AAPL iPhone sales could be targeted by the Chinese government.\n“China will take a tit-for-tat approach then,” the Global Times threatens in its editorial. “A batch of Boeing orders will be replaced by Airbus. U.S. auto and iPhone sales in China will suffer a setback, and U.S. soybean and maize imports will be halted. China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the U.S.”\nTrump was one of the most outspoken critics of trade with China during the protracted Presidential campaign. He said on numerous occasions that China was acting unfairly in its trade dealings with the U.S. and said he would label the government as a “currency manipulator” when he becomes President. Trump said earlier this year that he could impose expensive tariffs on Chinese imports and has called the Chinese government the world’s biggest thief.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nWhile China has not said that it will definitely engage in activities that could hurt American companies, there’s little stopping it from doing so. China, after all, has an iron-like grip on the trade in its country and has banned several American companies from its borders, including Google , Facebook, and others. Limiting sales on iPhones, then, wouldn’t be much of a stretch.\nFor affected companies, China trouble could be disconcerting. The country has a massive middle class that’s anxiously demanding the latest and greatest products. American companies have generated massive sums of revenue in the country despite trade regulations and continue to believe China will be critical to their growth and profit in the future.\nApple, one of the companies China cited in its editorial on Monday, last quarter generated nearly $9 billion in revenue in the country. While that figure was down 30% year-over-year , during an earnings call with investors and analysts, CEO Tim Cook said he believes China will continue to play an integral role in his company’s operation in the coming years.\nAmerican presidents have for years criticized China for some of its trade policies, but none have gone so far as to impose the expensive tariff on the country’s goods Trump has floated. Trump, though, has said that he would be acting in the best interests of the American people by taking a tougher stance against China.\nFor more about Apple’s iPhone 7, watch: \nThere has been some debate over how much influence a President Trump could actually have over trade between the countries. Even the Global Times acknowledged that in its editorial, saying that even a President Trump “can exert limited influence” on what it believes is a mutually beneficial and “win-win” relationship for both countries.\nStill, the Global Times ends its editorial with a prediction on how Trump could be viewed if he engages in a trade war with China, questioning if the U.S. media is attempting to bait Trump into a mistake.\n“The new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences,” the Global Times predicts, adding it’s “very suspicious the trade war scenario is a trap set up by some American media to trip up the new president.”",

      "text": "Live Is The New MacBook Pro With TouchBar A Good Computer? Courtesy of Apple OR ARE THEY OUT OF TOUCH? Is The New MacBook Pro With TouchBar A Good Computer? Nov 14 2016, 3:32 PM digg Blacklist story Blacklist domain Today, the brand new MacBook Pro with TouchBar, which was unveiled just a few weeks ago , arrives in the hands of the consumer. It's also the day that, evidently, the review embargo was lifted. So, is a computer with a touchscreen worth $1,799? Here's what the reviews say. Is The TouchBar Actually Useful? As its name suggests, the MacBook Pro with TouchBar comes with a thin multi-touch LED screen where the function keys used to be. Gimmick or not, the TouchBar's ability to display context-sensitive actions for whatever application you're using is one of the few hardware interface experiments in the PC industry. But does it actually work? According to The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes it does... almost : The Touch Bar is often used like a menu, rather than a quick set of controls. Having those menu options exposed so clearly can be helpful at times — I’m bad at finding formulas in Keynote, for instance, and the Touch Bar makes them easy to access — but mostly it’s not. These apps don’t need more menus; they need better context for people just starting out in them, and a streamlined way for experienced users to get stuff done. [ The Verge ] Ars Technica's Andrew Cunningham points out that the utility of the TouchBar lies squarely in the hands of the developers. Sure, it works in Apple's own apps, but outside of that you're likely to forget the TouchBar even exists: The ultimate utility of the Touch Bar is going to depend entirely on the apps you use and, to a lesser extent, how you use your computer. If it’s being used as a desktop with an external keyboard a significant amount of the time, the Touch Bar does nothing for you. When I went out of my way to use Apple’s apps, I liked the Touch Bar a lot. It just takes one or two useful buttons—creating a new tab in Safari, looking up a main page in Terminal, changing font sizes or creating checklists in Notes—to make you glad the Touch Bar is there. However, a typical day for me is spent mostly in Word, Outlook, Slack, Tweetbot, and Chrome. Microsoft is bringing Touch Bar support to Office, but if other app makers don’t start adding in support, a big chunk of that bar is going to end up sitting empty most of the time. [ Ars Technica ] Based on the impressions of CNET's Dan Ackerman, who seems to really enjoy the TouchBar, at best it'll make your life a little easier here and there but won't totally change the way you use a compute r: Having spent some serious hands-on time with the Touch Bar version of the new 13-inch MacBook Pro, and testing its capabilities with a wide range of apps, it feels like a tool that can enhance your computing experience, but won't revolutionize it. It does less than a full touchscreen might, but Apple has found a way to use it to cut down on keystrokes, streamline tasks and add additional levels of fine control. [ CNET ] The Port Situation Is A Hassle Perhaps you've heard some frustrated criticisms of Apple's Decision to equip the MacBook Pro with just four USB-C ports. There is no MagSafe charging port. There is no DisplayPort. There is, as the gaming bros over at Razer pointed out, no SD card slot. Just four USB-C slots and a whole mess of dongles. The Wall Street Journal's Joanna Stern explains , like the loss of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, the switch to USB-C is necessary in the long run, but annoying today: USB-C is a wonderful port. A faster, single type of port for connecting chargers, hard drives, phones, monitors? It’s the dream.Today, though, it’s a dongle nightmare. Until the entire tech industry catches up, you’re stuck dragging around pricey, flimsy adapters to connect everything. Apple has slashed USB-C adapter pricing for now, but it should have included that $9 USB-C to USB adapter in the box [ The Wall Street Journal ] The Keyboard Is A Bit Odd But The Speakers Are Good Apple completely redesigned the MacBook Pro to be both thinner and lighter. This quest for doing more with less has it's winners and losers, however. To save space, Apple opted for its shorter-travel butterfly key design, originally found on the MacBook. For Endgadget's Dana Wollman, who was very familiar with the older, softer keys, they new butterfly design took a few weeks to stick : Though Apple claims the butterfly mechanism allows for more even button presses, my key strikes would sometimes fail to register, leading me to make typos and forcing me to go back and reenter my long password a second or even third time.By now, though, after some two-odd weeks of testing, I'm typing at a faster clip. I still sometimes screw up my passwords, but my emails and first drafts (including this review!) are mostly clean. I've gone from merely tolerating the new keyboard to actually appreciating it. [ Endgadget ] Somehow, the thinner design brought us better speakers? According to Macworld's Susie Ochs, they're on-par with a Bluetooth speaker : What isn’t a bummer are the new speakers, my favorite non-Touch Bar feature of the new machines. Apple explained that since they are connected right to the battery with no transformer between them, the speakers can get twice the peak power—and you can really hear the difference. Music sounds great when you turn the volume all the way up, and the speakers are powerful enough to provide satisfying sound while watching movies, TV, and sports. The 15-inch model’s speakers seem to have more oomph than the 13-incher’s, but both can ably fill a hotel room with music, if you should want to leave your portable Bluetooth speaker at home. [ Macworld ] It's Powerful Enough A major gripe within those who have an eye for hardware specs is that Apple neglected to include Intel's newest processor, their fifth-generation Broadwell CPU, and instead opted for the fourth-gen Haswell. A curious omission for what Apple calls it's most powerful MacBook yet. Still, practically speaking, not being on the bleeding edge doesn't seems okay? It's fine, says Fast Company's Harry McCracken : Given that some of Apple's most demanding professional users are fretting about these machines' processors and RAM capacities, should those of us who don't need tippy-top-of-the-line performance be concerned? I'll leave benchmarking to experts such as the folks at AnandTech , but these Macs have more than enough horsepower for non-superhuman computing tasks; even though Apple didn't use Intel's latest processors, it called on technologies such as high-speed solid-state storage to keep things fast. [ Fast Company ] Ultimately, It Might Be Good To Just Wait A TouchBar developers have yet to quite figure out, an I/O port standard that's still in its infancy, a slightly underwhelming choice of processor — there are a few teething issues with the new MacBrook Pro. And for a minimum $1,799 entry fee, well, that's an iffy proposition. WIRED's David Pierce suggests that, like the original iPhone, it might be better to just wait for the second go-round : Do you desperately need a new laptop right this second? If not, wait. Run your current (and probably still excellent) machine into the ground, then buy a new one. In a year or two USB-C accessories will be everywhere, developers will have figured out what the Touch Bar is good for, and Apple may even give the Pro spec bump.",

China can also limit the number of Chinese students studying in the US.\"\n\nThe publication also points out that a U.S. president can only increase tariffs on all imported products from any country for 15 percent over 150 days. Higher tariffs must specify which goods in detail, such as President Obama's 35 percent tariff on Chinese tires in 2009.\n\n\"If Trump wrecks Sino-US trade, a number of US industries will be impaired,\" said the editorial. \"Finally the new president will be condemned for his recklessness, ignorance and incompetence and bear all the consequences.\"\n\nAccording to other Chinese media, President-Elect Trump spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping on Monday, with the two men promising to meet \"at an early date.\"\n\nGearing up for a battle with China, and U.S. businesses \n\nIn January, Trump promised that he would force Apple to manufacture its hardware in the US instead of utilizing to overseas labor, and proposed a 35 percent tax on businesses making goods overseas, rather than by U.S factories.\n\nApple manufactures the Mac Pro in Austin, Texas. The remainder of Apple's products are manufactured in China , and potentially India in the days to come.\n\nPoints 5 through 7 of Trump's \" 7 point plan to rebuild the American economy by fighting for free trade\" could be considered hostile to China's interests.\n\nIn the plan, Trump declares that in the first 100 days of office, the treasury secretary will be directed to label China a currency manipulator, and the trade representative to China will bring trade cases against China specifically addressing unfair subsidy behavior.\n\nPoint 7 of the plan promises to bring to bear \"every lawful presidential power to remedy trade disputes if China does not stop its illegal activities.\"",

      "text": "show chapters \nSamsung buys Harman for $8B\nCNBC's Carl Quintanilla reports the latest on Samsung agreeing to buy Harman International for $8 billion in cash, making it the biggest-ever overseas acquisition by a South Korean Company. \nSamsung buys Harman for $8B      1 Hour Ago | 06:05 Apple should have scooped up car tech firm Harman International before Samsung did, says CNBC's Jim Cramer. Harman agreed to be bought by the tech giant's rival for $8 billion on Monday. \n\"I pushed (Apple CEO) Tim Cook ,\" Cramer said on \" Squawk on the Street \" Monday. \"I did a Google search of how many times I said they should buy Harman. It was kind of embarrassing because every single one the Harman listings was 'Cramer to Apple: Buy Harman.'\" \nSamsung's agreement to buy the U.S. firm — best known for making car audio systems — marks a major push for the company to enter the automotive electronics market. The tech company had created an automotive electronic business group a year ago to help identify growth opportunities in the sector. \nThe deal also comes as Samsung's smartphone business took a hit from its Galaxy Note 7 recall. \nCramer said he continuously pressed Apple to buy the firm because he believed the company's select-vehicle asset CarPlay, available in models such as Acura, Audi and BMWs, wasn't powerful enough. \n\"You want to be the center of infotainment,\" he said, \"which they've now brought it into the center for yes, cyber-security [and] autonomous cars.\" \n—Reuters contributed to this report. \nDisclosure: Jim Cramer's charitable trust owns shares of Apple.",

      "text": "Why Nintendo, Apple Are Poised To Have A Bigger Christmas Than You May Think November 14, 2016, 08:22:33 AM EDT By Chris Ciaccia Shutterstock photo \nIn September 2016, Super Mario decided to go down a tube in Japan and wind up on an iPhone in Cupertino, California. \nNow, both the beloved plumber with the red hat and overalls and the iconic smartphone maker are poised to have record setting sales this holiday season. But there's more to this relationship than meets the eye. \nTwo companies, worlds apart, have never had their futures more intertwined than they are now, as Nintendo and Apple ( AAPL ) are now venerably linked at the hip -- or chip, I should say. \nSince Nintendo announced Super Mario Run would be coming to the iPhone in December, more than 20 million people have signed up for notifications when the game will be announced. That number seems likely to grow as the game gets closer to launch and Nintendo actually announces the launch date and pricing. \nApple, for owning the App Store, will get its custom 30% cut of whatever revenue is generated from the game. Assuming no growth from that 20 million figure -- which is hard to believe -- and an average revenue per user (ARPU) of $10 from the game, Nintendo stands to make $170 million in revenue and Apple $30 million -- not huge amounts for either company, but not exactly nothing, either. \nGiven the success of Pokemon Go, which has been downloaded more than 500 million times, it's a good bet that a character as popular as Mario is likely to be downloaded significantly more than 20 million times from a user base of over 1 billion devices. \nIn addition, Nintendo is also likely to benefit from the increase buzz around the company because of Pokemon Go, Super Mario Run and its latest console, the Nintendo Switch. The announcement of Nintendo Classic Edition was met with considerable excitement earlier this year and reviews of the system have been nothing short of astounding. \nFor $60, people can relive their childhood and play 30 classic games such as the Super Mario Bros. series, Donkey Kong , Tecmo Bowl and a host of others. Gizmodo called it \"a great gift\" and said unboxing it almost made the author cry. \nFor Apple's sake, the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus have been more well received than anyone in the media and on Wall Street anticipated. This goes back to brand cache, something both Apple and Nintendo have in spades. \nApple refreshed nearly its entire product line in the past few months, from the iPhone to the iPad to the MacBook Pro. Apple's legions of fans, despite some harsh criticism surrounding the new MacBook Pro laptops, have been buying its products faster than Apple and its partners can make them. \nA look on Apple's website shows the new MacBook Pros with Touch Bar and TouchID have longer than usual shipping dates. The iPhone 7 Plus in Jet Black, which seems to be the most desirable of the new lot, still has a shipping date of 3-5 weeks nearly two months after it announced. \nThat's a good sign for a company that has struggled to grow revenue in recent quarters. \nBoth companies have a history of secretiveness and have been around and more importantly, relevant, for nearly 40 years in technology -- a feat that isn't easily done. Both have reinvented themselves multiple times, have had iconic figure heads and are beloved by millions. \nWith the two companies working relationship seemingly getting closer than ever, it's not hard to see why as the fortune of one company goes, the other may follow. \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

      "text": "Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nThe new MacBook Pro is a great laptop, but its battery life falls short of Apple's claims.\nOn Apple's specs sheet for the new MacBook Pro, the company says the laptop gets up to 10 hours of use on a single battery charge. But in my tests with the 13-inch model with Touch Bar, I only got about eight hours if I kept the screen brightness at a lower level. I got a little over six hours with the brightness all the way up, my preferred setting.\nOther reviewers had similar experiences. The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes wrote that he only got about five or six hours of battery life per charge .\nBeyond the obvious disappointment, this is also a bummer because Apple removed the clever MagSafe charger from the MacBook Pro in favor of the new Thunderbolt 3 port. The MagSafe charger magnetically connected to the computer so it wouldn't ruin anything if your tripped over it. The Thunderbolt charger fits snugly inside the port and doesn't pop out as easily as MagSafe chargers.\nHollis Johnson/Business Insider \nIt's also a major twist for Apple, which tends to understate battery life specs for MacBooks and then surprise everyone when the device exceeds expectations. For example, Apple says the MacBook Air gets up to 12 hours of battery life, but many found it can get up to 14 hours.\nNOW WATCH: Here’s your first look at the ‘Touch Bar’ — the biggest change coming to the MacBook Pro \n",

      "text": "Hollis Johnson/Business Insider \nThe new MacBook Pro is a great laptop, but its battery life falls short of Apple's claims. \nOn Apple's specs sheet for the new MacBook Pro, the company says the laptop gets up to 10 hours of use on a single battery charge. But in my tests with the 13-inch model with Touch Bar, I only got about eight hours if I kept the screen brightness at a lower level. I got a little over six hours with the brightness all the way up, my preferred setting. \nOther reviewers had similar experiences. The Verge's Jacob Kastrenakes wrote that he only got about five or six hours of battery life per charge . \nBeyond the obvious disappointment, this is also a bummer because Apple removed the clever MagSafe charger from the MacBook Pro in favor of the new Thunderbolt 3 port. The MagSafe charger magnetically connected to the computer so it wouldn't ruin anything if your tripped over it. The Thunderbolt charger fits snugly inside the port and doesn't pop out as easily as MagSafe chargers. \nBattery specs for the 13-inch MacBook Pro (left) and 15-inch MacBook Pro (right). Apple \nIt's also a major twist for Apple, which tends to understate battery life specs for MacBooks and then surprise everyone when the device exceeds expectations. For example, Apple says the MacBook Air gets up to 12 hours of battery life, but many found it can get up to 14 hours.",

      "title": "Apple Watch Series 2",
      "text": "Apple Watch Series 2 Apple Watch Series 2 The Apple Watch Series 2 brings advanced fitness-tracking features that make it more than just a smartwatch. But it's still a considerable investment for a device you don't really need. Editor Rating: Excellent (4.0) Waterproof. Faster. Special Nike version. Lots of third-party apps for a watch. Plays Pokemon Go. Cons Still expensive. Still iOS only. Bottom Line Apple's Series 2 smartwatch still looks better than its competitors, and new fitness features may attract runners. Nov. 14, 2016 PC Mag ME Team \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 (starting at $369) is the closest we've come to a genuine smartwatch - fitness tracker hybrid yet. In addition to a faster processor and a brighter screen than the original model, the Series 2 has a waterproof design for swimmers, and built-in GPS so runners can leave their iPhones at home. It's a lot more expensive than a Pebble, and fitness features aren't quite as advanced as you'll get with some dedicated trackers, but it's a solid choice for iOS users looking for the best of both worlds. That said, it still isn't a must-have device. Pricing and Models \nThe Series 2 comes in the same sizes as the original Apple Watch . The 38mm model (starting at $369) measures 1.5 by 1.3 by 0.4 inches (HWD), while the 42mm version (starting at $399) is 1.7 by 1.4 by 0.4 inches. \nIt looks the same as the original too, though Apple has added a ceramic case option (starting at $1,249) in addition to aluminum or stainless steel; Apple says the ceramic is four times tougher than the steel. The ceramic watch is slightly different in size, at 1.5 by 1.3 by 0.5 inches and 1.6 by 1.4 by 0.4 inches for the 38mm and 42mm models, respectively. \nThere's also the Apple Watch Nike+ , which starts at $369 for the 38mm model and $399 for the 42mm version. Both are made of aluminum (no stainless steel or ceramic options here), with sporty color combinations including Black/Volt (screaming neon yellow), Black/Cool Gray, Flat Silver/White, and Flat Silver/Volt. Its strap is made of the same strong elastomer silicone as Apple's Sport band, but it's perforated for better ventilation as you sweat. The Nike model also includes exclusive watch faces and Siri commands, and the Nike Run Club app is built-in and accessible right from the home screen. \nThere's one more new model, sort of: the Apple Watch Series 1. It replaces the original Apple Watch, and is basically the same hardware as the Series 2, but without the brighter screen, built-in GPS, and waterproofing. It starts at $269. \nWe tested a $399 42mm Series 2 model with a black aluminum case and Sport View All 14 Photos in Gallery Design \nAs you can see (above), Apple once again opts for a square look with the Series 2, whereas a lot of the competition, like the Samsung Gear S3 and the Asus ZenWatch 3 , go the more traditional circular route. I find Apple's design attractive, and like that it stands out a bit. It's also very comfortable, to the point that I could sleep with it on without it being a bother. \nYou'll find the rotating Digital Crown on the right; pushing it in twice opens up the main app screen, while rotating it zooms in or out, scrolls, and inputs data depending on the screen you're looking at. Next to the Digital Crown is the simply named Side Button. It wakes the watch up, powers it on and off when held down, pulls up the Dock (more on that in a bit), and sends an SOS alert. On the left side you'll find two tiny slots for the speakers, and two pinholes for the microphone. Underneath, you'll see metallic charging contacts and tiny buttons on either side that you push to slide off the swappable band. \nInside the box, you get the watch itself, a metallic charging cradle, a power adapter, and large and small bands. Display \nThe Series 2 has an OLED Retina touch display, just like the original, but it's twice as bright, at 1,000 nits compared with the original's 450. That's bright enough to light your way in a dark room, and it's easily viewable in direct sunlight. The 38mm and 42mm models have a resolution of 272-by-340 and 312-by-390 pixels, respectively, just like the original. That works out to just over 300 pixels per inch ( ppi ) for the 42mm model. Images, text, and video all look nice and sharp. It's even better than the the 400-by-400-pixel, 286ppi display on the Huawei Watch . \nForce Touch is back, which means you can push hard on the display to activate different functions depending on the app or screen that's open. If you're on the watch face, for example, you can press down and then cycle through the other faces available. In Twitter, Force Touching brings up the screen to compose a new Tweet. \nThe display isn't always on, which means it blinks off when you put your wrist down or when you're not doing anything on the watch for around 10 seconds. By contrast, the Pebble Time and the forthcoming Samsung Gear S3 are always on, which is convenient when you're glancing at your wrist for the time. Waterproofing and Battery Life \nYou can take the Series 2 down to 164 feet underwater. Apple cautions that it shouldn't be used for scuba diving or waterskiing. You can swim with it, though, and use it to track swimming stats including calories burned, distance traveled, pace, and strokes. That puts it on par with waterproof fitness trackers like our Editors' Choice, the Garmin Forerunner 735XT . \nAn impressive new mechanism in the watch's speaker ejects any water that finds its way inside. You'll know it's time to remove liquid when you see a water drop icon at the top of the display. When that happens, simply rotate the side dial, wait, and watch liquid sputter out of the speaker port, accompanied by a mechanical whirring sound. I wore the Series 2 in the pool, shower, and submerged it under the faucet every chance I got, and only had to eject water twice. To dry it, all you have to do is give it a shake and wipe the excess water off. \nYou can't use the touch screen underwater, and it can be difficult to swipe through app screens with wet fingers. The Garmin Forerunner 735XT, by comparison, has buttons you can easily press to cycle through exercise data. \nBattery life is the same as the original Apple Watch, at about 18 hours. That basically means you'll be recharging the watch every night; I managed to get through most days with just under 20 percent of battery life left. You need to use the included magnetic charging cable to juice up the Series 2's rechargeable lithium-ion battery. That can be frustrating if you want to want to track your sleep at night and you only have a sliver of battery life left. By comparison, Fitbit devices like the Blaze last about five days on a full charge. \nWith GPS enabled, your battery life estimate drops to five hours, which is enough for a short marathon. The Fitbit Surge also lasts about five hours with GPS on, while the Garmin Forerunner 735XT lasts up to 14 hours. WatchOS 3 and Features \nYou need an iPhone 5 or later to pair with the Apple Watch Series 2. (Sorry, Android users.) To pair, download or open the Apple Watch app on your iPhone, open it, and follow the simple instructions. I paired the Series 2 with an Apple iPhone 6 Plus for this review. It takes a few minutes for the pairing process to complete. Once connected, the watch automatically syncs with your mobile device whenever it's in range. \nThe Series 2 ships with watchOS 3, which includes several new features like a Dock screen for quick access to your favorite apps, the ability to handwrite messages on the screen, additional watch faces, and SOS functionality to alert emergency contacts to your location or dial 911. Original Apple Watch users can download and install the new software for free. \nThe Dock is accessed by pressing the Side Button. It's basically a screen where you can flip through apps you've already opened, which appear as little cards in a horizontal line. You can swipe through and open apps from there rather than using the tiny bubble interface on the home screen, which is convenient. \nApps can now run in the background. I kept BBC News, Twitter, and the heart rate monitor open at the same time, which means you don't need to wait for them to load each time you switch from one to the other. \nAs far as handwriting messages goes , the actual process takes a while—you can only scribble one letter or symbol at a time—but it's a nice addition to have. Otherwise, you can speak into the microphone to compose your text, and access the usual array of emojis. \nWatch faces are pretty standard. There are 14 to choose from, which you can customize with battery life, fitness, and weather widgets. For example, you can add a heart icon you can tap whenever you want to take your pulse. But there are only so many variations you can make before feeling like there should be a more interesting selection of faces available. Pebble's store has numerous watch faces you can download, including some fun ones based on BB-8 and Metal Gear Solid V . You can't download additional faces for the Apple Watch. \nSiri is always listening, so you only need to say \"Hey Siri\" to trigger voice control. For instance, you can say, \"Hey Siri, set an alarm for 7:30,\" and the watch will open the alarm app with the set time. Siri also works with some HomeKit-enabled smart home devices, including Philips Hue lights, which you can turn on and off with your voice, or open the app to select lighting scenes. \nOf course, the Series 2 can also display caller ID information, calendar reminders, social media notifications, and text messages, provided your phone is nearby. \nApple's third-party app selection is still the one to beat. You can read headlines with BBC News, CNN, and New York Times apps, order cabs with Uber, send, reply, like, and compose Tweets with Twitter, contact colleagues with Slack, and navigate with Google Maps. And don't forget Pokemon Go , which will soon be available in Apple Watch form. As we've seen with the iPhone, many smartwatch apps tend to come to the Apple Watch first—and better—than they do for other platforms. Fitness Tracking and Performance \nThe Series 2 uses a new dual-core S2 processor that Apple says is twice the speed of the original's S1 chip, with a GPU that can deliver 50 percent faster performance. It's difficult to benchmark a smartwatch, but as far as I can tell, performance is snappy. Apps open in less time that the original, and motions feel fast and fluid. \nAs far as sensors go, the watch has an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a heart rate monitor, just like the original. The addition of built-in GPS makes the Series 2 a good choice for athletes (particularly runners), and for the most part, it works very well. \nThe GPS locked onto a satellite instantly in testing, which is impressive considering most fitness trackers like the Fitbit Surge and TomTom Spark Cardio + Music can take a minute or two to dial in. Using GPS, you can leave your iPhone at home when you go for a run and still get accurate distance and pace stats, as well as maps of your route. \nI wore the Garmin Forerunner 735XT at the same time that I wore the Series 2 for several jogs, and they both returned similar results, complete with the exact same map of my route. Distance, steps, and heart rate measurements were also comparable. The same goes for when I compared it with the Fitbit Charge 2. All three devices were ever only five to 10 BPMs or steps higher or lower, which is an acceptable level of deviation. \nThe Apple Activity app is pretty helpful. It gives you a nice breakdown of active minutes, calories burned, distance traveled, steps, and progress made, depending on the activity, all on the same screen. But it's not as detailed as Garmin's app, which gives you more info like average speed, cadence, maximum speed, and maximum heart rate. You won't see elevation in Apple's app either, which you can see in apps from Garmin and Fitbit. \nThe Apple Watch doesn't continuously monitor your heart rate , like the Fitbit Charge 2 and some other dedicated fitness trackers. As mentioned, you can choose a watch face with a shortcut widget to the heart rate screen, but then you have to stand or sit still and wait for it to take a measurement. The only way to continuously measure BPMs on the Series 2 is by starting a workout. \nThere's also no integrated sleep tracking. For that you need a third-party app, and as mentioned, the meager battery life means you'll probably be recharging it every night anyway. \nAs for a fitness community, Apple doesn't really have one. Fitbit has the largest number of users when it comes to fitness devices, so if it's camaraderie and challenges you're looking for, you'll probably want to consider a tracker like the Blaze or Charge 2. Comparisons and Conclusions \nThe Apple Watch Series 2 is the best smartwatch-fitness tracker hybrid we've seen, and better than the original watch thanks to a brighter screen, faster performance, and a waterproof design. \nIf you're already sold on the Series 2 but want something even more runner-specific, check out the Apple Watch Nike+, with its exclusive watch faces, Siri commands, and built-in Nike app. If you aren't interested in the fitness features, the Apple Watch Series 1 will save you $100 while still giving you access to Apple's excellent third-party app selection. And if you already own the original Apple Watch, I wouldn't recommend upgrading to the Series 2 unless you want to take it swimming. \nFrom left to right: Garmin Forerunner 735XT, original Apple Watch, Apple Watch Series 2, Fitbit Charge 2 \nTriathletes who need more than five hours of GPS-enabled tracking should look at the Garmin Forerunner 735XT. If tracking calories, heart rate, and steps is all you care about, the much less expensive Fitbit Charge 2 is the way to go, and it can also push phone notifications like caller ID and texts. \nAnd if you want a smartwatch you can use with an Android phone , the Samsung Gear S2 Classic and Pebble Time are PCMag favorites. The Gear S2 doesn't have nearly the app selection the Apple Watch does, but its unique rotating bezel and Tizen OS make it easier to navigate than any other smartwatch. The Pebble Time is less expensive, has a robust app selection, a week of battery life, and it's compatible with both Android and iOS devices. \nAlso worth considering, the Pebble 2 + Heart Rate ($129.99) adds a lot of fitness functionality, such as sleep and step tracking. The $199.99 Pebble Time 2, due in January, does the same, along with a brighter, sharper display. Both watches feature built-in heart rate monitors, but not GPS. For the price, they're definitely worth a look. \nAnd you can't ignore price. For $369 (or more), the Apple Watch Series 2 still doesn't offer any must-have features or functionality. Sure, it's a fun gadget for iPhone users with big budgets, but if you forget to put it on in the morning, your day probably won't be much different. That's an issue with smartwatches in general, but for nearly $400, it isn't unreasonable to expect a bit more. So while the Apple Watch Series 2 is definitely an improvement over the original, you don't need to rush out and buy one quite yet.",

      "text": "Reddit The new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar will be available at Apple retail stores later this week alongside demo units for customers to try, according to sources familiar with Apple’s plans. Apple’s new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar has up until now only been available to order with a 4-5 week shipping estimate from Apple’s website, but this week the device will arrive at retail stores as the first shipments are delivered to pre-order customers . So far Apple has only had the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models displayed under glass with a demo loop, but this week customers should also be able to get their hands on demo units to try for themselves in at least some locations. Apple retail stores are expected to receive shipments of the new MacBook Pros early this week with the first demo units and available stock planned to go out by Thursday. Some stores will also have demo units of the LG UltraFine 4K and 5K displays that Apple unveiled with the new MacBooks and will sell exclusively from its stores beginning early next month. Apple is already selling a 4K version of the display that currently ships in 5-6 weeks, and it recently announced limited time pricing on both models as well as temporary price cuts to its USB-C accessories that some new MacBook Pro users might need. It’s unclear how many stores and in which markets will have stock of the new device, but at least some of Apple’s flagship locations in the US are expecting to have units for sale. While the first pre-order shipments started arriving to customers today, at the time of writing the new MacBook Pro with Touch Bar models are still listed with a 4-5 week shipping estimate from Apple’s website. Earlier today the first round of official reviews surfaced online ahead of the retail launch scheduled for later this week. Guides",

The technology giant is about to reveal the latest innovation of the iconic iPad, and release a model which will feature the largest screen in Apple history. Advertisement \nExpress says Apple's iPad series has been left-out as the technology giant focused on the development and marketing of its iPhones and MacBooks. But for a company made famous by its brilliant innovations, it seems like Apple has a game plan. \nWe may recall Parent Herald's article on the rumored specs and updates of the upcoming iPad Mini 5. Rumors now claim that Apple is about to relaunch the iPad Pro series in the most incredible built ever. Three new iPad models, each piece remodeled to feature the latest innovations in the iPad history. \nApple's new iPad line-up includes three models with unique and innovative features. Speculations claim that the first model will be Apple's biggest iPad yet, which will come with an enormous 12.9 inches display. \nThe largest iPad will be backed up by two other straightforward iPad Pro models which will come in a 9.7 inches and 10.9 inches respectively. The 10.9 inch-model is rumored to launch Apple's bezel-free feature where the iPad's screen entirely takes over the front display. \nWith the bezel-free design of Apple, the 10.9-inch model will level with the physical measures of the existing current generation 9.7-inch iPad Pro models. \nRumors drop even more interesting updates on Apple's new toys. Upgrades include the installation of quad microphones which will give the iPads a major sound quality boost. Also, the new iPads will retain the 3.5mm headphone jacks that were removed from the latest iPhone installment. \nSpeculations further claim that the new iPad models will feature Apple's latest technologies that were patented early in 2015. These include ultrasonic imaging that is more advanced than the current fingerprint sensors. \nStay updated for more news on Apple's latest iPads.

      "text": "11/14/16 AT 11:14 AM Close \nApple dropped a bombshell last October when it announced three new MacBook Pros and not a single upgrade for its MacBook Air line. In addition, it decided to end the 11-inch MacBook Air series and to simply move forward with the unchanged 13-inch MacBook Air. What’s worse is that the 13-inch Air now internally competes with the MacBook Pro without Touch Bar for market attention. If you are wondering which Apple laptop is better between the two, this comparison review can help you decide. \nPerformance \nOn paper, the 13-inch MacBook Pro without Touch Bar easily trumps the 13-inch MacBook Air because the former comes with either a 2.0GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.4GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor with Turbo Boost technology that can speed up the cores for up to 3.4GHz. On the other hand, the the 13-inch MacBook Air only comes with either a 1.6GHz dual-core Intel Core i5 processor or a 2.2GHz dual-core Intel Core i7 processor. When Turbo Boost kicks in, the Air’s cores can speed up to 3.2GHz. Both have 8GB of RAM, so the two devices are expected to do well in handling multiple tasks. \nWhen it comes to their tested performance, their Geekbench ratings also show the significant difference on the performance they can deliver. The Core i5 MacBook Air has a single-core score of 2624 and a multi-core score of 5210, while the Core i7 got 3019 and 6320, respectively. Contrariwise, the new MacBook Pro with Core i5 processor has a 3600 single-core score and a 6998 multi-core score. The Core i7 variant, meanwhile, scored 3817 and 7501 for the single-core and multi-core benchmarking tests. In spite of its impressive scores, however, 9To5Mac says those who are planning to buy the MacBook Pro sans Touch Bar should not expect for it to impeccably perform at high speeds for an extended amount of time because of its power-sipping 15W TDP. \nDisplay \nThe Cupertino giant is clearly stepping up its display game with its new laptops. Apple lists on its official site the differences between the display technology present on the two laptops. The 13-inch MacBook Air continues to sport the relatively dated LED-backlit Widescreen display with 1440 x 900 screen resolution. It has 300 nits brightness and standard color gamut. On the contrary, the MacBook Pro comes with Retina display that has 2560 x 1600 screen resolution, 500 nits brightness and wide color gamut. \nNotebook Check confirmed early November that the new MacBook Pro does have improved brightness. The computer review site even pointed out that the results of its tests showed that the new laptop has over 600 nits brightness at the center of the display panel, but the luminance slightly dropped toward the edges of the screen. Nevertheless, the distribution of brightness is considered remarkable at 89 percent. Notebook Check also claimed that the luminance of the new MacBook Pro’s display stands out among many other devices on the market, with the Dell XPS 13 9360 being the only one to beat the MacBook Pro in terms of contrast ratio. \nAccording to 9To5Mac , the 2016 MacBook Pro is the first laptop from the Cupertino giant to feature wide color display, which it first introduced on the 5K iMac. This advanced display technology is said to give off more vibrant greens and reds, so images appear more real. This is very evident when the new MacBook Pro and the MacBook Air are placed side by side. Without a high-resolution display, the MacBook Air readily falls behind the new MacBook Pro. \nDesign \nJust like what previous rumors claimed before Apple’s Oct. 27 launch event, the new MacBooks are redesigned iterations of the Cupertino giant’s famous laptop series. The MacBook Pro without Touch Bar is no exception, since it sports a thinner body and a smaller form. Its chassis even looks like a combination of the 12-inch Retina MacBook and the previous version of the MacBook Pro. It does not have the tapered front like the Air series, so it’s thicker at the front. But at their thickest points, it’s easy to see that the new MacBook Air is the thinner device. \nAlthough both laptops sport 13-inch screens, the MacBook Pro manages to afford a smaller form factor because of the thinner bezels surrounding its display. The commendable thing about the smaller frame of the device is it still managed to feature a full-size keyboard and loud speakers on either side. Speaking of keyboard, it is important to note that the new MacBook Pro comes with Apple’s improved butterfly switches, so the typing experience is improved and more satisfying than with the 12-inch MacBook that debuted with the original butterfly key switches. Each key in the new MacBook Pro also has its own LED, so backlight bleeds are very minimal. \nThe new MacBook Pro sports a larger Force Touch trackpad. Force Touch means the trackpad does not function through a mechanical button anymore. It simply has this force-sensitive technology to identify touch commands and it utilizes haptics and sound to produce clicks that may seem real to the user. Unfortunately, the MacBook Air still has a Multi-Touch trackpad, so clicking anywhere on the trackpad does not feel the same as when pressing the Force Touch trackpad. The main advantage of the latter — aside from saving component space underneath — is how clicks feel the same throughout the entire trackpad. This then allows users to register clicks on any part of the trackpad. \nSpecial Features \nThe new MacBook Pro comes with Thunderbolt 3 USB-C ports. These ports are fast, reliable and quite versatile. They can be used for data transfer, charging, video output and other functions for different peripherals. Because the Thunderbolt 3 port is highly versatile, Apple designed its new MacBook Pro to come with only this type of port. Thus, users would need to buy dongles if they need to connect their laptop to monitors, or use external storage and flash memory cards. For consumers who still prefer the traditional ports, the MacBook Air features two USB 3 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports, a MagSafe 2 power port and an SDXC card slot. \nTo state the obvious, the MacBook Air has a glowing Apple logo — the one that was considered the trademark of previous-generation MacBook devices. Given that the new MacBook Pro is excessively thin, it wasn’t possible for Apple to include the glowing Apple logo on its back. Instead, the new MacBooks sport a color-matched inset logo. Since it lacks the trademark glowing logo, however, Apple decided to give the new MacBook Pro a new color variant. So instead of just seeing Silver MacBook Pros in Apple stores, there will be Space Gray units for those who want a premium Apple laptop with a different color. \nMiscellaneous",

      "text": "Technology Apple, FANG Tech Leaders Still Have Trump Headache Apple CEO Tim Cook, here speaking at a company event, was a major supporter of Hillary Clinton. (AP) Reprints \nFacebook ( FB ) stock pierced its 200-day moving average early Monday, as did Alphabet ( GOOGL ), as the largest tech stocks — FANG plus Apple ( AAPL ) — continued to fall in the wake of Donald Trump's surprise presidential win. \nTrump has championed Rust Belt issues and has specifically criticized Apple and Amazon.com ( AMZN ). He's also feuded with the Washington Post, which is owned by Amazon found and CEO Jeff Bezos. \nSectors such as banks, drugs and defense have gotten a boost from the Trump win, and those stocks could be getting some funds that had gone to the biggest tech stocks, in a sector rotation. Facebook \nFacebook stock was down 4% in early trading in the stock market today , near 114, at a more than four-month low. Shares on Thursday pierced the 200-day average, a key support line, for the first time since Jan. 20, as Facebook had been a leading stock this year. On Friday, Facebook stock closed right at its 200-day line. The stock is down 17% since touching an all-time high of 133.50 on Oct. 25. Ironically, some pundits says fake news sites on Facebook contributed to Trump's win, but Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg has sharply objected. \n\"Personally I think the idea that fake news on Facebook, of which it's a very small amount of the content, influenced the election in any way is a pretty crazy idea,\" Zuckerberg reportedly said at the Techonomy conference on Thursday near Silicon Valley. Apple \nTrump has criticized Apple for manufacturing its smartphones and other products overseas. Apple CEO Tim Cook also had been a big supporter of his opponent, Hillary Clinton. Apple stock was down 3.5% early Monday, at a two-month low near 104.50, and has been trading below the key 50-day support line all month. Shares are approaching the 200-day line, which the stock hasn't breached since July. \nThe president-elect, however, has proposed a one-time big tax cut for U.S. companies looking to bring cash back from overseas. That could be a big plus for Apple, which leads in cash holdings at a gaudy $230 billion-plus, but the great majority of those funds are overseas. The company faces a huge tax bite if it tries to move that cash back to the U.S. Alphabet \nGoogle-parent Alphabet saw its stock pierce its 200-day line for the first time since mid-July. The Google Home smart-home speaker, which started shipping this month, is seen as a solid challenge to Amazon's hit Echo smart speaker, but Alphabet recently pulled back on its Project Wing drone initiative. \nAlphabet stock was down 1% early Monday, near 764, a four-month low. Shares are down more than 6% since the election. Netflix \nStreaming-video leader Netflix ( NFLX ) was down more than 2%, near 112, in early trading Monday. That's a one-month low, but the stock remains above its 50- and 200-day lines. It also is forming a cup-with-handle base , with a possibly buy point at 129.40, but the stock has fallen 10 days out of the past 11 trading days, including Monday. Amazon.com \nAmazon stock was down 2%, near 725, in early trading Monday. Trump has talked about what he says might be unfair tax advantages that the No. 1 online seller might have enjoyed, though he's made no specific proposals. Amazon stock is down 8% since Wednesday, following Trump's victory. Amazon shares fell below their 50-day line on Oct. 28, for the first time since late June, and are getting fairly close to the 200-day line. \nRELATED:",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray J.P. Morgan ’s Rod Hall today shuffles the deck of his networking equipment names, with Ciena ( CIEN ) still his top pick, but Cisco Systems ( CSCO ) and Apple ( AAPL ) both dropping some points in his ranking.\nHall puts last week’s upset victory by Donald Trump in the U.S. presidential election front and center, noting “the sector underperformed last month with a 0.6% gain vs. the S&P500 up 1.3%.”\n“We note that post election moves have not been helpful,” writes Hall, “with large tech names generally selling off as overall growth optimism increases.”\nCisco, whose shares Hall rates Neutral, plummet in his rankings from 8th place back in October to 16th place, following “multiple negative enterprise data points in Q3 reporting.\nHe sums up that “as enterprise spending has weakened in late 2016 we see Cisco at some short term risk,” and “we also believe that increasing expectations for inflation and economic growth would likely be bad news for Cisco.”\nAlthough he rates Apple shares Overweight, it does to 15th place from October’s 10th place ranking, as “Apple has shown itself to be exposed to weakening macro conditions which the company downplayed late in 2015.”\n“The December numbers benefit from an extra week of sales Q/Q and Y/Y but we see potential for deteriorating high end smartphone demand in early 2017.”\nFor Ciena, which he also rates Overweight, it holds onto its 1st-place status, “due to an expected multi- year ramp in 100G optical spending which should continue to accelerate in 2017.” The shares are “materially undervalued,” he believes.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- U.S. stocks are slightly lower Monday as technology companies like Apple and Microsoft take big losses on fears about their overseas revenue. That&apos;s canceling out huge gains for banks, which are trading higher as bond yields rise to their highest levels since January.\nKEEPING SCORE: The Dow Jones industrial average gained 12 points, or 0.1 percent, to 18,859 as of noon Eastern time. The Standard & Poor&apos;s 500 index lost 2 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,162. The Nasdaq composite sank 21 points, or 0.4 percent, to 5,215.\nTECH TROUBLES: Technology companies fell sharply, with familiar names taking some of the largest losses. Apple gave up $3.31, or 3.1 percent, to $105.12 while Facebook declined $4.36, or 3.7 percent, to $114.66 and Microsoft slid $1.23, or 2.1 percent, to $57.80. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, slipped $22.47, or 2.9 percent, to $749.28. Tech stocks have struggled over the last few days as investors wonder if Donald Trump&apos;s policies as president will hurt their sales in China and other markets overseas.\nBANK BONANZA: Bank stocks continued to surge, as they&apos;ve done since the election. Higher bond yields point to higher interest rates and bigger profits for banks from lending money. Investors have been selling bonds, pushing yields higher, as they expect the spending plans of president-elect Trump to lead to higher inflation.\nInvestors are also pleased at the prospect of looser regulation and bigger profits. Trump&apos;s election could result in big changes to the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill or to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Bank of America rose 97 cents, or 5.1 percent, to $19.99 and JPMorgan Chase picked up $2.55, or 3.3 percent, to $79.24.\nDOING DEALS: South Korean conglomerate Samsung said it will buy Harman International for $8 billion, or $112 a share. Harman makes products for connected cars including audio systems and safety and entertainment features. Its stock jumped $22.35, or 25.5 percent, to $110.\nMENTORING: German industrial equipment company Siemens agreed to buy software maker Mentor Graphics for $4.5 billion, or $37.25 a share. Mentor&apos;s stock rose $5.67, or 18.5 percent, to $36.35.\nDIG IT: Shares of communication adapter maker Digi International rose $1.67, or 14.4 percent, to $13.33 after the company said it received an offer from Belden, a communications equipment company. Digi said it rejected the bid of $13.82 a share, or about $359 million, because it&apos;s too low. Belden stock added $1.69, or 2.4 percent, to $71.39.\nBONDS: Bond prices fell. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note rose to 2.22 percent. Bond trading was closed Friday for the U.S. Veterans&apos; Day holiday. The 10-year yield, which is a benchmark for interest rates on home mortgages and other kinds of loans, finished at 2.06 percent on Thursday. The day before the Nov. 8 presidential election the yield was 1.83 percent.\nCURRENCIES: The dollar rose sharply against other currencies as U.S. interest rates rose. It jumped to 108.36 Japanese yen from 106.78 yen. The euro fell to $1.0719 from $1.0845.\nENERGY: With the dollar gaining strength, benchmark U.S. crude fell $1.12, or 2.6 percent, to $42.29 a barrel in New York. Brent crude, used to price international oils, lost $1.11, or 2.5 percent, to $43.64 a barrel in London.\nThat pulled energy companies lower. Anadarko Petroleum fell $1.87, or 3.1 percent, to $59.17 and Exxon Mobil lost $1.24, or 1.4 percent, to $84.43.\nDIVIDEND PAYERS DIVE: Investors are also selling companies that pay big dividends like utilities and phone companies as bonds become more appealing to investors seeking income. Phone and utility companies and real estate investment trusts all traded lower. Those stocks are most appealing to investors when bond yields are low. American Tower fell $4.72, or 4.5 percent, to $100.99 and Duke Energy lost 80 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $74.44.\nTRUMP FACTOR: Stocks went into a long skid as the presidential campaign came to its conclusion, but in the last few days stocks have risen as investors hope a Trump presidency will mean cutbacks in regulations that affect energy and banks, among other businesses. The Dow has reached record highs, with the biggest recent gains going to financial firms Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan, machinery maker Caterpillar and drug company Merck.\nOVERSEAS: France&apos;s CAC 40 was up 0.4 percent and Germany&apos;s DAX rose 0.3 percent. The FTSE 100 index of leading British shares was 0.4 percent higher. In Japan the Nikkei 225 jumped 1.7 percent after a strong reading on Japan&apos;s economic growth. The dollar has been particularly strong against the Japanese yen lately and that&apos;s helped the country&apos;s exporters. Most other Asian markets fell. The Kospi in South Korea lost 0.5 percent and Hong Kong&apos;s Hang Seng slipped 1.4 percent.\n----\nAP Markets Writer Marley Jay can be reached at http://twitter.com/MarleyJayAP His work can be found at http://bigstory.ap.org/journalist/marley-jay\n ",
