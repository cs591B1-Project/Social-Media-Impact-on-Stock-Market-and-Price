      "text": "The Offer Direct link to offer \nBuy a CD or Vinyl and get $20 for Amazon Music Unlimited \nThe Fine Print This is a limited time offer. Beginning at 12:01am (PT) November 25, 2016 and ending at 11:59pm (PT) November 28, 2016, when you purchase any CD or Vinyl sold by Amazon.com, a $20 credit will be auto-applied to your account. The promotional credit only applies to a subscription of Amazon Music Unlimited. Upon completion of your shipment, you will receive an e-mail from Amazon that indicates the benefit that you received. The e-mail will also provide instructions on how to activate the promotional credit. If you are a new subscriber to Amazon Music Unlimited, you will also be eligible for a 1 month free trial in addition to this offer. Qualifying customers have thirty (30) days to activate their free trial before the benefit expires. The benefit applies to all qualifying customers, regardless of previous free trial usage or current level of subscription. Digital content and services may only be available to customers located in the U.S. and are subject to the terms and conditions of Amazon Digital Services LLC. Offer limited to one per customer and account. Offer good while supplies last. Amazon reserves the right to modify or cancel the offer at any time. Offer is non-transferable and may not be resold. If any of the products or content related to this offer are returned, your refund will equal the amount you paid for the product or content, subject to applicable refund policies. If you violate any of these terms, the offer will be invalid. Our Verdict Amazon Music Unlimited costs $9.99 a month ($7.99 for prime members) so this is basically good for two free months (and you can one month free if you’re a new user). I personally prefer Spotify (but have heard good things about Google’s service, haven’t heard much about Amazon’s). I’m sure there are some incredibly cheap CD’s that you can purchase, share the cheapest ones you find in the comments. This is a great deal for those that use music unlimited as at worst you should be able to make an easy $12 savings (lots of $8 CD’s).\nOther Cyber Monday deals are now live as well. We will keep you updated if we see anything interesting, as always make sure your following us on Twitter so you don’t miss any of the action.\nThis post contains our affiliate links to Amazon.com, we appreciate you using them to support the site. \nThe post Amazon: Buy a CD Or Vinyl & Get $20 Amazon Music Unlimited Credit appeared first on Doctor Of Credit .\n",

      "text": "Amazon’s Middle East Expansion Reportedly Costs $1 Billion By Adnan Farooqui on 11/27/2016 08:27 PST \nHaving cemented its position as the largest online retailer on the planet, Amazon is now believed to be looking into a possible expansion into the Middle East. Rumor has it that the company is going to acquire Souq.com, often referred to as the Amazon of the Middle East, and that it’s willing to spend up to $1 billion on this purchase. Souq.com is an established online retailer with a presence in some of the most lucrative markets in the Middle East. \nBy acquiring Souq.com, Amazon will gain access to markets the United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia. Whether or not an acquisition will take place remains to be seen because there’s no confirmation or denial as yet from Amazon or Souq.com. \nIt’s not just Souq.com’s presence in the Middle East that’s going to help Amazon. The company has also developed a new payment system as payment by credit cards is not as common in that part of the world as it is elsewhere. Customers can purchase products by topping up a prepaid card at retail locations by paying cash. \nBloomberg says that the online retailer was actually going to sell at least a 30 percent stake in the company but it may end up selling itself completely to Amazon if the price is right. Souq.com is said to have appointed Goldman Sachs to find a buyer for the company which sells more than 1.5 million products online to customers in the Middle East. \nFiled in Web .

      "title": "Google Home Review: Compared to Amazon Echo?",
      "text": "The new Google Home pits Google against Amazon’s popular Amazon Echo and Alexa. Home listens for a keyword, just like Amazon Echo, and then answers questions or plays content. How does Google’s connected information speaker compete with Amazon’s? And what kinds of things can a user do with Google Home?\nAdvertisement\nLike Echo, the Google Home connects to the Internet and plays music, answers questions, tells users when their next appointment starts or how long it will take to get to work. It’s kind of like having the Star Trek computer in your home, but without as much power or information, at least that’s what we all would hope. Of course Home falls far short of that, but we’re getting closer. The Google Assistant that powers Google Home can do more than the old Google Now available on Android phones by saying “Ok Google…”.\nGoogle Home Design The Google Home appliance sits on a shelf or other surface and connects to the Internet through your home or office Wi-Fi. It’s not very big, measuring 3.79-inches in diameter and 5.62-inches tall. The round device comes with a slanted wedged top. It’s white on the top two-thirds and the bottom comes with a mesh patterned base.\nAdvertisement\nOn top, we get a pair of mics and some LEDs. The surface responds to touch, which raises the volume or lowers it.\nAdvertisement\nThe AC cable plugs into the bottom of the Google Home. It has a rubber cord which is long enough to put the device on a higher shelf.\nOn back, there’s a physical button to mute the built-in mics that sit on the top. A green LED indicates power state and flashes when the Home’s ready to set up.\nAdvertisement\nThe base comes with a gray color. Google offers replacement bases in multiple colors and materials for $20 each .\nOn top of the Google Home, we see some LEDs that show when the user interacts with their device. They come off easily. Unplug the AC cable and grab the bottom to pull it off. The base magnetically snaps back into place when you put the new base on the Google Home.\nThe LEDs on top of the device function in a few differnent ways. The Google Help site shows a chart listing all the ways these LEDs communicate to the user. One important indicator is volume. The circle of lights show the volume level. Swiping in a circular motion turns it up or down.\nAdvertisement\nInternally, there’s a set of “Far-field” mics that can recognize your voice from across the room. It does a good job of hearing the user and interpreting their words accurately.\nThe speakers in the Google Home sound decent. In fact they’re better than the Amazon Echo. No one will mistake these for high-end speakers, but they work fine for some ambient music or listening to podcasts. The speakers adequately share the results of your commands and searches.\nGoogle Home Functionality Set up the Google Home using the new Home app (formerly Google Cast) for Android or iOS .\nAdvertisement\nTo interact with Google Home say OK GOOGLE or HEY GOOGLE . For those with an Android phone that has always listening waiting for you to say “OK Google” use the “Hey Google” so that you can differentiate which device you’re talking to. Otherwise both will try to answer your query or command.\nGoogle Home can do many kinds of things. For example, connect it to your favorite music streaming service and then tell it to play music . It works with subscription services like Google Play Music, Pandora, YouTube Red and Spotify. Tell Google Home to play some music to randomly let it play anything based on your earlier music choices. You can also specify a playlist or album or play a genre or artist. If you like a music in a service like YouTube Red, then you can like or dislike it by saying “Ok Google, Thumbs Up!” Set the default music streaming service inside the Google Home app.\nIf you want to listen to a podcast, tell Google Home to play it by saying, “Ok Google/Hey Google, Play This American Life”. If you missed an episode, tell it to “Play previous episode” after telling it to play the podcast.\nGet the news by telling Google Home to “Catch me up” or “Listen to the news”. Set up what news it plays from the Home app.\nAny Android app that supports casting content can play audio from that app. I prefer the Pocket Cast app for podcasts. This also works from the Chrome browser and Chromebooks.\nUsers can also work with their Google Calendar or with Google maps for important information like commute times or accident warnings on the way. A user will have to use a regular Google account and NOT a G-Suite or Google Apps account to hear about appointments, add appointments or add items to a To Do list.\nThe fact that Google Home doesn’t work with my Google Apps account is the most frustrating and annoying aspect of the Google universe. They always limit G-Suite/Google Apps accounts by not adding the newest features to these accounts.\nUsers with home automation devices like Hue lights, a Nest thermostat or Logitech Harmony TV remote can also control these using Google Home. Any device that’s compatible with Smart Things will work. Learn more about home automation from Google’s site . It’s handy to tell the Google Home to turn on the TV or dim the lights. Also, Google Home works with IFTTT so you can create a lot of controls not already built in. Search for Google Assistant on the IFTTT site .\nThere’s a large collection of other cool functions Google Home can do. Play a trivia game by saying, “I’m feeling lucky.” Search for information about movies, sports, restaurants, movies or a slew of other fun or even boring facts. Get dictionary definitions or calculate complex math problems. Google Home even has some fun hidden skills that it will tell you if you just ask . Put one in the kitchen and use it as an egg timer or create a shopping list.\nGoogle Home vs. Amazon Echo Comparing Google Home and Amazon Echo makes sense since they’re so similar in function and form. Google Home looks a lot better than Amazon Echo in all its forms. The Echo Tap, Dot or the original Echo all look more industrial. Google Home looks like the designers planned for users to put it out in the open. Add the colorful bases and Google Home fits your room’s decor better than the boring black or white Echo.\nIf you don’t like the Google Home’s design, then you’re out of luck. At least with Amazon Echo, you get a few options. The original Amazon Echo stands taller than the Google Home and takes up about the same space on a shelf or desk. The smaller Tap fits in a bag and goes on the road thanks to the battery. The Dot hides better and plugs into a set of speakers for better sound. That makes the Echo more versatile than the Google Home.\nThe design and look don’t matter if they don’t work. Amazon’s ecosystem of Skills are way ahead of the Google Home because it came to market earlier. If you can think of it, someone’s probably created a Skill that can do it with Echo.\nGoogle Home comes with more limits. It doesn’t enjoy as many features as Echo has Skills. Also, it doesn’t work with Google Apps accounts (G Suite). If your Google account comes with an email address of anything other than [email protected] , then you can’t manage your calendar, contacts or To-Do lists. That’s incredibly annoying. It means that Amazon Echo works with such Google accounts better than Google’s own device. This practice has to end! I’ve yet to hear a good reason to limit such users.\nBoth devices will recognize your voice incredibly well. Both devices will also accidentally respond when you don’t want them to. Amazon Echo seems more sensitive and responds to words in TV shows or audio recordings that I’m listening to more than Google Home does.\nOne of the biggest problems comes from the vast array of functions both devices can do. It’s hard to remember all that Echo or Home can do. You have to train yourself to remember the commands and to use them. I often find myself picking up my phone to do things I could easily do with Google Home or Amazon Echo.\nThe Google Home costs less than the Amazon Echo, but more than Amazon Dot. The Tap and Home cost the same. Here’s the list of prices.\nGoogle Home – $129 Echo – $179 Tap – $129 Dot – $50 or 6 for $250 (about $42 each when bought together) Recommendation Should you get a Google Home? If you’re a Google user and your account’s not tied to a school, work or personal domain account, then it’s a good option. It’s already excellent early on and will likely grow more useful as new features get added.\nIf you use a Google Apps account (also called G Suite), then don’t bother yet. Wait till Google opens it up to these kinds of accounts. If you really want a voice activated speaker, but want to use it with your G Suite or Google Apps account, then get the Echo, Dot or Tap. If you want to get the flavor of each server, try the Alexa Skill Testing Tool from Echoism . The only way to try the latest version of Google Assistant, which powers Home, is to try it on a Google Pixel or Pixel XL phone. You can see the older version using the OK Google command on other Android phones or tablets or from a Google Chrome browser. It’s not the same, but close.\nIn spite of the weaknesses of Google Home, I prefer it over Amazon Echo. Echo has more skills and plays my Audible audio books. However, Home looks more like a decoration and seems to find more obscure facts thanks to its connection with Google’s search engine. I also believe that it will improve and hopefully the limitation for Google G Suite users will get lifted.",

      "text": "Posted: Nov 27 2016, 11:22am CST | by Ahmed Humayun , in Rumors | Apple \nShop Now: Amazon's Best Cyber Monday Deals The Dual Lens System may not be limited to the Plus variant in iPhone 8 \nA report has emerged from South Korea which states that Apple is working with LG to develop a highly capable module which will offer 3D photographing in iPhone 8. Apple already has a great relationship with LG currently. The company is providing Apple with iSight Duo-lens system which comes with the iPhone 7 Plus. Don't Miss: The Best Cyber Monday Deals on Sale Now \nThis relationship is to be taken further to develop an innovative camera to be included in the iPhone 8. Apple has always worked hard to take the photographic experience one step ahead with its latest iPhone. This policy was also seen in the iPhone 7 duo where the Plus model was differentiated with the dual-lens camera system. \nThe portrait mode is also a great experience in the iPhone 7 Plus. If today’s report is true then Apple could be looking at LG to bring more complexity and innovation in the next iPhone 8. Apple does however hold many patents related to object and gesture recognition in 3D space. You never know the company just might be thinking to include such technology. \nThe current iPhone 7 has a great camera experience. It is most likely that Apple will work hard with LG to develop a smaller camera module which has the same power as the current dual lens system so that it can be included in the iPhone range next year. \nCyber Monday 2016: Shop the best Cyber Monday Deals at:",

      "title": "Brazil to pursue satellite, nuclear sub projects despite downturn: Minister",
      "text": "BRASILIA: Ambitious projects such as satellites that could bring the internet to the remote Amazon and construction of Brazil's first nuclear submarine will proceed despite a deep economic downturn, the defence minister told AFP.\nRaul Jungmann said he will be in France this Thursday to take delivery of the first of three communications and defense satellites built by France's Thales and due for launching on Mar 21 next year.\nThe nearly six tonne, 2.1 billion reais (US$617 million) satellite is at the core of a modernisation of Brazil's military that Jungmann said will still take hits during planned government austerity cuts.\n\"We know there's going to be a new fiscal policy with a spending ceiling. We know we'll have to cut back,\" he said in an interview in Brasilia.\nHowever, some projects \"are already at an advanced stage and cannot be stopped, like the nuclear submarine or the four conventional submarines that are also being developed in France,\" he said. \"Three of them are already being built.\"\nSwedish Gripen war planes whose payment schedule he said \"is sufficiently flexible\" will also survive the cuts.\nBut with President Michel Temer pushing an austerity strategy through Congress, starting with a proposed 20-year freeze on budget increases, \"there are other things we need to review,\" he said.\nThe satellite program remains a top priority, described by the minister as a chance for Brazil \"to achieve a technological standard that we don't have today.\"\nStationed over Ecuador, the network will cover all of South America, the southern Atlantic and the west coast of Africa, \"what we call Brazil's strategic sphere,\" Jungmann said.\nThe network will expand broadband coverage throughout Brazil, \"which is an enormous advance for society. It will allow it to reach remote places, the Amazon for example,\" the minister added.\nThe telecoms satellites will also bring new security for Brazil by putting all government communications under the country's control and strengthening military communications, he said.\nBIG ARMY, NO ENEMY \n\nBrazil maintains one of the largest militaries in the Americas, partly to patrol its huge borders, which include 4,660 miles (7,500 kilometres) of coastline.\nJungmann said the military is concerned by the proximity of \"major drug producers and that Brazil, especially in urban centres, has unfortunately turned into a drug consumer. An integrated market has developed both for drugs and weapons.\"\nAlthough Brazil is not involved in any active conflicts abroad, it has used its military to project influence, including with a major peacekeeping mission to Haiti.\nThe military has also been called on to support outgunned police in battles with drug gangs in Rio de Janeiro. Members of the armed forces were also deployed around the country earlier this year to assist in a campaign against mosquitoes carrying the Zika virus.\nThe military ruled Brazil during a dictatorship from 1964 to 1985. However, its powers have since been curbed and now - at a time the country is being shaken by its worst recession in decades and a cascade of corruption scandals - is widely seen as the country's most trusted institution.\n- AFP/ec\nEmail More",

      "text": "Featured News Tech \nAfter fully entering the music streaming market, Amazon has made yet another powermove: event tickets. Amazon Tickets is the newest branch of the online empire, and though the service saw a successful soft launch in UK last year, an expansions to Europe, Asia, and the U.S. are currently in the works. \nEstablished ticket outlets in America have seen relatively little competition, so it’ll be curious to see the response from names like Ticketmaster, StubHub, and Eventbrite. Here’s the vision for Amazon Tickets, according to a job posting for the budding service. \n“Our vision goes beyond just selling tickets as we aim to disrupt the entire live entertainment experience, including what happens before, during and after the show. The ticketing business is ripe for innovation and improvement, as much of the industry has not fundamentally changed since the 1970s.” \nCheck out what the UK’s version of Amazon Tickets looks like here .",

What I see, however, is the place people go to shop online.\nWhile that might sound completely obvious, it's an advantage that's hard for competitors to overcome. Fifty-five percent of American online shoppers begin their product search on Amazon.com, according to a recent survey from BloomReach . I'm willing to bet a large percentage of shoppers end their product search on Amazon as well.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nIn the middle of its busy season — Cyber Monday is just hours away — Amazon has been busy on internal fronts as well. After dumping incentivized reviews , the retail giant is going to start capping the number of product reviews any customer can submit in a given week. According to The Digital Reader , an email went out to Amazon’s more enthusiastic reviewers telling them of this change.\nBasically, you can review any product at any time if you bought it from Amazon. However, if it’s a non-Amazon Verified Purchase, there’s a limit. In GeekWire , an Amazon rep confirmed the changes.\nMore: Mobile shopping continues to make an impact on Thanksgiving and Black Friday\n“Customers can now only submit a limited number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews a week. The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00 a.m. UTC through Saturday 11:59 p.m. UTC. Customers’ ability to submit Amazon Verified Purchase reviews will not be impacted. This policy also does not apply to Vine reviews or reviews on digital and physical books, music, and video.”\nYou can read the Community Guidelines here . The Digital Reader notes that the Amazon review structure has been under fire as the company reportedly squashed negative reviews and ratings for Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new book , “politically motivated commentary submitted by people who hadn’t been verified to have purchased the book.” This new system would not have had an effect on those reviews, given that it doesn’t apply to books.\nThese are critical moves for Amazon to make. Given its stature in the online marketplace and the global economy in general, it’s essential for Amazon to have a solid bond of trust with its user base, and it goes the other way, too. End users need to be able to trust the Amazon is giving them the straight scoop, and Amazon needs to be sure that it’s getting the straight scoop from reviewers. Anything less does a disservice to everyone involved.\nAmazon has dumped ‘incentivized’ reviews, but product ratings aren’t changing much Amazon has finally banned those pesky ‘incentivized’ reviews",

      "text": "Los AngelesCalifornia If you have an Amazon Prime account and have yet to use Amazon Prime Now, use code 15OFFNOW to get $15 off your first Prime Now order. YMMV because Prime Now is not offered everywhere, and the selection varies by area.This should lead you to the board/card games section of Prime Now: https://primenow.amazon.com/browse?srs=166220011&ref_=pn_br_... In my area, for example, Splendor sells for $29.49, but with the $15 off, I can get it for $14.49. I plan to use the code on Monday in case Cyber Monday deals affect prices.Note: Amazon automatically sets a $5 tip for the courier, but you can remove the tip, add a tip later, or tip in person.The promo code 15OFFNOW expires on Monday, November 28 at 11:59 PST.Source: 3DSdeals subreddit",

      "text": "Photo via Amazon (CC-BY-SA) Stock up on best-selling charge gear for cheap today. \nSearching desperately for an outlet to charge your phone while you're traveling puts a real kink in your adventures. Not the good kind, either. \nFortunately, Anker's running a one-day Amazon sale on three highly popular models. They're all less than $30 right now, so you might want to take a look. \nIf you like to travel light, the Astro E1 is the size of a candy bar and can provide one to two full charges depending on your phone's model. It's normally $50, but you can get one for just $12 today. \nHeavier users that can stand a bit more weight in their backpack should go for the Powercore 20100 , which weighs 12.5 ounces and can charge an iPhone 6 completely six times over. Today, it's 65 percent off . \nIf you're still about that wall socket life, there's an option for you there too. The Quick Charge wall charger gives you two USB slots so you can charge multiple devices faster, which sure beats being chained to the outlet for an hour. You can pick one up for $20 today and save a whopping 71 percent.",

      "text": "( Carrollz ) I have the family Alhambra which just comes with a couple expansions -maybe only 1?- I don't know because I never use it and wouldn't even consider an expansion for that game, it's one of my all time favorites as is. I think I once looked into the expansions and thought one or two might add some more strategy but for the most part felt that they would take away some of the tension that I enjoy in it and I completely agree that if I want something more it's easier just to get out another game -if my collection was more limited the expansions might've made more sense for me. I got Paris Connection earlier for $4 more and it was totally worth it to me.... I'm not even bothered that I could've got it for less so soon after I purchased it because I've had so much fun with it already. With only being able to do one out of two possible actions on your turn this game is just so simple, even simpler than Alhambra with more direct interaction, and yet there is so much to think about and juggle with that simple choice -I love it! And it plays quickly even with six... the set up is my one complaint since you have to blind draw from a bag and then dump out the trains and arrange them by color onto their own boards and there are a lot of those little trains! But I guess I just really enjoy these simple games with nice components that play quickly... I also really enjoy Parfum and Push a Monster that are both available for even lower cost than the incredible deals I thought I got on those.",

      "text": "Surfing Amazon's Giant Waves Is a Thing of Past Man-made influences are being blamed By Elizabeth Armstrong Moore , Newser Staff Posted Nov 27, 2016 12:53 PM CST 0 comments Comments Surfers walk on a beach in Fortaleza, Brazil, Wednesday, July 2, 2014. Fortaleza is one of many cities hosting World Cup soccer matches this month. (AP Photo/Rodrigo Abd) (Newser) – As the sun crosses the Equator during the fall and spring equinoxes in September and March, strong gravitational and lunar pulls trigger tidal bores around the world as the flow of nearby rivers reverses and the water grows turbulent. Along Brazil’s remote Araguari River in the Amazon, this created the perfect conditions for surfers for years as Atlantic waters flowed in; the \"thundering waves\" of the Pororoca—the local name for a tidal bore that translates to \"mighty noise\" in the indigenous Tupi language—were \"legendary,\" as the New York Times reports. But now the surfers who flew, canoed, trekked, and drove many miles to ride the Amazon's tidal bore in Brazil say the thrilling five-foot waves are gone, thanks in large part to man-made influences like huge ranches full of invasive Asian water buffaloes and hydroelectric dams built along the Araguari River. Some local surfers are now on the hunt for other stretches of river to surf along the Amazon, while one tells the Times that Papua New Guinea and India protect their great tidal bores. In the Amazon, however, \"it's a warning of how man's actions can change our rivers forever,\" says a professional surfer. Today, surfers can only tell stories about riding the mighty Pororoca on the Araguari River; the last time it was surfable was in 2013. (Meanwhile, women just made history at a surfing competition in Maui.)",
