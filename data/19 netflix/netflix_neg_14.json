      "text": "'Saturday Night Live' recap: Dave Chappelle \nDave Chappelle is teaming up with Netflix for three new stand-up specials. \nThe streaming provider announced Monday that Chappelle and director Stan Lathan will produce an original stand-up comedy special for Netflix. The comedian will also release two never-before-seen shows from his “personal vault,” which were filmed at Austin City Limits and The Hollywood Palladium. All three of the projects, which represent Chappelle’s first concert specials in 12 years, will be released simultaneously in 2017. \nChappelle recently hosted the first post-election episode of Saturday Night Live , which delivered season high ratings . He created and starred in the landmark sketch series The Chappelle Show , which ran for three seasons on Comedy Central. Over the past three years, he has performed over 500 concerts and in 2014, he did 10 consecutive sold-out performances at Radio City Music Hall. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice-president of original documentary and comedy, in a statement. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.” ",

      "text": "\n(Netflix) Posted November 21 2016 — 10:30 AM EST \nIn his new Netflix special, Michael Che Matters , Saturday Night Live cast member Michael Che jokes he could be friends with Donald Trump. But Che performed that bit on Aug. 5 — before the Republican candidate was elected president, and prior to the release of the 2005 Access Hollywood tape where Trump says, among other graphic remarks, he can grab women “by the p—y.” \n“I didn’t know he grabs vaginas at random,” Che tells EW now, laughing. “I mean, that’s a strange friend to have.” \nBut when Che did tell the joke initially, he explains he was showing the difference between someone a person trusts and someone a person can chill with. “Just because you dislike a candidate and just because you think a guy would do a terrible job doesn’t necessarily mean you have to hate him and you have to treat him like garbage and he loses all his humanity because he doesn’t agree with your politics,” he says, before adding, “But also, this was way, way before we found out that he had pending sexual assault cases and all that stuff. That changes things a bit.” (Trump has repeatedly denied any sexual misconduct, and threatened to sue his multiple accusers following the election.) \nChe also talked to EW about how Weekend Update is going to cover Trump now that he’s about to officially be in office, his feelings on the word “offensive,” and what effect internet outrage has — or doesn’t have — on him. Watch Michael Che Matters when the special debuts Nov. 25 on Netflix. \nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: How’d you end up with the title Michael Che Matters ? MICHAEL CHE: It just felt timely, and it also felt like it made sense. What it means to me, is just that: What I’m saying isn’t crazy , and even if it is crazy , I feel like I matter enough to myself to be honest – even if you don’t like it. People aren’t being honest with their feelings. They’re holding things in; they’re not saying it plainly. I’m saying, “Listen, my feelings matter. And I’m going to say it this way, even if it’s politically incorrect, quote-unquote, or if it’s not woke, quote-unquote, or if it’s offensive, quote-unquote, whatever it is.” \nSo you’re kind of saying, let’s look at all sides of everything. I’m always looking at all sides, because my objective is to figure it out. The objective is unity. The objective is people coming together and coming to an understanding, so you always have to hear all the sides. I’m not into the mean comedy that’s just, “Everybody is stupid.” It’s more like, “Listen, we all got our problems, and let’s figure out how we can stop being so obnoxious to each other.” \nIs there anything that offends you ? Yes. But, also, I’m okay with it. I think “offensive” is a weird word, where people think if it’s offensive, it needs to cease to exist. And I don’t believe that. If something offends me, I’m just offended, and that’s about it. I can deal with that. It’s okay. I’m not going to explode, I’m not going to die. [ Laughs ] I have the right to be offended, and you have the right to be offensive. \nYou caught some flak for your comments on that catcalling video , which you address in the special. What was going through your mind when all that happened? First of all, I had just gotten the job at SNL , so I had never seen that much attention for something. It felt like everybody was talking about it. Even though everybody wasn’t talking about it. But in my world, it felt like everybody was. It was a little bit weird to just to be on that side of that. You’ve seen people get in quote-unquote trouble for stuff, but I had never been really a part of it. But also, I really always felt like what I was saying was honest and right. I never feel bad for being honest. You could disagree, you could say it’s terrible, you could say whatever you want, but if I’m being honest, then it’s fine. Just like I would never be offended by women who have honest experiences — how could I be offended by something that’s really part of your life? I’m just telling you a different side of it. At that point, I always felt secure in the fact that I was telling the truth. I wasn’t just saying something to be mean, and I wasn’t just saying something to be contrarian, because it came from an honest place. It also came from an understanding place. I never really got too down on myself because I knew where I was coming from. \nDid you change your position at all on the catcalling video once you started seeing women criticizing you? My position was always that catcalling sucks! [ Laughs ] I never changed my position because I always understood that. It’s very awkward and terrible and makes everybody involved uncomfortable — or it should . That’s what I talk about in the special. Nah, I never changed my position. I truly believe it sucks. \nDo you hold back at all now that you’ve seen what the internet will do to you for stuff like that? No, because they don’t do anything to you. They just talk. The internet is World of Warcraft: Everybody is who they imagine themselves to be, and it’s not real. I go outside, I buy a coffee from the deli guy; he has no idea. [ Laughs ] Cars don’t stop for me and say, “Hey, aren’t you the guy who did that thing?” Internet outrage that would affect my life is if Amazon stopped selling me products because of what I said about catcalling. [ Laughs ] I don’t care about what somebody in their basement or whatever says. Believe it or not, there are audiences of people across the country who buy tickets to my shows and we laugh and we have a great time. As long as I can keep doing that, I really don’t care what anybody on the internet says. \nIn the special, you say it’s a crazy time to do comedy because so much is going on right now. Is that a positive? It’s always a positive thing. I think comedy is always changing and sensibilities are changing and sometimes peoples’ ears are changing. I think a lot of times, we would tell jokes about Hillary Clinton and people would be upset — not talking about the jokes weren’t funny, but they didn’t like that we were making jokes about Hillary Clinton in a time where Donald Trump existed. What’s expected is different. But as a performer, for material, yes, it’s a golden age. It feels like the world is on fire. Somebody’s gotta tell the truth. It’s not going to be the news. \nOn that note, how does Weekend Update plan to tackle Trump now that he’s president? I think we make a conscious effort to judge it and cover it honestly. If he’s done something good, make fun of it; if he’s done something bad, we’ll make fun of it. Our job is to make fun of people. That’s what we do. We’re nobody’s friend. If Hillary Clinton won, we’d rip her apart too, just because that’s what we do. That’s our job. Trump is a little more fun to cover. It’s a little bit easier to get people on our side, and he does a lot more crazy things that make you say, “What in the hell?” [ Laughs ] \nBut it doesn’t matter who it is; we have to cover it honestly and fair and do the part that not everybody’s going to do. It’s so easy to just to get on a Trump-bashing [spree] all season or his entire presidency. But is that interesting comedy? Do you really just want to hear 90 minutes of “Trump is orange” jokes? And “Trump’s got a little d—” jokes? Like, who cares? Let’s see past that. I think we’ve done that for decades already; we’ve made fun of Trump for decades. And I think what’s more interesting than Donald Trump, actually, is just the part of the country that voted for him feels ignored and unspoken for; they felt like they needed a Donald Trump. They also watch our show. And this show is for everybody. We’re not here to just play to the college liberal kids. We’re here to play for everybody. And we’ve got to find a way to get everybody to laugh at the same time. ",

      "text": "Welcome to our new-look website . If you are having trouble finding what you need, you can view the traditional format here Advertisement Perth actor Devon Terrell on playing Barack Obama in the Netflix film Barry ICON Entertainment > Sarah Thomas Published: 3 hours ago Larger / Smaller Devon Terrell, the lead in <i>Barry</i> where he plays a young Barack Obama. Photo: Wolter Peeters It's a daunting task playing one of the most powerful men in the world, particularly portraying him as a beer-drinking, weed-smoking, partying undergraduate in the 1980s. And what's even more incredible is that the college-era Barack Obama in the forthcoming Netflix film Barry is played by a 24-year-old NIDA graduate from Perth, for whom it's not only his first feature credit, it's his first-ever acting credit. It's testament to the talent of Devon Terrell that he has scored such a high-profile and challenging role in what is basically his first gig. In Sydney on Tuesday to promote Barry , out next month, Terrell says he didn't allow himself to think about whether he was up to the job. \"I thought if the director says I'm the right person then I'm the right person to tell the story,\" he says. Terrell, who graduated from NIDA in 2013, came to the attention of casting circles after landing the lead in an HBO pilot for director Steve McQueen, which was never made. Despite being an unknown, Terrell, playing an Obama in 1981, an era where he was questioning his path in life, his politics and his identity, is absolutely astounding. Displaying an intensity not seen since the days of Heath Ledger, Terrell inhabits the character with an enthralling, quiet complexity, fleshing out in nuanced but forensic detail an Obama who fitted in nowhere and everywhere, and was powered by a singular sense of drive and integrity amid his identity struggles. Terrell says his preparation was meticulous, including digesting articles, Obama's 1995 memoir Dreams From My Father and footage. Most immediately striking is his pitch-perfect capturing of Obama's distinctive tone and cadence. \"The director [Vikram Gandhi] kept saying it's like this swirl over [Obama's] head,\" says Terrell. \"He's constantly got these ideas and he's trying to make sense of them. That's what we were going for – the stiltedness is a sense of him always wanting to say the right thing in the moment. He never wanted to say something and not mean it.\" In the two months he had to prepare for filming in March, Terrell also taught himself to write left-handed and particularly in the distinctive way Obama curves his hand while holding a pen, as well as training himself to play basketball from the left, too. That aside, Obama is also a natural fit for Terrell, with many parallels between the two. The film depicts Obama struggling with his background: a Kenyan father who he hardly knew, a white hippie mother, and an upbringing in Indonesia and Hawaii. Terrell was born in Long Island, California, to an African-American father and Anglo-Indian mother and moved to Perth age five. \"I read the story and I had such an emotional connection to it and I said that's me, someone just summed up my life,\" he says. \"I've had very similar experiences, moving to Australia and having to change my accent and go to school. And I've never met a person who's Anglo-Indian and African-American.\" In the throes of publicity ahead of its release, Terrell says he keeps getting asked by the US media what a young Obama would say to Trump – \"I hope you do good by the country and I hope you listen to the people,\" is his response. But he adds that he hopes the depiction of Obama's character and early struggles will add to the legacy of the departing president. \"He was such an important figure in terms of breaking the mould and in [creating an] understanding that if you have the intelligence and integrity to want to do good, you can achieve whatever you want to do.\" Terrell also shares a similar sense of integrity. He says he's an \"actor's actor\" and cites Ledger, Marlon Brando and Michael Fassbender among his influences, and will be moving to New York in January, where he's looking at a number of roles. \"I want to be a respected actor around the world and for people to look at my work and to have emotional reactions, and to change things. It's not about the glitz and glam, Every day shooting [Barry], I woke being excited to work,\" he says. \"A lot of acting is, you know, you give up a lot of your life trying to be other people and it reveals stuff about yourself but I think for me it's very much about pushing myself to how good could I become, where can my career take me.\" Barry screened at the Toronto Film Festival in September to hugely positive reviews, particularly about the promise of Terrell, who says he hopes the film sparks discussions about identity. \"Everyone has the right to be who they want to be and I think we're definitely going through a stage where there's so much black or white going on the world and we really need to find conversations to have. I hope Barry is one of those conversations.\" Terrell says he was aware that there were White House representatives at the Toronto screening, but he doesn't know if Barry has made it to the Obamas yet. \"Hopefully their daughters have Netflix in the White House,\" he says, laughing, adding \"I'm sure he's very busy at the moment.\" What does Terrell hope Obama will think of his performance? \"My honest opinion is I hope he goes, 'Yeah, I think you were close enough'.'' Barry streams on Netflix from December 16. ",

      "text": "\nPhoto by Chris Owyoung/Netflix (CC-BY) The seasoned comic breaks down the city that never sleeps. \nIt's a few days after the election, and it still doesn't feel real. Colin Quinn says it won't feel real until we see Trump sitting in the Oval Office. \n“People don't really think of Donald Trump as being from New York. He's from the rich New York. The Upper East Side, Manhattan… That's not really New York. The Bronx, Brooklyn—now that's New York,” Quinn tells the Daily Dot. \n“Did you see him sitting in the White House talking to Obama?” he asks. “He looked like a kid who was in trouble.” \nQuinn, who grew up in the Bronx, is an expert on New York City. He proves it in his Netflix special Colin Quinn: The New York Story, explaining the city's characters at a break-neck pace and chronologically detailing its rich history of immigration. He makes fun of people from different regions of the U.S., but quickly centers back to his home state and asks: “How did all these cultures come together to make the New York attitude?” \nThe special, directed by fellow New Yorker Jerry Seinfeld, attempts to answer that question, all without utilizing a single prop from the meticulously decorated set behind him. This is Quinn’s fifth one-man show and the special is based off his book The Coloring Book: A Comedian Solves Race Relations in America, published in 2015. \nQuinn has come a long way since his time as one of the first MTV spring break VJ s, and the unforgettable jerky boy-voiced announcer from the early ‘90s game show Remote Control . Or from his stint as the Weekend Update anchor on Saturday Night Live . Or even recently, when Quinn played Amy Schumer 's dad in the movie Trainwreck. \nThese days he stars in his own webseries, Cop Show , where he plays himself playing a bad actor who plays a New York cop. His humor is lived in, delightfully cynical, and it savors the process. \nIt's trusted and earned, too: Quinn found his voice in the New York comedy scene alongside Chris Rock and Adam Sandler. \n“We went to all kinds of open mics,” he says. “We used to bomb all the time. It's incremental. Comedy is different than I thought it was going to be. I always thought I would understand it one day and say to myself, 'Oh, I get it now. This is the way to do it.' But that day never happens.” \nQuinn says that being sober for almost 40 years has helped. He says not drinking makes you have to confront yourself. Some of it is about facing the pain of life and some of it is just facing its boredom. When you're bored you have to find out what you're really about, and what you really want to do with yourself. \nIt's this “strange life,” as he puts it, that led him to Lower Manhattan's Schimmel Center, where he paces the stage fast-forwarding through a history lesson about the people who reside in city that never sleeps. New Yorkers are rude, opinionated, pushy, loud, fast-talking, and sarcastic. And those are just a few of their qualities, he says. Quinn uses a lot of stereotypes to examine the attitude of a New Yorker, and in doing so makes a brilliant point about how times have changed. \n“You just can’t tell jokes like you used to,” he says. \nColin Quinn: The New York Story is streaming on Netflix.

      "text": "Following Dave Chapelle’s recent highly-anticipated return to television hosting Saturday Night Live a few weeks ago, the comedian announced that he will release three new stand-up specials on Netflix next year. Variety has the story as Chapelle is coming off a strong performance as host of “Saturday Night Live,” which generated the show’s highest ratings in three years. He is among the most prolific and successful touring comics in the country, staging some 500 shows during the past three years. The trio of Chapelle shows includes one new original set and two never-aired live performances from Chapelle’s vault, one produced out of the Austin City Limits Live venue, the other from a performance at the Hollywood Palladium. The new special marks Chapelle’s first in 12 years (since Dave Chapelle’s Block Party came out in 2005.) No air date has been announced, but the specials will appear on Netflix simultaneously.\nNetflix recently reached a two-comedy special deal with Chapelle’s friend Chris Rock in October paying him 40 million. A couple of other very funny stand up shows are on Netflix now: Dana Carvey’s Straight White Male :60 and Colin Quinn’s The New York Story. \n",

      "title": "Get to Know Netflix's Zuul Cloud",
      "text": "Zuul is the front door for all requests from devices and websites to the backend of the Netflix streaming application. As an edge service application, Zuul is built to enable dynamic routing, monitoring, resiliency, and security. \n\nRouting is an integral part of a microservice architecture. For example,  /api/users  is mapped to the user service and  /api/shop  is mapped to the shop service. Zuul is a JVM-based router and server side load balancer by Netflix.\nThe volume and diversity of Netflix API traffic sometimes results in production issues arising quickly and without warning. We need a system that allows us to rapidly change behavior in order to react to these situations.\nZuul uses a range of different types of filters that enables us to quickly and nimbly apply functionality to our edge service. These filters help us perform the following functions: \nAuthentication and Security:  identifying authentication requirements for each resource. Insights and Monitoring : tracking meaningful data and statistics. Dynamic Routing:  dynamically routing requests to different backend.. Stress Testing:  gradually increasing the traffic. Load Shedding:  allocating capacity for each type of request and dropping requests. Static Response handling:  building some responses directly. Multiregion Resiliency:  routing requests across AWS regions. Zuul contains multiple components:\nzuul-core:  library that contains the core functionality of compiling and executing Filters. zuul-simple-webapp:  webapp that shows a simple example of how to build an application with zuul-core. zuul-netflix : library that adds other NetflixOSS components to Zuul — using Ribbon for routing requests, for example. zuul-netflix-webapp:  webapp which packages zuul-core and zuul-netflix together into an easy to use package. Zuul gives us a lot of insight, flexibility, and resiliency, in part by making use of other Netflix OSS components:\nHystrix  is used to wrap calls to our origins, which allows us to shed and prioritize traffic when issues occur. Ribbon  is our client for all outbound requests from Zuul, which provides detailed information into network performance and errors, as well as handles software load balancing for even load distribution. Turbine  aggregates fine­grained metrics in real­time so that we can quickly observe and react to problems. Archaius  handles configuration and gives the ability to dynamically change properties.\nWe can create a filter to route a specific customer or device to a separate API cluster for debugging. Prior to using Zuul, we were using Hadoop to query through billions of logged requests to find the several thousand requests we were interested in.\nWe have an automated process that uses dynamic Archaius configurations within a Zuul filter to steadily increase the traffic routed to a small cluster of origin servers. As the instances receive more traffic, we measure their performance characteristics and capacity.\nSpring Cloud  has created an  embedded Zuul proxy  to ease the development of a very common use case where a UI application wants to proxy calls to one or more back end services. This feature is useful for a user interface to proxy to the backend services it requires, avoiding the need to manage  CORS  and authentication concerns independently for all the backends.\nTo enable it, annotate a  Spring Boot  main class with  @EnableZuulProxy , and this forwards local calls to the appropriate service. By convention, a service with the ID \"users\", will receive requests from the proxy located at /users.\nThe proxy uses  Ribbon  to locate an instance to forward to via discovery, and all requests are executed in a hystrix command, so failures will show up in  Hystrix  metrics, and once the circuit is open the proxy will not try to contact the service.\nZuul Request Lifecycle \n\n\nIn this picture, it is possible check that, before accessing the origin server, Zuul provides some functionality to add in requests or after requests (responses), like filtering, routing, aggregation, error treatment, etc.\nIn my sample, I implemented filter/routing with Zuul. I have  two components  in this sample, service and Zuul.\nService will provide some operations:\n@RestController @SpringBootApplicationpublic class BookApplication { @RequestMapping(value = \"/available\") public String available() { return \"Spring in Action\"; } @RequestMapping(value = \"/checked-out\") public String checkedOut() { return \"Spring Boot in Action\"; } public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(BookApplication.class, args); } } \nspring.application.name=book server.port=8090 \n\n\nZuul Service @EnableZuulProxy @SpringBootApplication public class GatewayApplication { public static void main(String[] args) { SpringApplication.run(GatewayApplication.class, args); } @Bean public SimpleFilter simpleFilter() { return new SimpleFilter(); } } public class SimpleFilter extends ZuulFilter { private static Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(SimpleFilter.class); @Override public String filterType() { return \"pre\"; } @Override public int filterOrder() { return 1; } @Override public boolean shouldFilter() { return true; } @Override public Object run() { RequestContext ctx = RequestContext.getCurrentContext(); HttpServletRequest request = ctx.getRequest(); log.info(String.format(\"%s request to %s\", request.getMethod(), request.getRequestURL().toString())); return null; } } \n\n\nzuul.routes.books.url=http://localhost:8090 ribbon.eureka.enabled=false server.port=8080 \n\n\nWith  Zuul  and  book service  working together, we can access the operations  available  and  checked-out  across  http://localhost:8080/books .\nSample http://localhost:8080/books/available  should have the same result as  http://localhost:8090/available .

The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Home / News / Desktop PC News / 4K Netflix comes to Windows 10 PCs, but you probably can't use it 4K Netflix comes to Windows 10 PCs, but you probably can't use it \nby Joe Roberts Read Comments \nUntil now, 4K Netflix streaming has been limited to specific Ultra HD TVs and set top boxes, while the humble PC has lagged behind. \nNow, Microsoft has announced Windows 10 users will finally be able to watch shows in glorious 4K on their PCs, but there's a few caveats. \nIn fact, those caveats will likely mean that you're unable to take advantage of UHD Netflix content on your device. \nFirst of all you need the very latest 7th generation (Kaby Lake) Intel Core processor, in your PC – and as of right now there are very few devices that use the chips. \nRelated: Best PC \nThe requirement means that not even the new Surface Studio , which features a 4,500 x 3,000 display, can stream Netflix in 4K. \nYou'll also need to make sure you're using Microsoft's Edge browser to watch the higher resolution streams, as well as a 4K montor, as there doesn't seem to be an option to watch 4K on QHD or Full HD screens. \nThat immediately rules out most laptops, as UHD screens are far from ubiquitous on notebooks at this point in time. \nMicrosoft is using the advent of 4K on PC to promote its Edge browser, and has provided a new blog post where it's trying to entice viewers to make the switch with the tempting offer of watching Gilmore Girls in all its 4K glory. \nRelated: What is 4K? \nWe're not sure Gilmore Girls is a good enough reason to invest in an upgrade to a Kaby Lake chip, but it may convince a few users who've been considering an upgrade. \nIn reality, the requirement for Intel's latest processors is likely down to the fact that the chips support the HDCP 2.2 protocol, which prevents users copying 4K video. \nIt seems that DRM is behind this very limited UHD-on-PC rollout then, as content providers have strict rules when it comes to 4K playback. \nStill, it's a welcome development, and we hope to see full Netflix 4K streaming arrive on the PC (and hopefully Mac) in the very near future. \nWatch The Refresh: The best tech gossip and reviews every week \nLet us know if you've tested out 4K on your PC yet in the comments. 0 shares",

      "text": "Windows 10 Users Get Exclusive Access to 4K Content from Netflix You still need a compatible device to watch it though Nov 22, 2016 10:42 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft has just announced that Windows 10 adopters can now enjoy exclusive 4K video support on Netflix using Edge browser, which comes by default on all devices running the latest OS. Although this is pretty good news for Netflix subscribers, not everyone can enjoy the 4K quality, even if they’re running Windows 10. According to Microsoft itself, you need a Windows 10 device that supports 4K, and this includes a system with a 4K-capable display plus a 7th-generation Intel Core processor. Microsoft used this occasion to emphasize how good its Edge browser actually is as compared to competition, explaining that using it to watch content on Netflix provides you with longer battery life than Google Chrome (which for some reason has become its main target for browser ads and benchmarks). “When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery – and you know one episode can be the difference between Chris and Lorelai casually dating and being a married couple,” the company explained . More recently, the company rolled out Microsoft Edge ads to emphasize that its browser is faster and more secure than Google Chrome , so this little remark doesn’t come as a big surprise. Of course, 4K content is only available for Netflix subscribers whose plans include Ultra HD quality, and depends on some other factors too, including Internet service, device capabilities, and content availability.",

      "text": "Enlarge (credit: Orange Is The New Black, Netflix)\nNetflix 4K streaming is coming to Windows PCs later this week—but only for the lucky few using seventh generation Kaby Lake processors from Intel.\nNetflix launched 4K streaming in 2014 on a select number of TVs before rolling it out to dedicated streaming boxes like the Amazon Fire TV , Roku , and Nvidia Shield . 4K streaming on PC was notably missing from the rollout, due in part to piracy and DRM concerns from Hollywood studios and TV networks.\nIn an effort to placate the studios, Microsoft introduced \"PlayReady 3.0\" with the Windows 10 Anniversary update . PlayReady 3.0 is a hardware-based DRM (digital rights management) system that requires dedicated decoding hardware, either on the CPU or on the graphics card, preventing the video stream from being captured in software or via an external capture device.\nRead 3 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "text": "4K Netflix is finally coming to PCs, but you probably still can’t watch it 4K Netflix is finally coming to PCs, but you probably still can’t watch it By Joel Hruska on November 22, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment \nChalk this one up as mildly infuriating. In the past, we’ve covered Netflix’s 4K streaming limitations and how the platform was limited to handful of televisions, even though PCs are easily capable of handling 4K. Now we know that 4K content is officially coming to the PC with the release of some Gilmore Girls episodes in partnership with Microsoft, but chances are you can’t watch it in that mode. To view 4K Netflix, you’ll need a Windows 10 PC, Microsoft Edge , and a seventh-generation processor from Intel. \nGiven that Kaby Lake is so new that neither Microsoft nor Apple could be arsed to include it in their own recent hardware refreshes, making 4K Netflix content depend on it is icing on the cake — particularly given that there’s going to be essentially zero benefit from stepping up to 4K as opposed to 1080p on an 11-15-inch laptop display. (As always, the benefits of higher resolution content depend on how close you sit to the display, but relatively small laptop and tablet screens won’t see dramatic gains). It’d be interesting to see how Netflix’s 4K compares with 1080p from Blu-ray, both native and upscaled to 4K, though that’s a question for another day. \nMicrosoft’s blog post on the topic directs readers to check the Microsoft Store for more information on which systems qualify as 4K capable. The link redirects to one system — the Lenovo Yoga 910. After Lenovo’s disastrous security issues, I no longer recommend Lenovo hardware for any reason. It scarcely matters. This is one capability that may technically exist today, but it’ll be months before hardware is widely available to take advantage of it — and it’ll never come to previous generation hardware at all. Why you can’t stream Netflix 4K on previous-generation hardware \nIn a word: DRM . There are strict new hardware requirements for 4K streaming, and while some of these features might come to desktops if GPU support is implemented by AMD and Nvidia, it looks as though content creators intend to lock them to CPU features, at least for now. There are unknown implications here — owning the latest Polaris and Pascal GPUs from AMD and Nvidia apparently isn’t enough to convince DRM authors to allow the content to play on that hardware, which suggests that CPU implementation may be mandatory. This, in turn, may mean that we won’t see support for PC 4K Netflix playback until Zen APUs ship — Bristol Ridge support isn’t mentioned anywhere on Microsoft’s page. For now, only Intel Kaby Lake chips appear capable of supporting Netflix 4K support, even though AMD and Nvidia have always implemented DRM support in their respective GPUs and APUs. \nI wouldn’t spend too much time blaming content studios, however. Netflix is clearly locking off its own TV shows in the same fashion, and while it can’t mandate that Sony or Universal release content that supports 4K without DRM lockouts, it could release its own programs in a less-obnoxious format. And Intel and AMD aren’t going to complain either, given how the PC market continues to collapse. Giving people reason to upgrade their hardware has gotten difficult of late, and no manufacturer is going to cry if people have to buy equipment after 3-5 years, when replacement cycles used to be driven in half that time.

      "title": "Netflix 4K streaming comes to the PC—but it needs Kaby Lake CPU",
      "text": "Netflix 4K streaming is coming to Windows PCs later this week—but only for the lucky few using seventh generation Kaby Lake processors from Intel.\nNetflix launched 4K streaming in 2014 on a select number of TVs before rolling it out to dedicated streaming boxes like the Amazon Fire TV , Roku , and Nvidia Shield . 4K streaming on PC was notably missing from the rollout, due in part to piracy and DRM concerns from Hollywood studios and TV networks.\nIn an effort to placate the studios, Microsoft introduced \"PlayReady 3.0\" with the Windows 10 Anniversary update . PlayReady 3.0 is a hardware-based DRM (digital rights management) system that requires dedicated decoding hardware, either on the CPU or on the graphics card, preventing the video stream from being captured in software or via an external capture device.\nThere's also the matter of hardware decoding support for 10-bit HEVC, the 4K codec used by Netflix and other streaming services. Currently, only Intel's seventh generation Kaby Lake processors support 10-bit HEVC decoding. Older sixth generation Skylake CPUs only support 8-bit HEVC decoding. Technically, Nvidia's 10-series graphics cards—including the GTX 1080 , GTX 1070 , and GTX 1060 —feature 10-bit HEVC decoding and PlayReady 3.0 support, but aren't listed as compatible.\nFurther Reading Chromecast Ultra review: Delivers 4K and HDR content, but is that enough? And then there's the browser: 4K streaming only works in Microsoft Edge, because it's the only browser that supports PlayReady DRM. Basically, streaming 4K Netflix on a PC requires a CPU that's in barely any devices right now (desktop chips aren't expected until sometime in 2017), the latest version of Windows 10, and using an unpopular browser, making it a largely useless feature.\nWho says DRM is bad for consumers, eh?\nThis post originated on Ars Technica UK",

      "text": "A A \nWriting about Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (starts streaming Netflix on Friday) is a slippery task. There’s a confidentiality/embargo agreement which precludes giving “storyline information,” so some specifics can’t be revealed. \nAnd then there’s the whole matter of the show’s appeal. It’s review-proof, critic-resistant and utterly anchored in its appeal to a fanatical fan base. That means that what reviews say don’t matter at all. \nWell and good. But let’s steam ahead, regardless. Why does Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life even exist? Good question and I’m glad you asked. As a character in the four-part series says, while doing a spot of decluttering, “If it brings you joy, you keep it, and if it doesn’t, you throw it out.” The original Gilmore Girls series brought joy to its fans, and while it was thrown out by the original broadcaster, it deserves being retrieved. \nThat’s the upshot. But, as anyone who has covered TV for more than five minutes can attest, Gilmore Girls was never a hit show. It never made the Top 10 most-watched list. It was a minor cult show. \nHere’s the thing – Gilmore Girls went off the air in 2007 and its ending coincided with the arrival and rise of social media. A show that had a small but loyal audience suddenly seemed bigger, more profoundly missed than it was in any true sense. It seemed to be in the Top 10 most-missed shows. This was an illusion but the attention drew people to the show online and in box-set DVDs and the result, thanks to social media, was an apparent hunger for more. \nAlong comes Netflix and it is part of its business model to satisfy hunger for shows that nobody else has the inclination to revive. Thanks to Netflix’s savvy use of social media promotion, suddenly the return of Gilmore Girls seems to be the TV event of the year. \nIt isn’t – the show is charming but shallow; silly but not utterly trivial. \nThe new series begins with admirable breeziness. The familiar and cheery theme music starts and before you can say, “Oh, look, Stars Hollow hasn’t changed,” you realize that really nothing has changed. Everybody is a bit older but behaving the same way. Mom Lorelai (Lauren Graham) has the first of her many cups of coffee, daughter Rory (Alexis Bledel) arrives and immediately there is all the banter, fast quips and pop-culture references that fans and admirers expect. It’s nice. Really nice. \nBut if you’re not a fan you might be taken aback by Lorelai saying, “Haven’t done that for a while!” It’s a wink to the audience, a self-consciously cute acknowledgment that the old gang is back and delighted to be doing it. \nThe gist, such as it is, involves both mother and daughter re-examining their lives and, maybe, making changes. Lorelai claims she’s happy but, you know, she and her chap could be a little happier still. Rory seems to have had a successful career but now that she’s in her 30s, she got a touch of the mopes. “This is my time to be rootless,” she declares. \nAnd, of course, her mom’s comeback is, “She’s Jack Kerouac. Pass the peyote.” \nThus, if you’re an admirer, you know that this revival delivers exactly what you wanted – the same jolly, vaguely witty and wise banter. And yes, almost every male character from past entanglements returns, too. Otherwise, there wouldn’t be much point in putting Lorelai and Rory back together for further mother-daughter adventures. \nGilmore Girls was and is ersatz drama of a very middling grade – enjoyable and aspirational, glib but not self-important. What strength it had was in the occasional outbreaks of pain, when the characters sometimes spoke with an authenticity of emotion that seemed at odds with the cozy, little, oddball-filled town of Stars Hollow surrounding them. That grain of strength is there, too. \nNo one can begrudge fans of the show getting more. The revival was fanned by social media and, like a lot of things on social media, the reality isn’t that important at all. Follow John Doyle on Twitter: @MisterJohnDoyle",

      "text": "YouTube / Comedy Central\n\nNetflix has shelled out a cool $100 million in the past month to Dave Chappelle and Chris Rock for a combined 5 stand-up specials. $60 million of that will go straight into the bank of Dave Chappelle after his enormously successful appearance as the host of Saturday Night Live two weeks ago, and he’ll only have to perform three stand-up specials (his first in 12 years) to get all of that money.\nSome people work their entire lives and never make a million dollars, Dave Chappelle will make $20 million for a night on the stage, and he’ll do that three times over.\nIf you’ve never seen Dave Chappelle perform stand-up and only know him from Chappelle Show , here’s some footage from Killing Them Softly , which is arguably Dave’s most commercially successful stand-up show to date:\n\nPageSix reports that Netflix keeps a ‘war chest’ for this type of content. Stating that even if Netflix takes a loss on deals like this, which it is almost certain to, the financial windfall they see from new subscribers because of exclusive stand-up specials and the press they get surrounding unique content like this more than makes up for the loss Netflix might take on an individual deal.\nRELATED: The Netflix Adds And Drops For The Month Of December 2016 Are Absolutely ‘Marvelous’ The good news for Dave Chappelle fans is typically these large stand-up specials are accompanied by world tours where the comedians perfect their stage acts before the big night. So if I was a betting man I’d wager that we see multiple Dave Chappelle comedy tours announced over the next year or so.\n[h/t PageSix ] \nShare This\n",

      "title": "Netflix announces 3 Dave Chappelle stand-up specials coming in 2017",
      "text": "After an unbearably long hiatus from stand-up specials and his acclaimed sketch series, Dave Chappelle is making a much-needed return to comedy. Netflix announced Monday that the comedian is going to have three stand-up specials that will air in 2017. Interestingly, the specials will be released simultaneously on the streaming service — and two are coming from his \"personal comedy vault\" — though their release date remains TBD.\n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's vice president of original documentary and comedy told the Hollywood Reporter . \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\"\nNews: 3 new Dave Chappelle comedy specials, coming soon.\nhttps://pbs.twimg.com/media/CxzSMt3VIAAEjjz.jpg:large Chappelle has mostly avoided the spotlight since Chappelle's Show ended in 2006, stepping out of the public eye to live quietly with his family in South Africa. However, we're seeing a bit of a resurgence of the comedian since his widely praised Saturday Night Live hosting debut following Donald Trump's election win. Chappelle's opening monologue addressed the forthcoming Trump presidency by vowing to give the real estate mogul a shot, with the very important distinction that he does the same for marginalized groups.\n\"In that spirit, I'm wishing Donald Trump luck, and I'm gonna give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one, too,\" he said.\nSource: Saturday Night Live/YouTube This is the type of social commentary we've come to expect from Chappelle: sometimes controversial — like when he criticized Black Lives Matter as a slogan — but consistently hilarious and topical in his subject matter. But in the early age of Trump, come 2017, we certainly welcome more of his comedic input.",

      "text": "Home > Trading > Trading Advice > 2 Ways to Collect on Netflix, Inc. (NFLX) Stock Netflix stock struggled in the post-election tech selloff, but NFLX is poised to stream higher as buyers return By Joseph Hargett , InvestorPlace Contributor | Nov 22, 2016, 9:16 am EST View All Posts \nThere hasn’t been much to cheer about for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ: NFLX ) shareholders since the company’s quarterly earnings report. Netflix stock has been rejected by technical resistance and plagued by the post-election selloff in the tech sector. All told, NFLX has fallen nearly 10% since late October. \nClick to Enlarge However, with support holding firm near $110 heading into an historic month of growth for the broader market, now might be the right time to revisit bullish positions on NFLX options. \nTechnically speaking, Netflix stock is showing signs of life after pulling back to support in the $100 region. NFLX, bolstered by its rising 50-day moving average, has quietly added more than 4% in the past week. \nShares have reclaimed their 10-day moving average in the process, and have set their sites on $120 and their 20-day trendline. A move above this region would confirm that the bounce from $110 has legs to run further. \nThere is a bullish trend budding for Netflix stock on the sentiment front as well. \nFor instance, the number of bullish analysts crept higher last week, after Brean Capital initiated NFLX stock with a “buy” rating and a $145 price target. At last check, Zacks reports that 18 of the 32 analysts following Netflix stock now rate the shares a “buy” or better. \nThe 12-month consensus price target, meanwhile, rests at $123.13 — a far cry from Brean’s $145 target, but just a stone’s throw from NFLX’s current perch. In other words, there is ample room for additional upgrades or price-target increases. \nBullish sentiment also is on the rise within the options pits. In fact, Netflix stock has seen its December put/call open interest ratio fall from a reading near 1.06 to its current perch at 0.90. Puts are still near parity with calls among short-term options, but rising call activity could have bullish implications for the shares.",

      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life Next Up The Walking Dead : What's Next for Daryl? \nIt's fitting that Gilmore Girls , a charming and lighthearted series exploring the complicated relationships between three generations of women, has captured the hearts of a new generation of viewers 16 years after it debuted on The WB. Since the show's original seven-season run popped up on Netflix in October 2014, it has attracted more soon-to-be-overly-caffeinated young women to its cause through a simple central premise involving a mother and daughter who are also best friends. It's a set up that is essential to the success of the series -- and a theme that drives much of the narrative in Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life (Friday, Nov. 25) -- but it is also largely tied to a different era of TV. \nGilmore Girls debuted at the height of The WB alongside other iconic and influential pop culture programs that Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ) and Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) likely would have referenced (and probably have), including Buffy the Vampire Slayer , Dawson's Creek and Felicity . But by the time the show's then-series finale aired in May 2007, the so-called Golden Age of TV was already moving on to a darker, more complex era that would be dominated by the morally bankrupt stories of male antiheroes. Those worlds didn't line up with the Gilmores, their small New England town or their perfectly measured whimsy and staccato-like banter. Lorelai and Rory and the simple elegance of their existence, where Friday night dinners could be every bit as tense as whatever perilous situation Walter White found himself in, gave way to some of the most celebrated shows the medium has ever seen. And now, with more quality viewing options than ever before, it's a happy delight that the Gilmores have somehow managed to endure through it all. \nGilmore Girls : What's the same? What's different? What you need to know Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nFor many young women, the rhythm of the Gilmores and their pop culture-laced dialogue was the soundtrack to the early 2000s. We experienced Rory's milestones alongside her, viewing the youngest Lorelai as a slightly annoying and sometimes frustratingly inaccessible woman but otherwise a worthwhile and respectable peer. Her idyllic life with her mother in Stars Hollow, a picturesque Connecticut town morphed into a world too bright and whimsical to exist anywhere outside the pages of one of Rory's favorite books, was an escape. \nToday Gilmore Girls remains just that. It is a much-needed break from the bleak cynicism and brutality that once defined the best of the best. And Netflix's four new episodes are coming at just the right time to act as a happy reprieve from the tumultuous political landscape of the real world that is currently filling the airwaves and the Internet with horrifying examples of hate and vitriol. If you need a break from the madness, there's a rambling Lorelai monologue to help with that. If you want to escape to a world where Paris Geller ( Liza Weil ) is the most terrifying thing in existence, you just have to push a button. It's all right there. \nGilmore Girls ' Alexis Bledel reveals where Rory is when the show returns \nFor many long-time fans, this coda will be everything they could have hoped and dreamed, and with series creator Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband and collaborator Daniel Palladino beside her on this journey (Amy wrote the first and fourth episodes, while Dan tackled two and three), that was probably to be expected. The series has always been the singular vision of one wild and amazing woman, and when the Palladinos departed the series amid contract disputes following Season 6, that vision slowly faltered without the woman who created it and nurtured it into the pop culture obsession it eventually became. Lauren Graham and Kelly Bishop, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nStepping back onto the familiar streets of Stars Hollow, with its never-ending festivals, colorful townspeople and old-fashioned diners (with or without wi-fi), is a comforting reminder of a simpler and happier life. It is a world in which friendship and family, whether strengthened by healthy relationships or strained by decade-long unspoken resentments, get top billing. In the opening moments of \"Winter,\" the first chapter of this new era, Sherman-Palladino's voice and signature rapid-fire dialogue is back with renewed energy. The episode quickly wraps viewers up like a warm blanket and refuses to loosen its grip even when the threat of suffocation becomes real. Meanwhile, Graham, Bledel and Kelly Bishop all slip easily back into their roles in a way that suggests maybe, just maybe these complicated, powerful and independent women and the world they inhabit continued to exist offscreen in the years since we last saw them. They are the women we've always known, familiar faults and all. \nIn the interest of keeping this a spoiler-free review -- not just because our Netflix overlords demand it but because I don't dare take away an ounce of future joy from my fellow fans -- it's safe to say that Lorelai is still the same woman we all wished had been our mother only now she's a decade older and in a stable relationship, and Rory is still Rory, for better or for worse. That is to say if you found her personality and actions frustrating before she'll likely be frustrating here, in large part because despite a travel-heavy lifestyle that has taken her firmly out of the sheltered but comfortable world of Stars Hollow, she hasn't grown all that much between 22 and 32. Rory is in a bit of a holding pattern when the series returns, and it's hard to imagine a woman with her talents experiencing the sort of problems she comes up against here. \nStill, there's also a sense of satisfaction in knowing these characters haven't lost something in the decade between the Season 7 finale and now. Rory is still chasing her dreams; Lorelai is still a complicated ball of energy and emotions; and Emily is still the headstrong matriarch. But there's one obvious thing that's missing, and that is Edward Herrmann 's Richard (the inimitable actor passed away in 2014). The significance of his death is far-reaching and although he is gone, his presence remains to influence each of the Gilmore women in a different way, even inspiring them, much the same way he did -- or tried to do -- when he was alive. \nGilmore Girls ' Milo Ventimiglia tries (and fails) to defend Jess \nElsewhere, everyone's favorite wacky characters return, including Melissa McCarthy 's Sookie St. James, Sean Gunn 's inexplicable but lovable Kirk and Liza Weil's Paris Geller, a one-woman hurricane and a true gift we've never really deserved. Each of Rory's former boyfriends makes an appearance, and despite their circumstances in the present, their presence in her life will likely bring about a new round of \"Which Boyfriend Is Better for Rory?\" because that's apparently what we do now. The misplaced importance of arguing about Dean ( Jared Padalecki ), Jess ( Milo Ventimiglia ) and Logan ( Matt Czuchry ) and their place in Rory's life has become one of the few constants with the exception of Lorelai's relationship with Luke ( Scott Patterson ) despite continued insistence from Sherman-Palladino that Rory's love life is actually not what's most important here. And she's right of course, but we probably shouldn't expect these new episodes to change anything despite the fact they very much do. \nUnfortunately, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life isn't without its flaws. In addition to the curious stagnation of Rory Gilmore, the new episodes all struggle with pacing, specifically as it relates to the passing of time. Each 90-minute outing covers an entire season of the year so that altogether they depict a year in the life of these women -- hence the show's subtitle -- but without this knowledge, it's just as easy to believe each covers just a few weeks' time. It makes for confusing arrivals and departures, a few instances of character growth that don't feel wholly earned and a few too many familiar faces popping up just because Team Palladino wanted to bring back as many people as possible (lookin' at you, Jason Stiles). \nHowever, it ultimately doesn't matter. At the end of the day, what determines success will be how the fans react, and it feels so good to be back in Stars Hollow after nearly a decade away that the good greatly outweighs the questionable or even the bad. And truthfully, four episodes with the Gilmores probably won't be enough for most fans. It wasn't for me and it apparently wasn't enough for Sherman-Palladino, who told reporters during the Television Critics Association press tour earlier this year that after worrying she wouldn't have enough story found she wasn't actually able to include everything she wanted. But what we've got is pretty darn great, and more importantly, it's the ending Sherman-Palladino has always envisioned for her girls, right down to the now infamous final four words. It's hard to argue there's anything wrong with that, so despite the obvious problems and although it's still unclear whether or not this is really the end of the road, it doesn't matter. We're all incredibly lucky to have this chance to follow where the Gilmores lead one last heartwarming, emotional time. At least until we all re-watch it again next week. \nAll four 90-minute episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premiere Friday, Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "Joanne Eglash \nGilmore Girls fans were thrilled when they learned about Netflix’s revival of the show, but they had to wait in suspense before confirmation of Melissa McCarthy’s reprisal of her role as Sookie. Now, her co-stars and the showrunner are spilling the details of Melissa’s return, but sharp-eyed fans just might notice something else when they watch McCarthy glow in the show. She’s become a celebrity weight loss winner, shedding 75 pounds. . @GilmoreGirls Revival: Team Palladino Talk Melissa McCarthy's 11th Hour Return as Sookie: 'The Weird Thing Was…' https://t.co/mtE3URApts pic.twitter.com/v4XnSR2Lxj \n— Michael Ausiello (@MichaelAusiello) November 20, 2016 \nGilmore Girls is headed up by Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, and Amy told TVLine that they made the most of McCarthy’s reprisal of Sookie in the revival, whose full title is Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \n“We had [Melissa McCarthy] for one day and of course we threw her, like, a 10-page scene, because, why not?” \nAt the premiere for the four-part, six-hour revival, which Netflix will debut on November 25, showrunner Sherman-Palladino also shared that Melissa made it clear that she was eager for the challenge.

[Image by Jason Merritt/Getty Images for Lane Bryant] \n“She did say, ‘Bring it,'” added Amy. “And we brought it.” \nDrama prevailed during the period when it was not certain whether McCarthy would be able to fit filming for Gilmore Girls into her busy schedule, but there wasn’t any drama when Melissa stepped on set, emphasized the showrunner. \n“The weird thing was, she walked on [sporting Sookie’s signature] ponytails, with the chef thing and [everything] sort of clicked back into the way it was,” revealed Amy.

[Image by Paul Conrad/Getty Images for Nordstrom] \n“[Melissa McCarthy] was just delightful.” \nAs for the suspense about whether Melissa would return, Digital Spy pointed out that in the years that have passed since Gilmore Girls’ original last show, she has become a “major movie star,” even becoming the first female recipient of a Comedy Genius Award . \nAs a result, it initially appeared that McCarthy would not be able to co-star in the Gilmore Girls revival on Netflix, and even when she did manage to work it into her busy schedule, she had just one day to make it count. But Melissa expressed just how much she appreciated her return. \n“I got so sentimental going back to those sets and seeing everybody.” \nMcCarthy shared that picking up the original rhythm of the show happened “quickly,” terming it “really amazing.” She views the timing as “perfect,” admitting that she had “really, really missed everybody and really missed those characters.” Melissa also offered a prediction for how Gilmore Girls fans will react when the show drops on Netflix on November 25. \n“People will be really happy with the scripts.” \nBut suspense remains when it comes to those Gilmore Girls scripts , particularly when it comes to those famous “Final Four Words,” as E! News noted. Inside the lore of Gilmore Girls' infamous final four words: https://t.co/1OLmGWbdl0 pic.twitter.com/PQpswfQ5cg \n— E! News (@enews) November 22, 2016 \nHere’s what Sherman-Palladino has to say. \n“It would be great if people who wanted to see the last four words first got some therapy first and got rid of that inclination,” recommended the showrunner. \nRather than fast-forward to the end, she hopes that Gilmore Girls viewers will “want to take the whole trip,” she urged. \n“It’s a fun trip. It’s worth it.” \nAnd while the final four words of the revival remain a mystery, the secrets of McCarthy’s dramatic 75-pound weight loss are out. The Gilmore Girls star has credited her weight loss success to a high protein, low carb diet along with exercise. #GilmoreGirls #MelissaMcCarthy Weight Loss Update: Shed 75 Lbs with Low-Carb Diet,Intense Workout https://t.co/snU3q3QwgR @foods4betterhlt \n— Foods4BetterHealth (@foods4betterhlt) November 5, 2016 \nMelissa once topped the scales at 236 pounds , according to Foods4BetterHealth . She then turned to a high protein, low carb weight loss diet to take off 75 pounds and followed a healthy lifestyle that included exercise. The media outlet told readers that McCarthy drank weight loss smoothies made of greens and sipped both green tea and water with lemon. \nThe comedienne’s weight loss meals reportedly included a variety of protein, from turkey to grass-fed beef to eggs, along with fiber-rich fruits, vegetables and nuts. She also ate healthy fats such as avocado and followed a fitness regime ranging from resistance training to cardiovascular workouts. \nAs for what motivated the Gilmore Girls star to win her weight loss war, Shape magazine cited a source close to McCarthy who revealed that she wanted to provide her children with a good role model. \n“[Melissa] realized she wasn’t being as healthy as she could be. She wants to set a good example for her kids.” \nThe media outlet, which also reported that McCarthy credits her weight loss to a high protein diet, noted that the insider said the Gilmore Girls star “knows that fans love her big and beautiful.” And rather than being “obsessed with dieting,” she is seeking a “happy medium,” added the source. \n“[Melissa] wants to be around to become a grandmother too,” revealed the insider. \n[Featured Image by Gerardo Mora/Getty Images for HSN]",

      "text": "Before he became the Commander-in-Chief, Barack Obama was a New York college student named Barry . As his second term draws to a close, Netflix is readying Vikram Gandhi’s timely biopic for release on December 16, and today brings forth a closer look at Gandhi’s portrait of the outgoing president.\nWhereas Southside With You chronicled the formative years of Obama’s relationship with Michelle Robinson, Barry rolls back the years to 1981, at a time when the would-be POTUS enrolled in Columbia University. A budding junior with lofty ambitions, this latest Netflix original chronicles Obama’s formative relationships and friendships, with many unfolding within a “crime-ridden and racially charged environment.”\nIndeed we’ve already caught a glimpse of Aussie actor Devon Terrell in the title role via previous teasers but here, Terrell commands the screen, delivering a performance that captures the rousing voice and even mannerisms of Barack Obama remarkably well. Hopefully that shines through across the entirety of Barry , where Terrell will be joined by The Witch breakout Anya Taylor-Joy, Jason Mitchell, Ellar Coltrane, Ashley Judd, and Jenna Elfman.\nFeaturing a script penned by Adam Mansbach, Netflix sums up its imminent biopic as so:\nA young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.\nBarry drops via Netflix on December 16, and will act as a welcome primer ahead of Barack Obama’s final day in office on January 19, 2017.\n",

      "text": "4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge 4K Netflix on Windows 10 Requires Kaby Lake Chip and Microsoft Edge 10 Comments Your PC probably needs a processor upgrade to stream Netflix at 4K. \nBlack Friday will be the perfect opportunity to pick up a 4K TV at a healthy discount applied, but it's not just TVs that have embraced 4K resolutions, monitors have, too. However, you may be surprised to find that owning a 4K monitor doesn't necessarily mean you can watch 4K content on your PC. And in the case of Netflix, chances are you probably can't. \nThis week, Netflix and Microsoft are rolling out support for 4K streaming on Windows 10 . But your current PC, however powerful, probably won't be compatible. As The Verge points out , in order for Netflix 4K streams to work you're going to need Intel's latest 7th-gen Kaby Lake processor. You'll also need to watch using Microsoft's Edge browser. \nSuch restrictions may seem overly harsh, but it's not just Netflix that imposed them. The blame also lies with Hollywood. Netflix uses the 10-bit HEVC video compression standard, also known as H.265, and Hollywood insists on DRM wrapped around its content. \nH.265 is a successor to the widely used H.264 video compression standard. It offers double the data compression rate of H.264 while retaining the same video quality, or much higher quality video at the same compression. So you can see why Netflix embraced it. \nAny platform wishing to play H.265 content requires hardware decoding support. Intel's Kaby Lake processors are the first to offer full hardware acceleration support for encoding and decoding. Older processors can decode the streams, but in order to do so they use significantly higher CPU utilization and therefore power. Kaby Lake offers the required power efficiency missing from previous Intel chips as well as 10-bit HEVC support. // Related Articles Netflix Considers Offline Streaming \nThe Microsoft Edge requirement is due to the use of digital rights management (DRM) to protect the streams from being recorded and copied. Edge fully supports this protection. \nIntel's Kaby Lake processors are not widely available yet, making streaming Netflix at 4K on your Windows 10 PC a very niche appeal right now. There's also much easier ways to unlock 4K Netflix streaming using a dedicated streaming device . Your 4K TV may already support it, and if not, then devices including the Chromecast Ultra, Roku 4, and Xbox One S are among a growing list of devices that do. Netflix publishes a regularly updated list of supported hardware.",

      "text": "Barry Last month, Netflix released a dialogue-free teaser for its upcoming movie “Barry.” On Monday, The Huffington Post is debuting the first full-length trailer for the film.\nIn the newly released footage, you can see actor Devon Terrell’s take on Barack Obama , as the young Columbia University student overcomes several obstacles throughout his schooling, such as a racist security officer who insists on checking Obama’s identification. In another briefly shown scene, a man punches the future president in the face.\nDirector Vikram Gandhi ― perhaps most recognizable from his time as a correspondent and producer with “Vice” on HBO ― also attended Columbia and lived in a neighboring building to the one Obama once occupied. Apparently, legends of Obama’s Columbia escapades persisted until Gandhi’s time as a student.\nFellow Columbia alum Adam Mansbach, the author of Go the F**k to Sleep , wrote the “Barry” script, which follows Obama’s junior year at the school, beginning in 1981.\nWatch the trailer:\n“Barry” begins streaming on Netflix Dec. 16.\nAlso on HuffPost Thanks, Obama.

(Photo by Scott Roth/Invision/AP) Scott Roth Previous Next \nNEW YORK (AP) — Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years — a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. \nChappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\"''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "Since the show's original seven-season run popped up on Netflix in October 2014, it has attracted more soon-to-be-overly-caffeinated young women to its cause through a simple central premise involving a mother and daughter who are also best friends. Gilmore Girls debuted at the height of The WB alongside other iconic and influential pop culture programs that Lorelai (Lauren Graham) and Rory (Alexis Bledel) likely would have referenced (and probably have), including Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Dawson's Creek and Felicity. [...] by the time the show's then-series finale aired in May 2007, the so-called Golden Age of TV was already moving on to a darker, more complex era that would be dominated by the morally bankrupt stories of male antiheroes. [...] Netflix's four new episodes are coming at just the right time to act as a happy reprieve from the tumultuous political landscape of the real world that is currently filling the airwaves and the Internet with horrifying examples of hate and vitriol. The series has always been the singular vision of one wild and amazing woman, and when the Palladinos departed the series amid contract disputes following Season 6, that vision slowly faltered without the woman who created it and nurtured it into the pop culture obsession it eventually became. Stepping back onto the familiar streets of Stars Hollow, with its never-ending festivals, colorful townspeople and old-fashioned diners (with or without wi-fi), is a comforting reminder of a simpler and happier life. In the opening moments of \"Winter,\" the first chapter of this new era, Sherman-Palladino's voice and signature rapid-fire dialogue is back with renewed energy. In the interest of keeping this a spoiler-free review -- not just because our Netflix overlords demand it but because I don't dare take away an ounce of future joy from my fellow fans -- it's safe to say that Lorelai is still the same woman we all wished had been o",

      "text": "print \nBrad Barket /Invision/AP \nIt's no joke how much Dave Chappelle is reportedly making on his new comedy special deal with Netflix. \nAccording to The New York Post's Page Six column, the comedian is making a total of $60 million for delivering three comedy specials to the streaming company in 2017. \n\"Dave was offered $20 million a special,\" Page Six's anonymous source said. \"Netflix basically has a war chest for this kind of content. Whether it’s a loss or not, Dave Chappelle’s specials will get a lot of press and bring in new subscribers.\" \nAt $20 million per special, that would place Chappelle's deal on par with the reported $40 million deal Chris Rock secured with Netflix last month for two comedy specials. \nA Netflix representative told Business Insider it doesn't comment on the financial details of its deals. \nThe concert specials are Chappelle’s first in 12 years. Two of the specials have already been shot, but were never released. The third one will be produced specifically for Netflix. All three are set to release simultaneously in 2017. \nThe deal follows Chappelle's hosting debut November 12 on \"Saturday Night Live,\" which delivered the season's highest overnight ratings and the best 18-to-49 ratings for the show since 2013. \nChappelle made a huge name for himself while starring on \"Chappelle's Show,\" a racially charged sketch show that ran on Comedy Central from 2003 to 2006. Most recently, he's been trying out new material in an intimate venue tour .",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/The Defenders) Promo image of \"The Defenders\" \nFilming for Netflix's upcoming superhero mashup series \"The Defenders\" is currently well underway in New York City and the public, who are keen to find out what's at stake in the show, managed to get some snaps of the cast members. \nA recent photo shared over at Yahoo shows series stars Rosario Dawson and Mike Colter who seem to be in their characters as Claire Temple and Luke Cage, sharing a passionate kiss. \nThe image stirred some interest among the fans who initially thought that Luke will get romantically linked with Misty Knight (Simone Missick). In fact, earlier reports cited the two characters hanging out together. In his solo appearance in \"Luke Cage,\" the two were clearly seen to be attracted with each another. They even ended up sleeping together. \nBut this photo of Luke and Claire brings forth a solid statement saying that it is actually the nurse who the impenetrable superhero really cares about. Advertisement \nThis tandem apparently contradicts the storyline in the Marvel comics wherein Luke marries Jessica Jones (played by Krysten Ritter in \"Jessica Jones\"). But the small screen adaptation took the liberty of changing the plot by having Luke leave Hell's Kitchen for his place at Harlem. \nAccording to Digital Spy , \"The Defenders\" will be an 8-part miniseries featuring the four Marvel heroes: Jessica, Luke, Daredevil (in \"Daredevil\" played by Charlie Cox), and Iron Fist (in the upcoming \"Iron Fist\" played Finn Jones). \nJoining the quartet are the confirmed supporting characters, Karen Page (Deborah Ann Woll), Foggy Nelson (Elden Henson), Stick (Scott Glenn), Elektra (Elodie Yung), Jeri Hogarth (Carrie-Anne Moss), Malcolm Ducasse (Eka Darville), Colleen Wing (Jessica Henwick), and Trish Walker (Rachael Taylor) just to name a few. \nFans should be also be on the lookout for the character of Sigourney Weaver, who will be joining the MCU for the first time. She will, however, reportedly be taking the role of a villain. \n\"The Defenders\" will stream on Netflix in 2017.  ",

      "text": "by Paul Alcorn November 22, 2016 at 11:05 AM \nMicrosoft announced via its blog that Netflix will stream four new \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes (sigh) in 4K. The company further noted that you must use Windows 10, the Edge browser, and 7th Generation Kaby Lake processors, as well as a premium subscription to unlock the emotional rollercoaster. \nOf course, a desktop would have more than enough power to muscle its way through a 4K episode of \"Gilmore Girls,\" but due to the wonders of vendor lock-in and DRM, you will be able to view the content only on a Kaby-Lake powered machine. Apparently, Netflix has bandwidth concerns, because it has effectively limited the four new (and exciting!) \"Gilmore Girls\" 4K episodes to one recommended device. The Microsoft blog post links to Microsoft's list of Windows 10 machines, but only one on the list (the Lenovo Yoga 910) sports a Kaby Lake processor and 4K display. \nOf course, we expect the desktop Kaby Lake launch to start soon, but the 4K streaming begins November 25, so we will all miss the 4K \"Gilmore Girls\" launch. Microsoft did not specify an exact reason why Netflix is limiting the 4K stream to the Kaby Lake products, but it is likely due to hardware-based DRM features. Although GPUs could also support the DRM, it doesn't appear to be on the menu as of yet. \nNetflix also requires Windows 10 for 4K streaming; previous-generation operating systems will not work. It also requires the cringe-worthy Edge browser. Windows 10 isn't that onerous of a requirement, but the Edge browser accounts for only roughly 6% of the market (and declining). Therefore, even though it's by no means the most popular option, it is your only choice for 4K \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix did go out of its way to take a swipe at Chrome, which is the most popular browser in the world: \nWhen streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery*** – and you know one episode can be the difference between Chris and Lorelai casually dating and being a married couple. \nOf course, we wouldn't want to miss out on the current status of Chris and Lorelai's relationship, but the blog notes: \n***Battery life varies significantly with settings and other factors. \nIn other words, your mileage may vary, and the battery claims may not even be a true statement. Microsoft has made plenty of fast and loose claims about Edge lately. I installed Windows 10 on a new rig I built this weekend, and when I installed Chrome, Windows notified me with a pop up that Edge detects and blocks 21% more socially engineered malware (the new pop-up actually made the news, too). It also took four or five attempts before Windows 10 would accept Chrome as my default browser. I digress. \nSome of these moves aren't entirely unforeseen, as Microsoft also recently announced that it would not support Intel's Kaby Lake and AMD's Zen processors with pre-Windows 10 operating systems. We've reached out to both AMD and Intel on that topic to inquire why, and what features will not work on Windows 7 and 8. Both companies directed us to Microsoft, which refuses to comment beyond canned quotes that don't answer the questions. \nNow, if you want to stream 4K video from Netflix, you have to break out the Kaby Lake and Windows 10 combo with some Edge browser sprinkled on top. Netflix hasn't announced 4K streaming support for Zen, but it almost certainly will (it had better). Just don't hold your breath for it to work with older processors. \nIt makes one wonder if there aren't some hidden forces in the background pulling strings to ensure that the average consumer has a reason to upgrade their computers. No Windows 10 or Netflix 4K streaming for the CPU stragglers and no Netflix 4K for the Chrome lovers. \nMaybe we need to coin the term NetWintel (WintelFlix?).

      "title": "Netflix can now be streamed to PCs in 4K (just not your PC)",
      "text": "10 comments TechSpot \nFact – it’s finally possible to stream Netflix to your PC in 4K quality. Reality – your PC almost certainly isn't capable of doing so. Here’s why. \nUp to this point, the only way to stream Netflix in 4K quality was to either use a compatible Smart TV or a 4K streaming device like one of Roku’s new set-top boxes . That restriction has always been a bit of a bummer for viewers with high-end PCs technically capable of driving a 4K streaming experience. \nOne would think that now, with that restriction lifted, PC users would be jumping for joy. Nope, not even close. \nAs it turns out, there are some serious restrictions in place for prospective 4K PC streamers. For starters, you’ll need to be using Windows 10 and naturally, you’ll want a 4K-capable display. Furthermore, one can only watch Netflix in 4K using Microsoft’s Edge browser. \nThe real kicker, however, is that you must be running a seventh-generation Intel Kaby Lake processor to reap the 4K rewards. This means that even Microsoft’s brand new 27-inch Surface Studio all-in-one can’t view Netflix in 4K. There are only a handful of laptops and convertibles on the market using Kaby Lake processors; desktop parts won’t be here until sometime early next year. \nWho is to blame for this atrocity? Hollywood, of course. \nAs The Verge highlights , DRM requirements from Hollywood studios and TV networks are incredibly strict as they’re dead set on preventing users from capturing 4K streams and distributing them illegally on the web. Kaby Lake, as it so happens, is the only Intel processor family that supports 10-bit HEVC (a popular 4K video codec). \nThat said, your best bet today to watch Netflix in 4K is either through a Smart TV or dedicated streaming device.

      "title": "Matt Czuchry on His 'Gilmore Girls' Return, 'Good Wife' Finale | Hollywood Reporter",
      "text": "Gilmore Girls The actor reprises his role as Logan in the forthcoming Netflix revival. \nWhen Matt Czuchry signed on for The Good Wife pilot in 2009, his biggest TV role to date was his breakout role of Logan Huntzberger on Gilmore Girls . So it was a particularly strange turn of events that Czuchry's first post- Good Wife role would be… Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , Netflix's forthcoming four-part revival. \n\"The universe is a crazy thing,\" Czuchry tells The Hollywood Reporter. \"In terms of that timing of putting one character down and picking another up, it couldn't be more special. I love the character of Logan, I love the character of Cary so to bridge that gap between them both was incredibly unique and couldn’t have been more perfect timing.\" \nCzuchry reprises his role as Logan, Rory's college boyfriend, in the limited series, which hits Netflix on Friday. Like the long-lasting legacy of Gilmore Girls, The Good Wife has continued to endure despite going off the air in May after seven seasons. \nCzuchry's co-stars on the legal drama, Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo, will reprise their roles as Diane Lockhart and Lucca Quinn, respectively, for a spinoff titled The Good Fight . Like the flagship drama, The Good Fight hails from co-creators and showrunners Robert and Michelle King and will be produced by CBS Studios. Unlike The Good Wife, The Good Fight will air on CBS All Access with the exception of the first episode, which will premiere on CBS. \nIn addition to Baranski and Jumbo, Sarah Steele and Gary Cole will reprise their roles from the original series. However, it sounds unlikely Czuchry will follow suit. \"No, there hasn’t been any talks on either side about that,\" he says about a possible appearance. \nCary Agos might be a harder piece to fit back into the puzzle given how things ended for him. Having grown hardened and bitter from years of in-fighting at the firm, Cary quit Lockhart, Agos and Lee in the fourth-to-last episode. In the finale, he appeared in a brief scene with Alicia (Julianna Margulies) and Jason (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) which showed he had segued into teaching law rather than practicing it. \n\"I felt like the closure was actually the episode where he quit the firm and left,\" Czuchry says. \"So for me, that was his last episode.\" \nWhen asked about his thoughts on the finale, and particularly that now famous slap between Diane and Alicia, Czuchry is mum – but with good reason. \n\"I never saw the last episode,\" Czuchry says. \"Of course I read it, but that was an episode where it was all about, for me personally, being with the crew and the cast and saying goodbye. So I had watched all the episodes up until that point for research; that one I wanted to leave as just something special on set.\" \nIt sounds like Czuchry has no intention to change that anytime soon, saying \"I have no plans to watch it.\" \nIn contrast, it sounds like he will be tuning in for The Good Fight when it premieres in February. \"I've emailed with Christine and Cush and I'm excited for them,\" he says. \"They're both great so I'm excited for both of them and want to see what it's going to be like.\" \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.

No exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials \"come directly from Chappelle's personal comedy vault,\" Netflix said. Chappelle's comedy career includes movie roles in \"The Nutty Professor,\" ''Con Air\" and \"Blue Streak.\" In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, \"Chappelle's Show,\" until his abrupt exit in its third season. Earlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC's \"Saturday Night Live,\" mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. More Entertainment News ",

The hospitalization follows weeks of behavior that seemed erratic, even for the eccentric star; he recently stunned fans at a San Jose show by saying that he didn't vote but would have supported Donald Trump (despite at least appearing to back Hillary Clinton previously) and then, in Sacramento, lashing out at superstar colleagues Jay-Z and Beyonce and ending his concert after just three songs. His Saint Pablo tour was canceled Monday, owing to what reps called exhaustion. \nIt's been a rough few months for the family: West's wife, Kim Kardashian , is reportedly still reeling after being tied up at gunpoint and robbed in Paris in October. Just a month prior, his show at New York Fashion Week was deemed a disaster by the press. Representatives from Keeping Up have remained mum about whether the Paris incident, or the Fashion Week show, will be addressed on Keeping Up with the Kardashians.",

      "text": "Netflix brings 4K / Ultra HD streaming to Windows 10 but requires Edge and Kaby Lake Posted 22 November 2016 13:11   \nNetflix will make streaming of movies and series in Ultra HD / 4K available for Windows 10. However, users need a computer with the latest generation Intel CPU, a 4K display and are limited to the Edge browser to view the content. \nIt’s for the first time 4K content is available on computers. Previously it was only possible to view content in such a high resolution on some TVs, set top boxes or consoles. \nIn order to view the content on the PC, users need a Netflix Premium subscription (which is the only plan with Ultra HD support), a computer with a Kaby Lake generation CPU and a 4K display. Besides that, they also need to use Microsoft’s Edge browser, as it’s the only browser that (currently?) supports Netflix 4K content. \nWhy Netflix streaming in 4K on the PC requires Edge is unclear, but Microsoft uses the opportunity to underline again how Edge has a better battery life than Chrome as it states, “When streaming Netflix on Microsoft Edge you can get through at least one more full episode of Gilmore Girls than when streaming on Chrome on battery”, which the company previously also claimed in popups shown to Chrome users in Windows 10 and which refer to t ests performed by the company. \nMicrosoft adds however that “Battery life varies significantly with settings and other factors”. \nThe requirement of Intel’s Kaby Lake generation CPU is likely because the CPU has better DRM features than its predecessors.",

Stating that even if Netflix takes a loss on deals like this, which it is almost certain to, the financial windfall they see from new subscribers because of exclusive stand-up specials and the press they get surrounding unique content like this more than makes up for the loss Netflix might take on an individual deal.\nRELATED: The Netflix Adds And Drops For The Month Of December 2016 Are Absolutely ‘Marvelous’ The good news for Dave Chappelle fans is typically these large stand-up specials are accompanied by world tours where the comedians perfect their stage acts before the big night. So if I was a betting man I’d wager that we see multiple Dave Chappelle comedy tours announced over the next year or so.\n[h/t PageSix ] \n\n",

      "text": "By Anna Ben Yehuda Posted: Monday November 21 2016, 2:54pm A photo posted by Saturday Night Live - SNL (@nbcsnl) on Nov 13, 2016 at 9:21am PST \nFollowing the much-chronicled and appreciated monologue he delivered while hosting Saturday Night Live last week, Dave Chappelle makes headlines again as Netflix announces the upcoming release of three new comedy specials starring the comedian. \nSharing the news on Twitter , the network disclosed that one special will be an original set filmed exclusively for Netflix and the other two have been taped at Austin City Limits Live and the Hollywood Palladium. While the latter two productions will be released in 2017, the original special has yet to receive an official premiere date. \n“Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy—searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,” said Lisa Nishimura, Netflix’s vice president of original documentary and comedy, in a statement. “Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nChappelle's first TV specials in 12 years, the programs follow Netflix's recent announcement regarding the release of two new comedy segments from Chris Rock (for which he will reportedly be paid a total of $40 million) and the airing of other comedy specials starring Aziz Ansari and Patton Oswalt.

      "text": "0 comments \nWhile Amazon, Netflix and Hulu are slowly adding new genre titles to their streaming services, Starz keeps dropping bombs. \nThis continues this coming December with a rash of new horror films being added, not to mention you get to watch all of Sam Raimi’s “Ash vs Evil Dead”, which isn’t a bad added bonus. \nOn December 1st they’ll be adding a quartet of Child’s Play films to go along with Tom Holland’s masterpiece that’s already on the app. Now you’ll be able to catch Child’s Play 2 (1990), Child’s Play 3 (1991), Bride of Chucky (1998), and even Seed of Chucky (2004), although Seed of Chucky will not be included. \nOn the same date they’ll be adding Joe Dante’s hilarious 1989 The ‘Burbs in which Tom Hanks plays an overstressed suburbanite who struggles to prove his paranoid theory that the new family on the block are part of a murderous cult. When was the last time you saw David Cronenberg’s The Dead Zone (1983) in which Cristopher Walken stars as a man awakens from a coma to discover he has a psychic detective ability? That’s joining Tobe Hooper’s The Funhouse (1981) as well as The Grudge (2004) remake and it’s sequel The Grudge 2 (2006). \nOn December 2nd Starz will add Clive Barker’s criminally underrated Lord of Illusions (1995), which stars Scott Bakula as a NY private investigator who stumbles onto members of a fanatic cult, who are waiting for the resurrection of their leader Nix. \nLastly, December 9th adds The Remains (2015) and the awesome The X-Files (1998) movie, which ties directly into an arc of the “X-Files” television series. \nNot too shabby. For everything else, see below. \nAVAILABLE DECEMBER 1 st",

      "text": "A video posted by Donald Cerrone (@cowboycerrone) on Nov 21, 2016 at 11:18am PST \nDon’t worry … don’t worry … Donald Cerrone wants to be the first to assure you that his fight against Matt Brown at UFC 206 is still happening, despite what you’d want to believe from the look of his face in his latest Instagram video. \nCerrone doesn’t have a reputation as a boy who cried wolf. The action-lover has had all kinds of bumps and bruises through the years from waterskiing or wakeboarding or rock climbing or off-roading. He powers through them and is known as one of the most active fighters in UFC history. \nSo when “Cowboy” posted a video to his Instagram feed on Monday showing a fully mangled right side of his face and head with his right eye sealed shut, it wasn’t that big of a stretch for some to wonder just what Cerrone had gotten into this time that has caused what looked to be a pretty horrific injury. \n“What’s going on, everybody? It’s ‘Cowboy.’ Before the media puts out what happened, just to let you all know I’m still fighting in Toronto Dec. 10. I’m still fighting – everything’s good. After hours on the table, the doctors were able to save my eye – no issues there, so a couple weeks, let it heal up, and see y’all in Toronto. (Expletive) – can’t catch a break on this fight.” \nWith Cerrone’s fight at UFC 206 in Toronto less than three weeks away, it wouldn’t be a stretch to assume that if he indeed had suffered an injury involving his eye, plus full cuts all over his face, he would not be getting cleared to fight any time soon. \nBut what we do know is that Cerrone earlier this year was cast in the Netflix-produced upcoming series “Godless,” which is scheduled for a 2017 debut on the platform. According to the Internet Movie Database’s entry for “Godless,” Cerrone will appear in six episodes – as will his longtime Jackson-Winkeljohn MMA teammate Keith Jardine, who long has been an actor on the big and small screen. \nThe series, according to IMDB, is summed up like this: “Frank Griffin, an outlaw terrorizing the 1880s American West, hunts down Roy Goode, his partner turned enemy. Roy hides out at a ranch as Frank’s chase leads him to La Belle, New Mexico – a town mysteriously made up entirely of women.” \nThe show’s production team includes Steven Soderbergh as one of the creators and executive producers. Soderbergh is a three-time Oscar nominee and won in 2001 for Best Director for “Traffic.” His directing credits included the “Ocean’s” franchise, “Out of Sight” and “Erin Brockovich, \nIn August, Cerrone told “ The Joe Rogan Podcast ” he had been cast for six episodes in the mini-series, which is set in the American West in 1884. \nCerrone was supposed to fight Kelvin Gastelum at UFC 205 earlier this month. But Gastelum failed to make weight – by not even showing up for the official weigh-ins – and the fight was scrapped. Cerrone (31-7 MMA, 18-4 UFC) quickly was rebooked against Brown (20-15 MMA, 13-10 UFC) at UFC 206, which takes place Dec. 10 at Air Canada Centre in Toronto with a main card on pay-per-view following prelims on FS1 and UFC Fight Pass. \nFor more on UFC 206 , check out the MMA Rumors section of the site.",

Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,” ‘‘Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. Performing at the Essence Festival in New Orleans. July 6, 2014 | \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics. --Associated Press",

      "text": "Netflix 4K coming to a select few PCs by  12:00 PM on November 22, 2016 \nMicrosoft has announced that Netflix 4K support is coming to a small number of Windows PCs over on its Windows Blog . Owners of 4K TVs and high-end HTPCs shouldn't get too excited, since this support has some meaningful restrictions. \nFirst, Netflix 4K streaming is supported only on seventh-generation Intel CPUs, more commonly known as Kaby Lake. These chips pack hardware support for the 10-bit HEVC encoding scheme Netflix uses for 4K content, unlike past iGPUs. \nSecond, high-resolution Netflix will require playback through Microsoft's Edge browser running on the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, something that could limit market appeal, to say the least. The popular Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers do not support Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM scheme at this time. \nAccording to Ars Technica , Nvidia Pascal GPUs have support for Microsoft's PlayReady 3.0 DRM and have 10-bit HEVC hardware acceleration, but are still not on the support list for Netflix 4K streaming. So far, Kaby Lake chips are only offered in recent laptop releases. Apple's recently updated MacBook Pro laptop line does not include Kaby Lake CPUs, so those running Windows on Apple hardware will apparently have to wait until the next hardware refresh. Desktop Kaby Lake CPUs are expected to arrive in early 2017. \nFor now, despite the existence of 4K Netflix support on the PC platform, most PC owners will still have to view 4K Netflix content using set-top boxes like Amazon's Fire TV , Roku Premiere , or the Nvidia Shield .",

      "text": "  09:15 AM PST by Steven Cohen \nCompatible Windows 10 PCs and 2-in-1 devices can now play Netflix 4K streaming content. \nMicrosoft has announced the arrival of 4K Ultra HD Netflix streaming on supported Windows 10 computers and devices. Netflix offers a variety of 4K movies and TV shows, including its upcoming original series 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.' The new four-part event will start streaming in Ultra HD on November 25. \nIn order to watch Netflix 4K streaming on Windows 10, users will need a 4K display, and a PC or device using a 7th Gen Intel Core processor, which provides the necessary Ultra HD DRM security tools integrated into the hardware. This includes the recent Lenovo Yoga 910 2-in-1, the HP Pavilion Wave, the HP OMEN Desktop, the MSI Vortex G65, the Dell Alienware Aurora R5, and more. For a full list of supported Windows 10 products, click here . In addition to a 7th Gen Intel Core processor, customers will also need to use Microsoft Edge, the only browser that currently supports Netflix 4K streaming. Likewise, according to Microsoft, the Edge browser is also capable of longer streaming playback on battery compared to the Google Chrome browser. \nA current Netflix subscription starts at $10 for HD streaming and $12 for Ultra HD streaming. Other upcoming Netflix premieres include ' 3% ' on November 25, ' Fuller House ' season two on December 9, ' Barry ' on December 16, ' A Series of Unfortunate Events ' on January 13, ' David Brent: Life on the Road ' on February 10, and ' Iron Fist ' on March 17. Beyond Netflix, Sony also recently announced support for its ULTRA 4K streaming service through computers using 7th Gen Intel Core processors beginning Q1 2017.",

      "text": "Teo Bugbee 26m ago \nAfter a decade-long hiatus, the highly anticipated Netflix revival Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life opens with mother-and-daughter team Lorelai and Rory Gilmore meeting at the Stars Hollow gazebo to share food and conversation. It all seems so familiar that it’s too familiar, and the torrent of references jumping from scabies to Les Misérables to Goop to Yonah Schimmel finally culminates in a breathlessly self-conscious gasp from Rory, from actress Alexis Bledel, and presumably from the entire cast and crew of the new season of Gilmore Girls : “Oh wow, winded.” Lorelai (Lauren Graham) doesn’t quite wink in response, but the show can’t resist one more acknowledgment of its own return: “Haven’t done that for a while.” Welcome back to Stars Hollow, and welcome to the new world of revival TV. \nGilmore Girls isn’t the first beloved television series to be revived by the streaming wars based on the strength of a rabid fan base, but Gilmore Girls is different from The X-Files or even Full House in that the original series was a serial drama that documented little more than time passing in the lives of its cast of small-town characters. The first season of Gilmore Girls premiered at the dawn of the new golden age of television — just one year after The Sopranos and two after Sex and the City —and however simple the results, the Gilmore Girls formula has proven resistant to imitation or franchise. \nGilmore Girls showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino is rarely mentioned alongside the giants of modern television — the Chases, the Milches, the Weiners, the Gilligans, the Sorkins — but her show was the chatty Austen to prestige television’s plotty Dickens, as singular an artistic vision of what television could accomplish as any of its masculine counterparts. Gilmore Girls was an hour-long domestic drama that often played like a comedy, an evening aperitif lacking foundation in genre that also didn’t bother much with the heaviness of a cause-and-effect narrative. The lives of Emily, Lorelai, and Rory Gilmore were undramatic, unbothered by the usual constraints of hero’s journeys or season-long character arcs, and despite the show’s famously dense dialogue, the pace of the series mimicked the pace of real life. Underlying resentments might bubble under the surface for two or three seasons before anyone thought to say anything, years might pass before characters who were meant to be together got together, and the larger contexts of class and gender that underpin the Gilmores’ behavior were sometimes discussed but never altered. Meanwhile, episodes themselves would float by in a cloud of banter, the characters communicating more about their favorite ’80s girl groups than they did about their hopes, their fears, their dreams, their lives. \nFor people who never watched Gilmore Girls , the devotion it inspires from its audience can be baffling — is this not a cult of white women who just love to hear themselves talk? But for fans of the series, its combination of conversational creativity and slow dramatic turnover makes the show feel like a benevolent extension of the world we already inhabit. If series like The Sopranos invested the structure of soap operas with thematic heft and complexity, Gilmore Girls hewed closer to that other marvel of small-town oddities, Twin Peaks , in its devotion to tone, rhythm, and mood. And like Twin Peaks, Gilmore Girls ceased to function once it started to behave as a more recognizable soap. Despite Sherman-Palladino’s public ousting by the then-nascent CW network, the derided final season of Gilmore Girls was just as full of banter and quirky bit players as its beloved early seasons. Instead, the mistake was in treating Gilmore Girls as a soap built to accommodate long-lost love children or surprise marriages. The resentment over those misguided final episodes has lasted with the series even as new fans came to the show through streaming or over the course of its successful period of syndication with ABC Family. So with the new season offered by Netflix, showrunner Amy Sherman-Palladino has been given the opportunity to return to her show on her own terms, and in watching, fans of the Gilmores are gifted one last chitchat. \nBut even for the most optimistic fan of the original series, it would be hard not to worry that the platonic dream of a return will be failed by the constrictions of reality. Those looking homeward after time has passed often find that you can’t go home again ... so what happens when you try to go to Stars Hollow after nearly a decade’s absence? In truth, there is a kind of uncanny pall cast over Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life — like in a zombie movie, the spirit of the dead can’t quite return to the body without leaving something behind in the transition. For as much as Gilmore Girls was known for its dialogue, the visual language of the original series is thrown into sharp focus with the repeated shocks of watching new angles on familiar sets, new cutting patterns for familiar conversations, and new (older) faces on familiar characters. The visual style of the original series is self-consciously mimicked by a new crew with new lighting setups and new digital cameras. The colors seem off — was the original show really sepia-toned, or is it just the way my memory has preserved it? \nTo its credit, however, if the series isn’t quite the same as it was before, Sherman-Palladino’s writing at least acknowledges the gap. In some ways, the focus Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life puts on time is a narrative necessity born from the death of Edward Herrmann, the actor known for playing Richard Gilmore — the show’s closest reminder of a patriarch. But even beyond the death of a beloved co-star, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life remains persistently aware of the underlying question of mortality presented by its return from the dead. Sherman-Palladino wisely centers both beginnings and endings in the new series, and the strongest material comes from its direct attempts to grapple with what is lost and what is gained with the passage of time. Each episode of the show is devoted to a new season — “Winter,” “Spring,” “Summer,” “Fall” — and if the four 90-minute installments threaten to burn by with the adrenaline of a defibrillator charge, there are enough moments of quiet troubadour strumming to remind you of the calm that the original series had to offer. If it’s not really possible to recreate an experience once the moment has passed, there’s at least comfort in knowing that someone else saw what you did the first time and loved it enough to try to preserve it.

      "text": "Netflix's 'Barry,' About Young Barack Obama, Gets First Trailer! \nNetflix has released the first full trailer for the upcoming movie Barry , which gives a look at the life of a young Barack Obama years before he became president. \nNewcomer Devon Terrell stars in the film as the title character alongside Anya Taylor-Joy , who plays an amalgamation of his three, white college girlfriends. \nThe movie will start streaming on December 16! \nHere is the synopsis: A young Barack Obama , known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. Barry l Official Trailer [HD] l Netflix ",

      "text": "single Share this article \nEver since Netflix announced the return of Gilmore Girls this Friday, one question has been on everyone’s minds: Who will Rory end up with? Which team will win? Will it be Dean, Jess, or Logan? \nTeam Dean \nRory bumps into Dean during the pilot of the series. She drops her school books and gets annoyed at the towering figure in front of her, until she sees his face. Dean moved to town from Chicago, and was intrigued by Rory from the beginning. Rory can’t stop thinking about him, and Dean can’t stop himself from casually bumping into Rory. \nPros: He’s adorable. Dean is clearly the boy-next-door type. In their first encounter in the hallway, Dean picked up on Rory’s movie references right away. Why is this a plus? Because, Rory and Lorelei spend most of their days doing just that. He’s on good terms with the people in Rory’s life, which is great in a relationship. He’s undeniably in love with her, and would have done anything for her. He even built a car for her. In all, he’s caring, sweet, and in love with Rory. \nCons: While Dean was a great first boyfriend for Rory, there isn’t much on Dean in the series. Who is he? He became jealous and possessive when Jess came into the picture and quickly hated him. He didn’t even want to try to tolerate him for Rory’s sake. Jess wasn’t the only guy he didn’t like, there was also Tristan before him. After Rory, Dean jumped into a loveless marriage straight out of high school, while he still had feelings for her. He then went on to pursue Rory and sleep with her, while still married. \nIn his defense: Sure, he got a little jealous when Jess came into the picture, but who wouldn’t when seeing their significant other falling for someone else? Many disapprove of Dean because of his poor judgement while being married, but he was young, dumb, and in love. We all make mistakes, and that was Dean’s. His mistake doesn’t make him a bad person. \nTeam Jess \nJess is Luke’s nephew who is forced in a small town he doesn’t like. Jess is introduced to Rory in season two’s episode “Nick & Nora/Sid & Nancy” when Luke and him are invited to dinner at Lorelei’s. Jess looked uninterested by the dinner, and wandered into Rory’s room. \nPros: Jess is the brooding, bad boy type that makes girls swoon. He’s intellectual and shares Rory’s love of books. He shows her another side of life that she wouldn’t have seen otherwise. When Rory sees Jess again later in the series, he proved to have matured in many ways. The Jess who ran off to California isn’t the same Jess who puts Rory in her place when she dropped out of Yale and let Logan be a drunk jerk in the episode \"Let Me Hear Your Balalaikas Ringing Out.\" In all, Jess shows a lot of potential. \nCons: He doesn’t try. Jess comes off as uncaring. He’s the bad boy type after all. Jess messing with Dean is a low move. He purposefully put him down and got between Dean and Rory. When Rory asked him to try to get along with her mother, he was never interested. Jess also doesn’t say what he feels, which leaves Rory in the dark. He ran off to California without telling her about it, without even saying goodbye. To top it off, he comes back a year after leaving, declares his love for Rory and then walks away. Later in season four, he arrives at Rory’s dorm to tell her he wants to be with her, but “not here” where her home and school is, where she wants to stay. \nIn his defense : Like Dean, Jess was a dumb teenager. He was angry at his situation, and he was in a place he didn’t want to be. Having a bad past with authority figures, he was on guard with everyone and constantly had a wall up. He did grow up though and showed a lot of improvement throughout the series. \nTeam Logan \nRory has the pleasure of meeting Logan during her time at Yale in the episode “Written in the Stars” in season five. Logan comes off as a snob and Rory dislikes him right away. Especially since the next day he runs into her again, flirts with her, and doesn’t remember their meeting nor her name. \nPros: He’s a good balance between Dean and Jess; he’s caring like Dean, but has a more adventurous side like Jess. He’s the “live in the moment” type of guy. He doesn’t give up on his relationship with Rory, and when they’re in trouble he fights for them. He tries to get on Lorelei’s good side because he knows that’s important to Rory. When Rory dropped out of Yale and stopped talking to her mother, he encouraged her to reach out to Lorelei. He supported Rory when she felt unsure, and he understood when she was upset about her parents’ marriage. Logan was both loving and caring. \nCons: He had a rocky start by coming off as the stereotypical spoiled rich boy, but he grew up a lot during the last two seasons. Rory was Logan’s first serious girlfriend, and it took him a while to adjust to his new life of no longer being a bachelor. He slept with his sister’s bridesmaids while thinking Rory and him are on a break. Though he promised to plan his future around Rory’s plans, he ended up giving her an ultimatum when she refused his proposal. It was all, or nothing. That was unfair and selfish of him to force Rory into that decision after promising her something else. \nIn his defense: In Ross Geller’s words: THEY WERE ON A BREAK. \n\nIn the end, does Rory have to choose among her exes? Rory is an independent woman who values her family, maintains a beautiful friendship with her mother and is passionate about her career goals. She is capable of going far on her own. Rory was never really single, after Dean there was Jess, and then back to Dean and soon after there was Logan. Who knows what happened after refusing Logan’s proposal, maybe it was her chance to discover herself. \nSo the question remains, who will Rory choose? All three brought something she needed in her life at that moment, but all three had their own flaws. Will Rory pick one of her ex-boyfriends? Or will she go for team Rory? You Might Also Enjoy",

      "text": "Karen Fratti @karenfratti | 11.22.16 | 1:28   CREDIT: Fred Watkins/Getty Images \nO h, thank the sweet Netflix gods for something smart to watch as the country basically gets flushed down the toilet by the Trump administration. On Monday, Netflix announced three new Dave Chappelle stand-up specials , which means there will be a voice of reason to help everyone cope as chaos ensues. Chappelle hosted Saturday Night Live the weekend after the election, and it was a much needed reminder that we need people like Chappelle who aren’t afraid to mince words or talk about the things that make us a little uncomfortable, right now at this very moment. \nSure, he ended his monologue by saying he could give the incoming president “a chance,” which was a little disappointing, but since we know Trump is going to fail everyone in the next four years, at least Chappelle will have a platform to call him out and make us laugh through the tears. \nOr maybe not. There are no release dates yet for the specials , but the streaming network did confirm that one of the three will be filmed exclusively for Netflix (read: new). The other two were previously filmed at Austin City Limits and the Hollywood Paladium and are coming from Chappelle’s “personal comedy vault.” \nThey’ll be the first taped specials since Dave Chappelle: For What It’s Worth came out in 2004. Jesus, if that doesn’t make you feel old AF, I don’t know what will. New or not, it will be nice to have Chappelle back in our living rooms. And it also proves that Netflix really does know what’s good for us. Lisa Nishimura, the VP of original docs and comedy for Netflix, told Variety , “ Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy — searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential. Dave’s three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy.” \nRemember, this is the guy that gave us “The Racial Draft” back in 2004. If there was a ever a time for him to make a comeback, it’s this very moment. In addition to signing on with Chappelle, Netflix also signed a deal with Chris Rock for $40 million last month to make two stand-up specials for 2017. It’s not like Netflix means to do a public service — signing on big names for exclusive specials is a strategic move for the company — but if that means giving space to voices like Chappelle and Rock, it can do whatever the hell it wants.",

      "text": "4K Netflix is finally available on PC but only for Kaby Lake November 22nd, 2016 at 5:58 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nNetflix has been streaming Ultra-HD/4K content since way back in 2013 but over the years, this higher quality level has been limited to newer Smart TVs and some other specific devices, like the Nvidia Shield TV and now PS4 Pro/Xbox One S. It has been a long time coming but Ultra-HD Netflix streaming is now finally available on PC through Windows 10. Unfortunately, this announcement has been hampered down by some crazy system requirement limitations. \nWindows 10 users can now stream 4K content- but you will need a 7th generation Intel Kaby Lake processor. This is a problem because Kaby Lake is currently only available in a select number of laptops and won’t even be available to desktop users until early 2017, on top of that, older processors should also be perfectly capable of smooth UHD playback. \nThe reasoning behind the Kaby Lake limitation hasn’t really been explained in an official capacity but chances are it has something to do with copyright protection. The Kaby Lake chipset supports the HDCP 2.2 protocol, which helps protect against the copying of 4K content. \nIf you want to stream 4K Netflix, aside from needing the display and Kaby Lake CPU, you will also want Microsoft’s Edge browser, as it is the only one capable of going beyond 1080p. \nKitGuru Says: I have owned a 4K monitor for several years now, I have been waiting for Netflix to support the higher resolution on PC for a long time. Unfortunately, with these limitations in place, most people won’t be able to experience it without a hardware upgrade, which is a real shame.",

      "text": "Saeed Adyani/Netflix November 22, 2016 | 11:54AM PT \nGilmore Girls” is returning to TV via Netflix on Nov. 25, with four new 90-minute episodes titled “ Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .” Variety spoke with the cast about their favorite “Gilmore” memories and what we can expect from the new episodes. \nThe passing of Edward Herrmann, who played Gilmore family patriarch Richard, at the end of 2014 was a massive blow to the “Gilmore Girls” cast and crew, who had played his family for eight years. Rather than turn Richard into an off-screen presence for the new episodes, having him off on a long business or golfing trip, “Gilmore Girls” creator Amy Sherman-Palladino decided art would imitate life, and Richard, too, would pass away. And so when we rejoin Gilmore matriarch Emily, played by Kelly Bishop , at the start of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,” she’s still trying to cope with the loss of her husband. \nFor Bishop, coming back to the show was a way to channel her own grief. “With Emily, it’s not only the sadness of grieving, but the rage of grieving, and trying to figure it out, and then actually evolving,” she tells Variety . Related Lauren Graham & Alexis Bledel on Why ‘Gilmore Girls’ is Returning: ‘The Whole Thing Was Unfinished!’ \n“Gilmore” was Bishop and Herrmann’s first time working together, and like Bishop’s experience meeting stars Lauren Graham, who plays daughter Lorelai, and Alexis Bledel, who plays granddaughter Rory, she knew it would work. \nBishop and Herrmann had actually met before, at the 1976 Tonys. Bishop had won for featured actress in a musical (“A Chorus Line”), Herrmann for featured actor in a play (“Mrs. Warren’s Profession”). They briefly exchanged hellos and congratulations before posing for a photo with the other recipients of acting awards. But both had forgotten the moment, despite Bishop having kept a newspaper clipping with the picture. \n“Ed and I were standing right together, and we didn’t know each other at all,” Bishop recalls. \nThey met again nearly a quarter of a century later to take another photo, the one that would be blown up and placed prominently on the set of the Gilmore manse: “I thought, ‘My, my, things do come around, don’t they?’” \nBut for all the grief of her character’s arc in these four episodes, what Bishop loves most about the series is the blend of emotion and humor. “It’s funny, but not in a ‘pause for laughs,’ sitcom way,” she says. “The smarter you are, the more you get out of it. But when all is said and done, there’s a true goodness to the show, a real kindness to it.” \nAnd in a world consumed by divisiveness and turmoil, Bishop is looking forward to sitting down and seeing the four episodes set in a comforting world, just like the legions of fans patiently waiting for 3 a.m. ET on Nov. 25. “Nothing bad really happens in Stars Hollow,” she says. “People have conflicts and little problems, but they work it out. That’s where everyone’s going to want to head.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle to unleash 3 Netflix comedy specials in 2017 Dave Chappelle \nNEW YORK (AP) – Comedian Dave Chappelle is headed back to TV with his first concert specials in a dozen years _ a trio of specials to be released on Netflix simultaneously in 2017. \nNo exact date was given by Netflix, which said one of the specials is being produced exclusively for the network. Two additional never-before-seen specials “come directly from Chappelle’s personal comedy vault,” Netflix said. \nChappelle’s comedy career includes movie roles in “The Nutty Professor,” `’Con Air” and “Blue Streak.” In 2003, he achieved heightened fame and critical acclaim as mastermind of his Comedy Central sketch series, “Chappelle’s Show,” until his abrupt exit in its third season. \nEarlier this month, he made his hosting debut on NBC’s “Saturday Night Live,” mixing one-liners with serious jabs at race relations and politics.

      "text": "In an unfortunate event in 2015, a supposedly fake teaser for Netflix ’s new “Lemony Snicket” series went viral. Well, your fortunes have changed.\nThe Baudelaire children are back in the new, official, real trailer for “ Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events .” Count Olaf, played by Neil Patrick Harris, is back, too, and he’s more slimy than ever. (Olaf is the conniving troublemaker after the Baudelaires’ inheritance.)\nBased on the video, the eight-episode series looks to capture the same beats from the books and the 2004 Jim Carrey movie. Despite that, or possibly because of it, Netflix posted the trailer with a message warning viewers not to watch when the series drops on Friday, Jan. 13:\nDear Viewer,\nThe world is vast and full of wonders. So on Friday, the 13th of January, please ... watch something else.\nAfter all the anticipation, if fans do refrain from viewing, that’d be truly unfortunate.\nAlso on HuffPost 12 Highest-Rated Movies on Netflix 12 Highest-Rated Movies on Netflix 1 of 12 \"Reservoir Dogs\" (1992) (IMDB: 8.4) A bunch of dudes are super terrible at stealing diamonds.

      "text": "\nParker Posey Joins Netflix’s Lost in Space as Dr. Smith Deadline is reporting that Cafe Society and Mascots star Parker Posey has signed on to co-star in the Netflix reboot of Lost in Space . She will portray the iconic schemer Dr. Smith, as played by Jonathan Harris in the original series and Gary Oldman in the 1998 feature film.\nShe joins a cast that includes Molly Parker ( House of Cards ) as Maureen Robinson; Toby Stephens ( Black Sail s) as her husband, astrophysicist/expedition commander John Robinson; Maxwell Jenkins ( Sense8 ) as her son, Will Robinson; and Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as her daughter, Judy Robinson.\nThe new Lost in Space series is being reimagined by the feature writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold , Last Witch Hunter ), with Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) showrunning. The plan is for the new Lost in Space to take its cues from the original series. As such, it will center around the Robinson family, who are forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, the new Lost in Space is officially described as being “a survival story for the ages.”\nCreated by Irwin Allen, the original Lost in Space premiered on CBS in 1965 and went on to last for three seasons and 85 episodes. The series focused on the intergalactic adventures of The Robinson family, who were originally sent into the stars aboard the Jupiter 2 for colonization, but the vessel was sabotaged by the backstabbing Dr. Zachary Smith, whose efforts to disrupt the trip resulted in the clan being stranded in the cosmos.\nZack Estrin serves as executive producer on the new Lost in Space alongside Sazama and Sharpless as well as Synthesis Entertainment’s Kevin Burns ( The Curse of Oak Island , Ancient Aliens ) and Jon Jashni ( Godzilla , Pacific Rim ) and Applebox’s Emmy -nominated director Neil Marshall ( Game of Thrones , The Descent ) and Marc Helwig. Marshall is also set to direct several episodes of the series.\nThe 10-episode first season is set to air in 2018.\n(Photo Credit: WENN.com)\nThe post Parker Posey Joins Netflix’s Lost in Space as Dr. Smith appeared first on ComingSoon.net .",

      "title": "Netflix Drops Full Trailer For Young Barack Obama Biopic ‘Barry’",
      "text": "Subscribe to D'MARGE TV \nBefore he was Mr. President, he was a Columbia University student searching for hope. In the first full-length trailer for Barry , Netflix’s young Barack Obama biopic, we peek at the future 44th President of the United States as he forms his views on race, government, and what it means to be American. \nThe film couldn’t be more timely. As Obama prepares to hand over the White House keys to his successor, waves of sentimental nostalgia for his presidency have already spread around the world. It’s now time to cement his legacy, and films like Barry will shape the narrative we tell. \nAustralian newcomer Devon Terrell has the daunting honour of stepping into Obama’s shoes, portraying him as a 20-year-old undergraduate grappling with his identity and indulging in the classic college pastimes of drinking, smoking, and dancing. It’s not just Terrell’s first feature film credit – it’s his first acting credit ever . \nThe Sydney Morning Herald praised his performance, saying he “inhabits the character with an enthralling, quiet complexity, fleshing out in nuanced but forensic detail an Obama who fitted in nowhere and everywhere, and was powered by a singular sense of drive and integrity amid his identity struggles.” The film also garnered positive reviews when it debuted at this year’s Toronto International Film Festival. \nFilmmaker Vikram Gandhi ( Kumaré , HBO’s “Vice”), a Columbia University alumni, was inspired to write and direct this feature in collaboration with fellow alum Adam Mansbach (author of “Go the F**k to Sleep”). The official synopsis reads: \n“A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as ‘Barry,’ arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates. Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later.” \nThe film will begin streaming on Netflix on December 16.",

Or does the new HDCP 2.2 allow for the iGPU on Kaby Lake to handle the Decode, then send that to your GPU of choice (Nvidia or ATI/AMD/Radeon) and output over their HDMI? I have a feeling this whole 4k on Kaby only with Windows is going to also require using the iGPU motherboard HDMI output as well, even though it's not required for 4k content itself, but instead this will be their way of controlling HDCP to \"try\" to prevent ripping of content. But with \"full screen recording\" software, it's not actually going to stop anything... As long as you allow content on a computer, there will always be ways to capture video and audio... The way I see it is that you also need a Monitor with HDMI HDCP 2.2. I do not think DP has HDCP 2.2. So you need a new CPU, pay more for Netflix, New Monitor for some stupid shows.",

      "text": "WATCH: Netflix Releases ‘Barry’ Trailer – We’re Gonna Miss Him When He’s Gone By Natalie Dailey on November 22, 2016 Subscribe \nNetflix made a biopic movie about President Barack Obama. Those of you who have Netflix will be able to watch it on December 16. Since Donald Trump is going to be president in less than two months, we seem to be getting nostalgic about President Obama. \nThe movie , Barry , focuses on his time at Columbia University in the 1980s. Newcomer Australian actor Devon Terrell will be playing the man himself. \nThe President was born in 1961 in Honolulu, Hawaii to a white mother and a black father. He went to Occidental College in Los Angeles, then he transferred to Columbia in 1981. This is where the film takes place. \nNetflix said this about it: “[Barry explores] a pivotal year in the life of the future 44th President of the United States, during which he developed the foundations for his views on race, government, and what it means to be American.” \nNetflix paid a whopping $4.5 million for the rights to the movie at the Toronto International Film Festival back in September. \nThis is the film’s official synopsis : “A young Barack Obama, known to his friends as “Barry,” arrives in New York City in the fall of 1981 to begin his junior year at Columbia University. In a crime-ridden and racially charged environment, Barry finds himself pulled between various social spheres and struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates.Barry is the story of a young man grappling with those same issues that his country, and arguably the world, are still coming to terms with 35 years later. Only on Netflix December 16.” \nI will definitely be watching this one. Those of us who love Obama and his policies will be sad to see him go in January. He has been a very classy, dignified president. Getting a glimpse into his past may be quite illuminating. \nWatch the official Barry trailer here : \nFeatured image via YouTube screenshot .

      "text": "SHARE Parker Posey Joins Netflix’s Lost in Space as Dr. Smith \nDeadline is reporting that Cafe Society and Mascots star Parker Posey has signed on to co-star in the Netflix reboot of Lost in Space . She will portray the iconic schemer Dr. Smith, as played by Jonathan Harris in the original series and Gary Oldman in the 1998 feature film. \nShe joins a cast that includes Molly Parker ( House of Cards ) as Maureen Robinson; Toby Stephens ( Black Sail s) as her husband, astrophysicist/expedition commander John Robinson; Maxwell Jenkins ( Sense8 ) as her son, Will Robinson; and Taylor Russell ( Falling Skies ) as her daughter, Judy Robinson. \nThe new Lost in Space series is being reimagined by the feature writing team of Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless ( Dracula Untold , Last Witch Hunter ), with Zack Estrin ( Prison Break ) showrunning. The plan is for the new Lost in Space to take its cues from the original series. As such, it will center around the Robinson family, who are forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, the new Lost in Space is officially described as being “a survival story for the ages.” \nCreated by Irwin Allen, the original Lost in Space premiered on CBS in 1965 and went on to last for three seasons and 85 episodes. The series focused on the intergalactic adventures of The Robinson family, who were originally sent into the stars aboard the Jupiter 2 for colonization, but the vessel was sabotaged by the backstabbing Dr. Zachary Smith, whose efforts to disrupt the trip resulted in the clan being stranded in the cosmos. \nZack Estrin serves as executive producer on the new Lost in Space alongside Sazama and Sharpless as well as Synthesis Entertainment’s Kevin Burns ( The Curse of Oak Island , Ancient Aliens ) and Jon Jashni ( Godzilla , Pacific Rim ) and Applebox’s Emmy -nominated director Neil Marshall ( Game of Thrones , The Descent ) and Marc Helwig. Marshall is also set to direct several episodes of the series. \nThe 10-episode first season is set to air in 2018. \n(Photo Credit: WENN.com)",

      "title": "Here's What's Streaming on Netflix in December",
      "text": "Share on Facebook Let's face it — you're already going to spend December laying around in your pajamas and getting fat on Toffifee, so you may as well use that as an excuse to binge on some Netflix. Fortunately, as always, the streaming behemoth is delivering the goods with plenty of new shows. If you want a particularly guilty pleasure (and we all know you do, you filthy animal), the streaming service is bringing back its unspeakably popular Full House revival Fuller House for a second season. The show, which is proof that we are a broken and sick world that doesn't know what's good for us, will return on December 9. Other Netflix shows returning for a second season are Club de Cuervos (December 9) and Ajin (December 27). If you want to dig around and try to find the new Stranger Things , the service is also unleashing a slew of brand new shows, including Pacific Heat (December 2), Fauda (December 2), White Rabbit Project (December 9), Four Seasons in Havana (December 9), Medici: Masters of Florence (December 9), Dirk Gently's Holistic Agency (December 11), Nobel (December 13), Crazyhead (December 16), Call Me Francis (December 16), The Break (December 20) and Chasing Cameron (December 27). If you crave some longform documentary series instead, the network will launch seasons of The Cuba Libre Story (December 8) and Captive (December 9). As if that weren't more than enough original content to get you through the season, the network has also got the original films Spectral (December 9) and the Barrack Obama college biopic Barry (December 16). Then there are also new comedy specials from Reggie Watts (December 6), Ricardo O'Farrill (December 12) and Gabriel Iglesias (December 20). If you're craving some film festival standouts, there are plenty hitting the service this month, including White Girl (December 1), Blue Jay (December 6), Other People (December 8) and Hunt for the Wilderpeople (December 24). Other movies hitting the service include 12 Years a Slave (December 1), The Hurt Locker (December 1), Sin City (December 1), Calvary (December 1), Eagle Eye (December 1), Get On Up (December 1), Jumanji (December 2), The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn: Part 1 (December 3), John Wick (December 4), Thor (December 9), Pitch Perfect (December 14), Captain America: Civil War (December 16), Annie (December 17), Miss Stevens (December 19), The Secret Life of Walter Mitty (December 20) and Citizenfour (December 25). You've also got some binging to do if you want to catch up on movies before they disappear. If, for example, you've yet to watch The Godfather somehow, you should do so by December 1. And if the new season of Gilmore Girls has you desperate to watch the movie version of Wild , you've also got to complete that before December 1. Other movies set to leave the service include Bridesmaids (December 1), Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb (December 1), Whiplash (December 8), Foxcatcher (December 18), Sinister (December 19) and Taken 3 (December 31).",

      "text": "Nov 22, 2016 4:04 PM (Photo: Gary Miller/Getty Images) Share Tweet \nNetflix has found the semi-sinister villain for its upcoming Lost In Space reboot , with Deadline reporting that Parker Posey has been cast in the role of saboteur-turned-shipmate Dr. Smith. Posey—who recently appeared in TBS’s Search Party , and as one of the deluded glory seekers in Christopher Guest’s Mascots —will star in the new streaming series opposite Toby Stephens, Maxwell Jenkins , and Taylor Russell , playing Dr., Will, and Judy Robinson, respectively. The series is scheduled for a 2018 debut. \nThe part of Dr. Smith was originated by Jonathan Harris, who initially played the character as a villain on Irwin Allen’s 1965 CBS show, before he was softened into more of a cowardly-but-lovable schemer as the series progressed. Posey, who’s no stranger to giving a fun , over-the-top villain turn , will hopefully inject a little more menace back into the character, although we’ll keep our fingers crossed that she doesn’t go full Gary Oldman and transform into a giant CGI spider two-thirds of the way through the show. \nSubmit your Newswire tips here",

      "text": "2016 1 min ago \nThe reins of the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)—the agency that fought to preserve net neutrality earlier this year—will now be held by staunch net-neutrality opponents. \nCurrent net-neutrality regulations bar telecom companies from manipulating the content people access, and from charging higher prices for priority delivery of different services. When a Washington DC circuit court backed those rules in June, telecom giants balked. Comcast, AT&T, and Verizon argued that net-neutrality rules stifle innovation and raise prices , but sites like Amazon and Netflix applauded the decision . It seemed like hours upon hours of un-throttled House of Cards viewing were in everyone’s future. \nNow all of that is in jeopardy. On Nov. 21, president-elect Donald Trump named two men to his FCC transition team: Mark Jamison , a former Sprint lobbyist, and Jeffrey Eisenach, an economist who worked for the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) during the Reagan administration. Eisenach was most recently a consultant for Verizon , and once wrote that “declaring the Internet a public utility is not necessary.” \nThe duo’s views on net neutrality may be a departure from the Obama administration, but Trump is staunchly against net neutrality . Telecom lobbyists, who have long hoped the case would end up in the Supreme Court , could doubly benefit if Trump also ends up choosing the next SCOTUS justice. Obama’s attack on the internet is another top down power grab. Net neutrality is the Fairness Doctrine. Will target conservative media. \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 12, 2014 \nThe loss of net-neutrality could spell bad news for consumers. Given the freedom to favor some content over others, major telcos will likely increase costs for streaming apps like Netflix, while favoring content providers with whom they’re affiliated or have deals. Those cost increases would fall on Netflix, which could easily pass them on to consumers. Read full story",

      "title": "Post-Election, Chelsea Handler Will Keep Fighting For What’s Right & Wants You To Do The Same",
      "text": "By Caitlin Flynn 6 hours ago \nDuring the May premiere of her new Netflix series, Chelsea Handler vowed to place the 2016 election front and center — and she held true to her word. For the past six months, she's interviewed a wide variety of political experts on nearly every episode and collaborated with Rock the Vote in an effort to galvanize millennials to get to the polls. In an interview with Bustle from the set of Chelsea at Sony Pictures Studios on Nov. 16, Handler reacts to Hillary Clinton's shocking loss to Donald Trump with disappointment, but notes that there are ways to honor the Obamas and Clinton through action and that comedy can provide healing and comfort during a time that's painful for many Americans. \nJust several hours after Clinton's concession speech on the morning of Nov. 9, Handler took the stage to film her post-election episode with special guest Senator Barbara Boxer. She had planned on a celebratory episode and says that it was a struggle to readjust the theme while she was still reeling from the election's outcome. \"I definitely came in and thought, 'I can't do this today, there's no way,'\" Handler tells Bustle. She says her staff reminded her that they and her viewers needed her more than ever, and Boxer was her anchor during the emotional episode. \n\"It wasn't easy to do, but Barbara was here and she said, 'I cancelled everything today and I didn't think I could come, but I know your audience is filled with young girls. I know your viewership and it's important that you do this today and I will be your anchor.' And she was,\" Handler remembers. \"She kept it together for me because I didn't know how I would. I mean, my face still hasn't recovered from crying so much.\" \nBoth Boxer and Handler teared up as they discussed the outcome, but Boxer emphasized the importance of moving forward and not giving up on our country despite this discouraging, painful setback. Handler has embraced her friend's advice and assured us that, despite her previous declarations, she won't permanently relocate to her home in Spain because she has an obligation to use her platform and voice here in America. \nHandler says that her show will remain politically-focused and that it's crucial to hold Trump accountable for his actions as president. \"We can't normalize this presidency,\" she says. \"We can't ever be complacent and say, 'Well, he's doing a couple good things here and there.' That's all well and good, but this is a man who bragged about sexually assaulting women and that's not a laughing matter,\" she says, r eferring to the leaked Access Hollywood tape of Trump talking about groping women which he dismissed as locker room talk. [Embed] \nWith Handler's new \"Trump Cam\" segment, viewers can rest assured that she won't let our president-elect off the hook for any despicable actions during his time as president. But, she emphasizes that we can simultaneously hold Trump accountable and use comedy as a distraction and a way to cope. \"Laughter's the only thing that gets us through a time like this,\" Handler says. \"I can't sing, I can't dance — I only have this ability to make people laugh so I want to honor the people who actually find me funny and be valuable to them. It's a way to forget about all the hatred and vitriol and not engage in it. There's a lot of strength to be found in laughter. That sounds corny, but it's so true.\" [Embed] \nIn addition to holding Trump accountable for his actions, Handler is looking to the future and will continue her efforts to get viewers involved in politics — after all, we have midterm elections in 2018 and, once again, we'll have the power to use our voices to shape our country. \"We have to get people involved in the midterm elections. We have to make people aware that it's cool to vote, it's cool to get involved politically, and being lazy is really a terrible excuse,\" Handler says. \"Do you ever want to look back at your life and say that you were uninformed? Women fought forever to get us the right to vote and it is sacrilege to not use that privilege and not exercise the right to vote.\" \nHowever, she cautions those of us who are politically active to be respectful as we try to rally our peers to get out and vote. \"Making people feel stupid if they're uninformed isn't the answer,\" Handler says. \"It's up to us to give them guidance and show them how to get information that's easily attainable so they can become excited about getting involved.\" \nThis message is so important — during the painful aftermath of this election, it's easy to become angry with people who didn't pay attention or vote in such a high-stakes race. But being condescending will only alienate them, so respectful discussions are the most effective way to get people involved and excited about voting. [Embed] \nHandler is committed to carrying on the good fight and she points out that we owe it to President Obama and Hillary Clinton to move forward. \"If we couldn't honor [Clinton] with the presidency, then we need to honor her with action,\" Handler says. After a painful week, Handler's words reminded me that the answer isn't to flee the country or give up — it's to stand up and keep fighting for what's right and do everything in our power to help those who could potentially be negatively impacted by a Trump presidency. As she says, we all owe it to Obama and Clinton because they've spent years fighting for us and our rights, and it's our time to fight now. \nImages: Grey Gayne/Netflix (2) ",

      "text": "Brad Barket /Invision/AP \nIt's no joke how much Dave Chappelle is reportedly making on his new comedy special deal with Netflix.\nAccording to The New York Post's Page Six column, the comedian is making a total of $60 million for delivering three comedy specials to the streaming company in 2017. \n\"Dave was offered $20 million a special,\" Page Six's anonymous source said. \"Netflix basically has a war chest for this kind of content. Whether it’s a loss or not, Dave Chappelle’s specials will get a lot of press and bring in new subscribers.\" \nAt $20 million per special, that would place Chappelle's deal on par with the reported $40 million deal Chris Rock secured with Netflix last month for two comedy specials.\nA Netflix representative told Business Insider it doesn't comment on the financial details of its deals.\nThe concert specials are Chappelle’s first  in 12 years. Two of the specials have already been shot, but were never released. The third one will be produced specifically for Netflix. All three are set to release  simultaneously in 2017. \nThe deal follows  Chappelle's hosting debut  November 12 on \"Saturday Night Live,\" which delivered the season's highest overnight ratings and the best 18-to-49 ratings for the show since 2013. \nChappelle made a huge name for himself while starring on \"Chappelle's Show,\" a racially charged sketch show that ran on Comedy Central from 2003 to 2006. Most recently, he's been trying out new material in an intimate venue tour . \nNOW WATCH: The 7 best horror movies you can stream on Netflix right now \n",

      "text": "By Kevin Fitzpatrick November 22, 2016 2:02 PM | ScreenCrush CBS / Jamie McCarthy, Getty Images \nMost of Netflix’s Lost in Space reboot casting has been fairly straightforward, but the addition of Dr. Smith is an interesting one. Rather than place another male actor in the role, the 2018 series has signed Parker Posey to portray the nefarious doctor responsible for the Robinson family predicament. \nPer Deadline , Parker will take the role of Dr. Smith (it remains unclear if the series plans to cast anyone outside the core roles of the original series), though few other details of the role are announced. The original 1965 character was played by Jonathan Harris, followed by the Gary Oldman version from the 1998 movie adaptation. \nParker joins House of Cards vet Molly Parker as Dr. Maureen Robinson , Black Sails star Toby Stephens as Professor John Robinson , along with Falling Skies star Taylor Russell as their eldest daughter Judy . \nNetflix previously set a 10-episode order for the new one-hour series, eyed for a 2018 debut under Prison Break alum Zack Estrin. Untold team Matt Sazama and Burk Sharpless will write the new version, producing Neil Marshall and Marc Helwig of Legendary TV, with Marshall likely to direct. So reads the new synopsis: \nTaking its cues from the original series, the show centers around the Robinson family, who is forced to come together in a time of crisis. Stranded light years from their intended destination, they find themselves battling a strange new alien environment and also their own personal demons. Equal parts family drama and sci-fi adventure, it is a survival story for the ages. \nThe original 1960s series saw 1997 future family the Robinsons heading into space for a 5-year mission, before the evil Dr. Smith sabotaged the mission and sent the family off-course. Crewed by John and Maureen Robinson, their children Penny, Judy and Will, as well as Major Don West, Doctor Smith and “Robot,” the original series aired on CBS for a grand total of 83 episodes over 3 seasons. \nIn addition to the 1998 film remake with William Hurt , Mimi Rogers, Gary Oldman, Lacey Chabert , Heather Graham and Matt LeBlanc , as well as an early attempt to revive the series as an NBC TV-movie, The WB filmed a 2003 pilot for a new Lost in Space directed by John Woo . \nThere’s no telling when the full Lost in Space casting might assemble, but what do we make of first real change?

      "text": "As his last days in office unfortunately come to a close, it’s safe to say that President Barack Obama ’s legacy has been firmly cemented in the minds and hearts of many. However before he officially surrenders the keys to the White House, he and FLOTUS Michelle may want to have a movie date courtesy of Netflix. The streaming service giant finally released the full trailer for its Obama biopic Barry , which is set to arrive just in time for the holiday season.\nAfter the summer release of the independent film Southside With You that detailed the love story between the President and First Lady, comes a second in-depth look at Obama and this time it shows how an ambitious college student went on to make American political history. Shadow and Act has further details regarding the film, including the synopsis and official Netflix release date.\nVia Shadow and Act:\nThe second of 2 (that we know of) young Barack Obama-related films making a splash this year, made its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival last month, to favorable reviews, dubbing it a crowd-pleaser, and heralding star Devon Terrell as a talent to watch. \nA week after its world premiere, Netflix bought worldwide rights to “Barry,” and has now set a December 16, 2016 release date for the film, on the premiere subscription VOD service. \n“Barry’s” official synopsis reads: It’s the Fall of 1981 and a young Barack Obama —known to his friends as “Barry”— arrives as a transfer student at Columbia University. Thrust into Mayor Koch’s racially fraught and crime-ridden New York City, Barry finds himself pulled between various social stratospheres. As he struggles to maintain a series of increasingly strained relationships—with his Kansas-born mother, his estranged Kenyan father, and his classmates —glaring issues of inequality force him to confront questions surrounding his own identity. His experiences over that pivotal school year begin to shape his views on race, government, and what it means to be an American. \nYou can check out the FULL trailer for Barry BELOW:\n \nCheck out today’s Top Stories here:\nhttp://hellobeautiful.com/2913481/robert-johnson-bet-donald-trump-meeting/ \nhttp://hellobeautiful.com/2913531/gabrielle-union-harpers-bazaar/ ",

      "text": "Subscribe to Club 93.7 on \n“You take the baton from the ones who’ve come before, and you carry it as far as you can. And maybe you hand it off.” \nSo opens the compelling trailer for Vikram Gandhi ’s upcoming Barack Obama biopic Barry , available to stream through Netflix on December 16. They’re portentous words, but then again, the trailer’s full of weighty signifiers of the life that its subject would go on to lead. Barry joins Obama in 1981, having just transferred as a college junior to Columbia University. The President-to-be attends classes, flirts with girls (including The Witch ’s Anya Taylor-Joy ) and makes friends (such as Ellar Coltrane of Boyhood fame), but all the while, flashes of his future greatness peek through. \nGandhi earned plaudits when the film played at the Toronto International Film Festival earlier this year, with many critics praising Devon Terrell’s even, nuanced turn as the young Obama as the student faces down threats on both sides, with racism from cops and intimidation from Black Panthers. With one black parent and one white, the college-aged Obama feels out of place in every racial context, making as much clear when he tells his mustachioed pal “I fit in nowhere.” It’s one of many weighty comments that predict the big future that the be-Afroed Barry has in store for him — another comes when he discusses the nature of change, the chiefest theme of the Obama administration, with the young woman played by Taylor-Joy. \nWith Obama preparing to cede his office to Donald Trump in a couple months’ time (assuming that Trump hasn’t been indicted, impeached, or otherwise invalidated by that point), this provides a nice sort of coda to the past eight years. It’ll be a while until we have another President with a comparably beastly jump shot.",

      "text": "Dave Chappelle Is Bringing Three Stand-Up Specials to Netflix Monday Nov 21, 2016 at 2:30 PM Nov 21, 2016 at 5:17 PM TV Guide \nHosting Saturday Night Live wasn't a fluke; Dave Chappelle is coming all the way back. \nNetflix announced Monday that the comedian will be releasing three stand-up specials on its streaming service in 2017: one all-new special produced by Netflix, and two from Chappelle's personal vault, previously recorded at Austin City Limits Live and The Hollywood Palladium. The specials are slated to be released simultaneously sometime in 2017. \nThe specials will be Chappelle's first since 2004's For What It's Worth. \nChappelle has done very little TV work since walking away from his beloved sketch series Chappelle's Show in 2005. After a few years of sporadic appearances, he heavily returned to stand-up in 2013, performing nearly 500 shows in the past three years, but hadn't done televised stand-up until his instant classic monologue on SNL after the election earlier this month. \n\"Dave Chappelle is a legendary voice in comedy -- searing, vital, and now more than ever, essential,\" Lisa Nishimura, Netflix's VP of Original Documentary and Comedy, said in a statement. \"Dave's three new specials promise to be some of the most anticipated events in comedy, and we are honored he will mark his global return on Netflix.\" Netflix also recently secured the stand-up special return of another iconic comedian, Chris Rock, who will be producing two specials for the streaming service, the first of which will tape next year. Rock is reportedly being paid $40 million for the specials. The terms of Chappelle's deal are not publicly known. Rock and Chappelle appeared together on SNL on Nov. 12. \nOther Links From TVGuide.com",
