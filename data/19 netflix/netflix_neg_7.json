      "text": "Critics Weigh In on Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life   \nA lot can change in 10 years. When Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Friday, Nov. 25, Rory Gilmore ( Alexis Bledel ) is not the same young woman she was when the popular series originally signed off in the spring of 2007. \nAfter turning down boyfriend Logan's ( Matt Czuchry ) rash marriage proposal, the studious Yale graduate was preparing to join then-Sen. Obama's campaign trail. Now a decade older, she's still very much on the road -- or at the very least, On the Road -ing it . For Bledel, who is married to her former Mad Men co-star Vincent Kartheiser and gave birth to the couple's first child in 2015, returning to the role that launched her career was a little surreal. \n\"Coming back to this character, you know she had grown up and it was interesting that we get to go back to the characters in real time because I have grown up the same amount probably, but in a very different environment,\" Bledel told a small group of press earlier this summer at the Television Critics Association summer press tour. \"So getting to think about her and where she's been -- I mean, it doesn't happen very often.\" \nGilmore Girls : What's the same? What's different? What you need to know Alexis Bledel, Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nSince Gilmore Girls signed off, much of the chatter surrounding the series has been about Rory's love life and which of the character's three long-term boyfriends ( Jared Padalecki' s Dean, Milo Ventimiglia 's Jess and Czuchry's Logan) was best suited for her. But that's never been the focus of the story; the heart of the series is the relationship between Rory, her mother, Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ), and grandmother, Emily ( Kelly Bishop ). \nAlthough Bledel couldn't divulge specifics about where her character is when the first of Netflix's four 90-minute episodes picks up, or what transpires between the three generations of strong-willed Gilmore women, she did reveal that Rory and Lorelai's dynamic has definitely changed as the two women have gotten older. \n\"Rory always kind of was the adult in the relationship and Lorelai would act more like a kid ... I think what that really was, for my character, was having to kind of try to make mom happy no matter what mom was going through. Her job was kind of -- she wasn't really being an adult. She was just kind of doing whatever would create harmony in her household in a sense,\" Bledel said. \"Now [Rory] is out living her own life and she's really just taking care of herself and trying to survive her day to day, which is not easy being a journalist in this day and age. \n\"For [Rory] just starting out, she's not that far along in her career but she's been doing it for a little while. And that's really been her main focus,\" Bledel continued. \"It's had to be for her to just survive her own life. So coming back to see her mom and stepping back into that dynamic that has now matured into something else, it's -- I don't think it's clear from the beginning, you know, where we pick up, what that looks like. I think it's something they discover as the story plays out.\" \nBut if you really must know, Rory's love life will be something that's uncovered as the story progresses, too. According to Bledel, everyone's questions surrounding Rory's love life will be answered by the end of the revival's fourth and final episode. There, are you happy now? \nAll four 90-minutes episodes of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premiere Friday, Nov. 25 on Netflix.",

      "text": "U.S. stock indexes were mixed Wednesday, as volume fell for a second day in a row.\nThe Nasdaq packed in a 0.4% gain, while the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones industrial average lost 0.2% and 0.3%, respectively. The Philadelphia semiconductor index led with a 1.1% advance. Volume in the stock market today was lower on both major exchanges vs. the previous session, according to preliminary figures.\nWhile some stocks in the bank and building sectors are already extended, stocks in other sectors are either in the 5% buy zone or are shaping bases that could lead to breakouts.\nInternet TV network Netflix ( NFLX ) has fallen about 8% since the election results became known. The action, though, could be constructive. Netflix is working on a cup-with-handle base. The handle is a bit deeper (14%) than desirable (8% to 12%). The potential buy point is 129.39. The base is first stage.\nAs a stock rises, it pauses to form bases. Breakouts from the first two bases are more likely to work than those from later consolidations.\nThe earnings outlook for Netflix is encouraging. After earnings fell 42% in 2015, the Street expects a 29% gain this year and 138% next year. Both represent upward revisions. Netflix is in the leisure sector, which was No. 11 of 33 sectors, according to preliminary data.\nMeanwhile, construction aggregates provider Vulcan Materials ( VMC ) is back in the 5% buy zone. The stock is 2% above a 127.30 buy point. Vulcan broke out Nov. 9 in huge volume and rose almost 9% before reversing.",

      "title": "Am I a Domestic Goddess, Or Just Boring?",
      "text": "Netflix Share this article \nI didn’t think my preference for binge watching Netflix over binge drinking made me boring, but I can’t help but feel like I’m missing some right of passage into adulthood. Like I’m not doing college right by not wasting away my weekends getting wasted. Like I’ve failed as a 20 year old by not having “wild” enough stories to tell. Have I spent my glory days wrapped up in a fuzzy blanket cocoon re-watching Vampire Diaries for the seventh time? \nI know I’m not the only college student who stays in on a Thursday night, but there’s always a part of me that feels guilty, like an extreme case of FOMO. While my friends are living out the college dream, I’m in bed tearing up at cute puppy photos. \nI pretty much have domesticity down. I mean… I’ve officially dubbed Fridays as my cleaning day. (Should I be embarrassed to admit that I find some weird satisfaction in the smell of Lysol?) I thoroughly enjoy watching home decorating shows on TV, I fantasize about pumpkin patches and ice-skating with my boyfriend, I get unreasonably excited about pillows, and I religiously believe that you should match your candle scent to the weather/season. \nBut when everyone asks me what I dressed up as this year for Halloween, or if I’m going to the party next weekend, or if my year in the wildest residence on campus was as crazy as they said it would be, I feel like I’m letting them down. Did I even go to college if I didn’t black out at least once a week, or even once for that matter? With ranked lists of “best party schools” and infamous frat parties, I can’t help but feel like I’m missing the “college experience.\" People don’t talk about all the sober Tuesdays they had that year at college; they go home and talk about how crazy all the parties were. \nThere are some perks, however, to my chosen lifestyle. I’ve laid out a few for my fellow homebodies: 1. I get hangover-free Sundays \nNo party is worth the impending doom of the morning after. 2. I have no regrets whatsoever \nWhat even is a walk of shame? 3. It's super cost-effective \nWhy spend money on alcohol when you could be in bed online shopping? 4. Pants are optional ​ \nNo pants are the best pants. 5. I can always get wine drunk! ​ \n​ \nWine makes everything better. \nSo if you’re like me and would choose a Friday Night Lights marathon over a club crawl every time, then raise your remotes! Here’s to embracing boring domesticity for all it has to offer. Because at the end of the day we’re wearing sweatpants, and they’re wearing stilettoes, so who is the real winner here?

      "text": "Privacy Policy The movie doesn’t get much more clever from there. Joe sells his book to an internet publisher and is soon mistaken for an actual assassin, kidnapped, and dispatched to Venezuela. Placing the trivial nonsense that ensues in a country that’s experiencing political and economic catastrophe is about as dicey as the movie gets. In an age when populist comedy seems to be competing in a permanent gross-out contest, “Assassin” is distinguished by its relative mild-manneredness. True Memoirs of an International Assassin | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix Video by Netflix US & Canada The same cannot be said about the Netflix work of Mr. James’s crony Mr. Sandler. If it’s not a “Grown Ups” sequel or an animated picture, Mr. Sandler’s movies for theatrical distribution have largely flopped in recent years. Mr. Sandler himself has changed as a performer. In younger days, he traded on a persona that split the difference between high school jock and high school goofball; in his middle age, he largely comes off as a guy who talks back to the car radio on the drive to work. \nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story In the recent Netflix film “The Do-Over,” he plays a guy named Max who shows up to his high school reunion wearing a name sticker that reads “Maxi-Pad.” Max tells a wimpy former classmate (played by David Spade) that he’s an F.B.I. agent with eight “kills.” (What is it with comedians creating regular guy characters who want to be assassins?) He then leads Mr. Spade on a life adventure packed with deliberately repellent sexual humor, misogyny and homophobia. While Mr. James’s “Assassin,” like his new television series, “Kevin Can Wait,” leans to bland safety, Mr. Sandler’s made-for-streaming efforts are even coarser than his theatrical output, which can get pretty coarse. Mr. Sandler has been contracted to create six movies for Netflix. The one he debuted with, “The Ridiculous 6,” is even more dispiriting than “The Do-Over.” I watched it only for the sake of research, and conveniently enough, it was waiting for me on my Netflix page. Why? Well, as it actually said on my page, “Because you watched ‘The Do-Over.’” That was a daunting sentence to read — almost an accusation. What should follow those words, I wondered. “Your late mother is very disappointed in you?” “You are going to hell?” The Ridiculous 6 | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix Video by Netflix US & Canada A western parody, “The Ridiculous 6” has relentlessly cretinous characters, moronic C.G.I. slapstick and cluelessly idiotic ethnic humor. (Several Native American actors walked off the set during production.) Under certain circumstances, its cast, which features Sandler regulars like Rob Schneider and Steve Buscemi and also acting heavyweights Nick Nolte and Harvey Keitel, might qualify as impressive. In this case, the presence of these performers tends to inspire dark thoughts about the intelligence and sensitivity of actors as a class. Nevertheless, “The Ridiculous 6” was the most-watched movie in Netflix history, according to its chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, though Netflix does not disclose viewership numbers. The value of “auteur-driven” television depends a lot on the auteur. A version of this article appears in print on November 20, 2016, on page AR14 of the New York edition with the headline: Going ….

After discovering Olaf’s scheme to steal their inheritance, the Baudelaire siblings escape and embark on an adventure to find out what happened to their parents, pursued by Olaf in a series of outlandish disguises. \nLemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events begins on Netflix on January 13 (yep, that’s a Friday).",

      "text": "8:43am PT by Kate Stanhope Netflix Unveils Official Trailer for 'Lemony Snicket' Series Courtesy of Netflix Joan Cusack, Alfre Woodard, Catherine O'Hara, Aasif Maandvi, and Don Johnson are just some of the familiar faces that pop up in the new footage. \nNeil Patrick Harris' transformation into Count Olaf for Netflix's upcoming adaptation of Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events is impressive to say the least, but its just one of several disguises the Emmy winner sports in the first official trailer for the series. \nReleased Thursday, the new footage from the highly anticipated eight-episode series shows Harris deep in the character of Count Olaf, the evil guardian of the Baudelaire orphans — Violet, Klaus and Sunny — who will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. As the children manage to evade Count Olaf's scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they begin to pick up clues about their parents' past. However, Count Olaf is determined to get what he wants. \n\"Wherever you go, I will hunt you down,\" he tells the children ominously in the trailer. \nBased on the international best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler), the series also stars Patrick Warburton (as Snicket himself), Joan Cusack, Alfre Woodard, Catherine O'Hara, Aasif Maandvi, and Don Johnson among others. \nThe eight-episode series is produced by Netflix and hails from exec producers Barry Sonnenfeld and Handler. \nWatch the full trailer below: \n\nLemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13, 2017 on Netflix.

      "text": "EMAIL \nA Series Of Unfortunate Events is probably Netflix’s next big series, not least because after a little time away doing stage work and reminding us he’s a national treasure, Neil Patrick Harris is back . And in a lot of disguises, no less! \nIf you’re unfamiliar with the series, it follows the Baudelaire children, whose parents pass away in a fire and find themselves dealing with their uncle, Count Olaf, a homicidal supervillain who will stop at nothing to bump off the kids and collect their family fortune. The books have a lot of fun with the cheesy Victorian adventure story tropes that drive the plot, including author Daniel Handler spoofing his own role as the omniscient narrator. There’s a reason his pseudonym on the books is Lemony Snicket . \nThe series itself has a suitable mock-Gothic vibe and sense of unreality, right down to Patrick Warburton playing Snicket. The series, like the books, seems to have a nice degree of self-awareness; one clip from the trailer has Olaf admit he’s mostly doing this because trolling small children in disguises is fun for him. It’ll presumably be fun for us, as well, but we’ll find out soon enough. Netflix will premiere the show on Friday, January 13.",

      "text": "Netflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events': NPH Wigs Out in First Official Trailer Andy Swift Pin it Share Neil Patrick Harris is a man of many hats — and wigs, and even a dress at one point — in the official trailer for Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events . RELATED Gilmore Girls Review: Just Like You Remember, and Exactly What You Need Based on Lemony Snicket’s beloved children’s book series, Unfortunate Events stars Harris as Count Olaf, a sinister figure who becomes the guardian of three young orphans — though he’s far more interested in getting his hands on their inheritance than he is in “guarding” them. The trailer also contains the first footage of Joan Cusack ( Shameless ) as Justice Strauss and Catherine O’Hara ( Schitt’s Creek ) as Dr. Orwell. A Series of Unfortunate Events ‘ first season drops Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. Hit PLAY on the trailer above, then drop a comment with your thoughts below.",

      "text": "Tumblr  47AM PT \nAfter a bit of a tease, Netflix has released the full trailer for its forthcoming TV adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” full of Neil Patrick Harris in various forms of (debatably effective) disguise. Harris is the nefarious Count Olaf, antagonist to the three precocious Baudelaire children placed in his care after their parents are killed. As siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny attempt to escape the deadly schemes Olaf concocts to try and steal their parents’ fortune, they discover more about their parents’ wild past. \nParamount TV and Netflix began the adaptation process in 2014 , a full decade after a movie franchise starring Jim Carrey as Olaf sputtered in 2004. The first season of Netflix’s show will cover four of the 13 novels in Daniel Handler’s book series — two episodes for each book. \nIn addition to Harris, Patrick Warburton plays narrator Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissman is Violet Baudelaire, and Louis Hynes is Klaus Baudelaire; Alfre Woodard, Joan Cusack and Aasif Mandvi take over various featured roles. T he series is created by Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld of “Men in Black” and “The Addams Family” fame. \nThe first season of “A Series of Unfortunate Events” will premiere, appropriately enough, on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. \nWatch the trailer above, or on YouTube.

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Why President Trump Might Be Good for Tech Companies \nThe biggest tech stocks have been suffering since the surprise election of Donald Trump as president. Shares of Apple and Alphabet have lost 2%, Facebook and Amazon 4%, and Netflix 7% since last week. \nAt the same time, the overall market has rallied with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gaining 5%. \nNow some analysts who follow the tech industry are arguing that the sell-off is overdone and big tech company stocks are bargains. \n“Concerns of President-Elect Trump’s impact on tech companies (are) being largely extrapolated from sound bites that are unlikely to manifest during Trump’s presidency,” Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray pointed out in a report on Thursday. “Valuations are very attractive for each of the mega-caps, which have sold off despite any clear political reason.” \nMunster recommended that investors buy shares of five companies: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon amzn , and Netflix nflx . Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nThe prior Trump rhetoric that has scared some investors includes his threats to investigate Amazon for antitrust violations, a call to boycott Apple for not helping the FBI, and accusing Alphabet’s Google of helping rig the election . Expectations that Trump could gut net neutrality rules have hurt Netflix. More generally, Trump’s opposition to current policies on immigration, offshore manufacturing, and free trade could also hurt the big tech companies that have benefitted from those same policies. \nBut a more realistic assessment, at least according to Scott Kessler, an analyst at CFRA Research, indicates that the policies Trump is most likely to pursue in the areas of regulation, taxes, and trade could favor tech companies. \n“We see a stronger U.S. economy and less regulation as good for bigger technology companies,” Kessler wrote in Nov. 15 report. “In particular, we think easing or eliminating net neutrality would favor the biggest and best-capitalized companies able to most easily pay for faster and better access, and provide competitive advantages. We also believe certain technology companies could actually be aided by Trump’s focus on smarter trade deals and practices.” \nKessler recommended shares of Alphabet goog , Apple aapl , Facebook fb , and Intel intc . \nHowever, technology analysts are hardly experts on politics and have no special insight into which policies the incoming Trump administration will actually pursue. Investors should weigh even a small risk of a trade war or new tariffs on products made in China because either outcome would crush many tech stocks. So the recommendations to buy beaten down tech stocks could turn out to be just as misguided as the reports from finance sector analysts to buy sagging shares of banks and insurance companies in 2007. To learn about sectors seen as benefitting from Trump, watch: \nOne piece of the tech proponents case seems especially weak. Both Kessler and Munster mention that Trump is likely to lower the tax on bringing untaxed foreign earnings back into the United States. Major tech companies have the most cash “trapped” overseas amid some $1.3 trillion overall. \nBut the tech companies have already found ways around the repatriation tax, by issuing debt against the cash hoards and by using the money to fund takeovers of foreign companies. Studies of the last tax break for overseas cash found that most of the money was used in unproductive ways that did not bolster the economy much. \nSo while it may be true that irrational fears of a Trump presidency have hurt tech stock prices, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the stocks will be top performers in the future.

      "title": "Nov 17 - Disney eye's Netflix purchase",
      "text": "Nov 17 - Disney eye's Netflix purchase The great Queen Elsa once said, \" Let it go, let it go/Can't hold it back anymore/Let it go, Let it go/Turn my back and slam the door.\" So will the heads of Netflix let it go? Disney is eyeing the company for a possible purchase in the near future. The house of Mouse is truly reciting Queen Elsa's song to Netflix. ESPN (which is under Disney's wing of owned companies) subscription numbers have been gradually declining as of late, forcing the parent company to look for ways to stop the bleeding. And Netflix may be the answer. Disney is taking a hard look at Netflix after the company crushed Wall Streets expectations with its Q3 earnings and increased its international subscription numbers. Time will tell if this comes to fruition and we will keep you up to date on the possible deal and what this may mean for small businesses.",

Both new specials are set to be released in 2017. \nOn Jan. 24, “Gad Gone Wild” will premiere in all Netflix territories around the world. The show – which is based on Elmaleh's one man show of the same name – is performed primarily in French with some English and Arab mixed in as he entertains the audience with the hilarious scenarios he has experienced as an international comedian. \n“For a long time I've seen my favorite humorists on Netflix. Today this is a true honor to know that I'll soon be among them. Netflix's vision totally fits with mine when it comes to humor and creation crossing borders. Knowing that we can access content at any time on Netflix specially when it comes to stand up comedies joins the energy of the live performances,\" said Elmaleh in a statement. \n2017 is already shaping up to be a great year for the streaming service when it comes to comedy content. Along with Elmaleh, Chris Rock is also working with Netflix on a pair of new original comedy specials. Ricky Gervais' latest project “David Brent: Life on the Road” will premiere on Feb. 10, 2017, as well. The SVOD giant also has an impressive collection of stand-up specials premiering throughout the remainder of 2016. “ Michael Che Matters ” is set to debut on Nov. 25 with new works from Reggie Watts and Gabriel Iglesias to follow in December. \nElmaleh has a string of shows scheduled in France through December and he will return to the United States on Jan. 19 for a performance at the Gothic Theatre in Denver, CO. Portland, San Diego and New Orleans are among the other great cities in which Elmaleh will be delivering stand-up sets on his North American Tour. \nCheck out a clip from when Elmaleh made his English-language stand-up debut on “Conan” earlier this year and click here to pick-up tickets to see him perform live in a city near you.

      "text": "*The following post is from Trader Scott's Market Blog:*\n\nNetflix presents a new exclusive series, \"The Deportables\".\nIn this action packed pilot episode, the Deportables close ally, the Delusionals, are called in from their safe spaces to rescue their 200 year old leader, George Morose. He has been taken hostage by their arch enemy, the Deplorables, led by the flamboyant Milo Yploplaplous. Milo is in good spirits as he is sporting a new do and mani-pedi. But after a brief confrontation, the Delusionals are able to free their ancient, shriveled leader, Mr. Morose. The Delusionals used their tried and true weapons - relentlessly cursing, crying, yelling incoherently, monotonously chanting weird slogans, throwing eggs, sucker punching, rioting, marching, destroying private property, and making completely false accusations. The Delusionals are ecstatic with their success. And they are further buoyed to hear of some uplifting news about one of the Deportables, the chiseled Michael Hussein, who had been deported to Kenya. She is the ex wife of former world leader Barry Hussein. The good news is Michael has decided to pursue her life long dream, competing in the Mr. Universe body building competition. But alas, the Delusionals are stunned to hear about their icon, the swashbuckling Barry Hussein. He had been found splattered on the pavement soon after landing in Qatar, where he had been deported. Predictably, Barry had been thrown off the top of a tall building, promptly upon his arrival in Doha. \nYou can follow the brave exploits of the the Delusionals and the Deportables streamed exclusively on Netflix this winter. Stay tuned for episode two.",

      "text": "MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" will stay behind bars while state attorneys appeal a decision overturning his conviction, a panel of federal appellate judges ruled Thursday. Brendan Dassey's release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.\nDassey, 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier.\nIn August, a federal judge overturned Dassey's conviction, ruling investigators coerced him into confessing. Wisconsin's Department of Justice appealed that decision to the 7th Circuit.\nThe judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. on Friday. The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit hours later seeking to block the release.\nTodd Richmond, The Associated Press",

The state Justice Department has appealed that ruling. Still, the judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nThe Justice Department filed an emergency motion with the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Wednesday asking it to block the release, arguing Dassey’s confession was voluntary and that the 27-year-old inmate poses a danger to society.\nDassey’s attorneys filed a reply brief late Wednesday arguing that Dassey has behaved well in prison and that the state hasn’t identified any harm that might come from his release.\nFederal inspection shows...",

      "text": "Privacy Policy The 10-part Netflix series by Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos, released in December, suggested that police investigators had coerced Mr. Dassey, then 16, into a confession and had unfairly questioned him without a lawyer or parent present. It portrayed him as mentally unfit. “The investigators repeatedly claimed to already know what happened on October 31 and assured Dassey that he had nothing to worry about,” Judge Duffin wrote in overturning the conviction. “These repeated false promises, when considered in conjunction with all relevant factors, most especially Dassey’s age, intellectual deficits, and the absence of a supportive adult, rendered Dassey’s confession involuntary under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.” \nAdvertisement Continue   Brad Schimel, the Wisconsin attorney general, appealed that decision in September. “We believe the magistrate judge’s decision that Brendan Dassey’s confession was coerced by investigators, and that no reasonable court could have concluded otherwise, is wrong on the facts and wrong on the law,” Mr. Schimel said in a statement. “Two state courts carefully examined the evidence and properly concluded that Brendan Dassey’s confession to sexually assaulting and murdering Teresa Halbach with his uncle, Steven Avery, was voluntary, and the investigators did not use constitutionally impermissible tactics.” Mr. Dassey’s case does not directly affect that of Mr. Avery, whose conviction was also examined in the Netflix series. Mr. Avery’s new lawyer has said she hoped new forensic testing and evidence could lead to his exoneration, or at least to a new trial. Netflix said in July that the series would return for new episodes that would “provide an in-depth look at the high-stakes post-conviction process, as well as the emotional toll the process takes on all involved.” A release date has not been announced.",

Jones , USA TODAY 2:06 p.m. EST November 17, 2016 \nThe key art for Netflix's 'A Series of Unfortunate Events.' (Photo: Netflix) \nIf you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off watching another series. This is the story of the Baudelaire youngsters, whose life unfolds in A Series of Unfortunate Events . \nThe full trailer for Netflix's show adapting the best-selling books hit the Internet Thursday — and it’s as rife with misfortune, misery and despair as one would expect. \nWatch as Violet (Malina Weissman, who you may recognize from Supergirl ), Klaus (Louis Hynes), and baby Sunny (Presley Smith) are plucked from their home after their parents perish in a terrible fire, and are left to defend themselves against their new guardian, Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris), who will stop at nothing — not even a bad wig — to steal their fortune. Fans of the book series may recognize some eyes around and many a Count Olaf disguise. \nA Series of Unfortunate Events arrives on Netflix Jan. 13.

Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.\nDassey, 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier.\nIn August, a federal judge overturned Dassey's conviction, ruling investigators coerced him into confessing. Wisconsin's Department of Justice appealed that decision to the 7th Circuit.\nThe judge on Wednesday ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. on Friday. The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit hours later seeking to block the release.\nAssociated Press \n  U.S. Department of Justice",

And from there, things just seem to get whimsically darker in the Netflix original series. \nIn addition to the trailer, a new official poster for the series has also been released by Netflix: \nNetflix revealed the official poster for Lemon Sniket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.\nContinue reading… ",

      "text": "Here’s The Full Trailer For Netflix’s LEMONY SNICKET’S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS Well, this thing looks amazing. By Scott Wampler Nov. 17, 2016 \nAfter teasing for months, Netflix has finally dropped the first full trailer for next year's Lemony Snicket's A Series Of Unforunate Events on us, and holy moly, is this thing gorgeous. \nLet's take a look. \nKinda hard not to marvel at the production design here, no? This looks like it could be one of the priciest shows in Netflix history. That's irrelevant to the quality of the series, of course, but then, I'm not concerned about that, either: everything here looks on point, from Neil Patrick Harris' appropriately-bizarro turn as Count Olaf, to Patrick Warbuton's pitch-perfect take on Lemony Snicket to the moment where I literally said \"Oh my fucking god is that Joan Cusack ?!\" out loud while watching the trailer. I'm into all of this. \nLemony Snicket's A Series Of Unfortunate Events hits Netflix on January 13th. You will binge it until you perish (a phrase which here means \"until you die\").

      "text": "\nIn the mood for some Foxy Brown but don’t know where to find it? Jonesing for a little Black Caesar ? Do you not have a clue about any of this? Well, by golly, this post is for you! Bounce TV has launched a brand new subscription service called Brown Sugar, featuring only blaxsploitation films. It’s being touted as “a black explosion of hot chicks, cool cats and cult classics,” according to Variety . Think of it as “like Netflix, only blacker.”\nRight now, the service has 111 movies in its catalogue including The Mack , Shaft , Super Fly , Dolemite , Cotton Comes to Harlem , Uptown Saturday Night , Cooley High , Five on the Black Hand Side , Cleopatra Jones , Mandingo , Willie Dynamite , Which Way is Up? , Car Wash and The Original Gangstas . You can sign up for it in Apple iTunes, the Google Play Store or on its website . Like Netflix, a one-month free trial is available. After that, it costs $3.99 per month.\nIn order to get people interested, they’ve already enlisted the likes of Pam Grier and Fred “The Hammer” Williamson (who both appeared in quite a few of these films) as spokespersons, as well as rapper Rick Ross for some reason. “These movies are entertaining and fun, but they were also empowering to the black community as they depicted African-Americans as strong leading characters and heroes for the first time,” Grier said.\nWill you be subscribing?\n(via Variety , image via screencap)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Meet the cast of new Netflix drama The Crown Everything you need to know about the cast and characters of Netflix's £100m series ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy Radio Times staff Thursday 17 November 2016 at 6:49PM \nThe Crown is a brand new Netflix original series, which dramatises Queen Elizabeth II's early reign, revealing the personal intrigues, romances, and political rivalries behind the great events that shaped the second half of the 20th Century. \nIt's a 10-part series and is Netflix’s most expensive and ambitious project to date. \n“The Crown brings with it a set of responsibilities and fundamentally realigns the power structure in a way that can only be challenging,” says Peter Morgan, the show's creator. Suddenly, Elizabeth is no longer just a wife, a sister, or a daughter. She is the Queen, the head of the family, the head of state, the head of the Church of England, and the head of the Commonwealth of Nations. \n“What’s made it so interesting to write is not this or that historical event,” says Morgan. “It’s been that this is a family, and within that family is the Crown, and the Crown is a bomb that changes the structure of everything.” \nClaire Foy and Matt Smith are playing the royal couple, but there's plenty more of the cast you need to meet... Claire Foy – Queen Elizabeth II \nPrincess Elizabeth expects to have many years of married bliss before ascending to the throne, but no such luck. Her simple life is cut short when her father, King George VI, dies unexpectedly, and at the age of 25, she inherits the Crown and the unimaginable burden that comes with it. \n“Peter Morgan’s Elizabeth is a quite naïve, sheltered person,” says Foy. “She has been brought up very well, to respect people and do the right thing. But she’s grown up from the age of eleven knowing that she was going to be Queen one day. \n“Ultimately, I think she’s a very kind, loving, strong, determined, funny, clever person. Sometimes she’s allowed to show it, and sometimes she’s not.” \nWhere do I recognise her from? \nFoy is no stranger to period dramas – she played Anne Boleyn in Wolf Hall and appeared in Upstairs Downstairs. She is also known for Season of the Witch, Going Postal and Wreckers. Matt Smith – Prince Philip \nPhilip, the Duke of Edinburgh, is in many ways the opposite of his wife. He is reluctant to be browbeaten by the British Establishment, and has his own cross to bear surrounding his own family history. Emotionally orphaned as a young boy, Philip’s greatest sense of loss is that of the tight family unit that he worked so hard to create. \n“He is a loyal person, he has a sort of irreverence and curiosity,” says Smith. “He has a thirst for progress, knowledge and modernity. Plus, he’s got a great sense of humour.” \nWhere do I recognise him from? \nDoctor Who, of course! He was the eleventh – and youngest – person to play the Doctor. Smith also appeared in The Ruby In The Smoke and Diary of Call Girl with Billie Piper, had a role in BBC's Party Animals, and popped up in Pride and Prejudice and Zombies in 2016.",

Until no! Bwahahaha!\nThe TV adaptation features Neil Patrick Harris as the creepy Count Olaf. Joan Cusack will also appear in the series. Emmy Award winning producer Barry Sonnenfield of The Adams Family is also on board, Variety reports.\nThe first season of Lemony SNicket’s a Series of Unfortunate Events will consist of eight episodes and premieres, appropriately, on Friday, Jan. 13.",

      "text": "More '80s than a John Hughes movie marathon, Netflix's Stranger Things was the surprise TV sensation of 2016. Seriously, post-July, people just wouldn't shut up about it. Eleven, the Upside Down, the Demogorgon, Steve Harrington's hair... All became iconic overnight. Six weeks after the first eight episodes dropped, Netflix confirmed a second season (though it later transpired that they'd been lying to us, the swines, and had already ordered more before the show had even launched). Here's everything we know about the much-anticipated sequel to the Duffer Brothers' loving tribute to Spielberg, Carpenter and King. Stranger Things season 2 air date: when can I watch? Netflix has confirmed that there'll be more freaky goings-on in Hawkins next year – though we don't have anything more specific than 2017 as a return date right now. Stranger Things cast: Who's back, and who's joining the fun? sƃuıɥʇɹǝƃuɐɹʇs# ɹɐǝʎ ʇxǝu noʎ ǝǝs uoıʇɔnpoɹd uı ʞɔɐq A photo posted by @strangerthingstv on Nov 4, 2016 at 10:06am PDT Of course, the boys are back: Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas and Gaten Matarazzo as the inimitable Dustin. There'll also be a whole lot more of Will now that he's returned, transformed, from the Upside Down – with actor Noah Schnapp promoted from recurring to series regular. Winona Ryder is returning as frazzled Joyce Byers, as are Cara Buono as Karen Wheeler and David Harbour as Jim Hopper (though surely the haunted cop's not really turned to the dark side?). And things won't be getting any easier for Nancy Wheeler (Natalie Dyer), with both moody outsider Jonathan Byers (Charlie Heaton) and reformed douchebag Steve Harrington (Joe Kerry) still on the scene. But will Stranger Things still be turning things up to Eleven? Of course it will – Millie Bobby Brown is confirmed to be reprising her role as the sweet but terrifying telekinetic wonder. There'll be no #Justice4Barb though, with series creators Matt and Ross Duffer confirming that Shannon Purser's beloved geek will stay dead, but \"will not be forgotten\". Despite his apparent death at the hands of the Demogorgon, \"Bad Man\" Brenner (Matthew Modine) is also being revived for season two, though he'd better watch his back... \"If the Monster is dead, was it a singular monster?\" teased Matt Duffer. \"What else could be out there? There's a lot more mystery there to be solved.\" But wait, there's more! Stranger Things will be bulking out its cast in 2017 with some new additions: tough 13-year-old girl Max (Sadie Sink), her cocksure stepbrother Billy (Dacre Montgomery) and the mysterious Roman (Linnea Berthelsen). [Above: New cast members Sadie Sink and Dacre Montgomery] And there'll be a few more '80s icons joining Ryder and Modine, too: starting with The Goonies favourite Sean Astin, who'll play Bob Newby, a kind-hearted nerd who went to high school with Joyce (Winona Ryder) and Hopper (David Harbour) and now manages the Hawkins RadioShack. Then there's Paul Reiser (Aliens), joining the series as Dr Owens – a high-ranking member within the Department of Energy on a \"clean-up\" assignment, tasked with containing the events of last year. Stranger Things episodes – how many can we expect? There'll be nine episodes in season two - and we even know what they'll be called: 1 - Madmax 2 - The Boy Who Came Back to Life 3 - The Pumpkin Patch 4 - The Palace 5 - The Storm 6 - The Pollywog 7 - The Secret Cabin 8 - The Brain 9 - The Lost Brother You can read our rampant speculation here on what these episode names might giveaway about season two – though the Duffer bros. have cautioned that the titles may change before the season drops. Stranger Things season 2: is there a trailer? Believe it or not, yes there is – at least, there's an early teaser scored by Kyle Dixon and Michael Stein's synth-tastic theme tune. Stranger Things theories: will any of this happen? Stranger Things fan theories are so plentiful that they now form approximately 23.8% of the entire internet. Honest. We've got our own thoughts as to what went on in the first eight episodes, and what might be coming in season two – which you can read right here. Warning: possible spoilers! In the meantime, here's what we know 100% about season two (and that's a real stat): It'll be set in late 1984, a year after the events of the first season, and will venture outside of Hawkins, Indiana. In fact, according to Matt Duffer, \"the opening scene [of the premiere] does not take place in Hawkins.\" Could that scene take place in the Upside Down? Certainly, we've only seen \"a tiny bit\" of the show's dark netherworld, which will be explored \"a little bit more\" in season two. Oh, and the new Stranger Things will be \"next level\" crazy, a \"little darker\" and \"a little weirder\" – if we're talking '80s, think of this season as Temple of Doom compared to season one's Raiders... Stranger Things season 3: what does the future hold? So what's in store for Eleven and the gang beyond season two? Surely given the incredible success of Stranger Things, we're looking at a show with a long lifespan? It's looking very probable, with a third season already in the planning stages... \"We are not gonna be caught off guard,\" said producer/director Shawn Levy. \"So we are definitely optimistic and we have started thinking ahead.\"",

      "text": "Gad Elmaleh to team-up with Netflix on two new comedy specials By: Laurie Fanelli Nov 17, 2016 2 hours ago 73 6 y2016m11d17 110139 Team Coco \nFrench comedian Gad Elmaleh is already an international success, but the stand-up star is set to take things to the next level as he is teaming up with Netflix for a pair of comedy specials. Both new specials are set to be released in 2017. \nOn Jan. 24, “Gad Gone Wild” will premiere in all Netflix territories around the world. The show – which is based on Elmaleh's one man show of the same name – is performed primarily in French with some English and Arab mixed in as he entertains the audience with the hilarious scenarios he has experienced as an international comedian. \n“For a long time I've seen my favorite humorists on Netflix. Today this is a true honor to know that I'll soon be among them. Netflix's vision totally fits with mine when it comes to humor and creation crossing borders. Knowing that we can access content at any time on Netflix specially when it comes to stand up comedies joins the energy of the live performances,\" said Elmaleh in a statement. \n2017 is already shaping up to be a great year for the streaming service when it comes to comedy content. Along with Elmaleh, Chris Rock is also working with Netflix on a pair of new original comedy specials. Ricky Gervais' latest project “David Brent: Life on the Road” will premiere on Feb. 10, 2017, as well. The SVOD giant also has an impressive collection of stand-up specials premiering throughout the remainder of 2016. “ Michael Che Matters ” is set to debut on Nov. 25 with new works from Reggie Watts and Gabriel Iglesias to follow in December. \nElmaleh has a string of shows scheduled in France through December and he will return to the United States on Jan. 19 for a performance at the Gothic Theatre in Denver, CO. Portland, San Diego and New Orleans are among the other great cities in which Elmaleh will be delivering stand-up sets on his North American Tour. \nCheck out a clip from when Elmaleh made his English-language stand-up debut on “Conan” earlier this year and click here to pick-up tickets to see him perform live in a city near you.

      "text": "\nNetflix’s adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events finally has a full-length trailer, and fans of the books will no doubt have a great time trying to pick out all the symbols and objects. We have Gothic buildings, Violet Baudelaire inventing, secret codes, and, of course, eye symbols galore. Already, the series has a very distinctive look from the coloring to the ambiguous time period. For example, Neil Patrick Harris’ Olaf makes a reference to the internet, but there are also intense 1920s vibes from Irving Berlin’s “Blue Skies” and the backdrop–though this is very much evocative of the anachronisms from the book series.\nOther exciting things I noticed was that the cast is much more diverse, and several key characters are played by actors of color. It’s a small detail, but a pleasant surprise considering how I’m used to white-as-default in adaptations. Aasif Mandvi is totally going to crush it as Uncle Monty, as will Alfre Woodard as Aunt Josephine and K. Todd Freeman as Mr. Poe.\nI think author Daniel Handler’s role a executive producer shines through, or at the very least a huge amount of appreciation for the books by the showrunners. The trailer showcases a lot of humor in the show that reflects the black humor of Handler’s writing. I’m especially intrigued by Patrick Warburton’s Lemony Snicket, and it’ll be interesting to see what kind of role he’ll play.\nWhat do you think about the trailer?\n(via Deadline )\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "October 30, 2015 | 12:29PM PT \n“ Longmire ” has been renewed for Season 5 by Netflix . \nAfter being canceled by A&E , Netflix nabbed the Western crime drama for Season 4. The 10-episode run launched this past September on the streaming service. The series previously aired on A&E for three seasons. \nThe renewal announcement was made Friday on “Longmire’s” Facebook page with the message, “We’ve never been one to back down from a fight. Longmire will return to Netflix for Season 5.” See More: The New Age of TV: Is Anything Really Ever Cancelled? \nCreated by Hunt Baldwin and John Coveny, “Longmire” stars Robert Taylor as the sheriff of a small town in Wyoming. Katee Sackhoff, Lou Diamond Phillips, Cassidy Freeman and Adam Bartley round out the cast. Baldwin and Coveny exec produce with Greer Shephard and Michael Robin. \nThis summer at the Television Critics Assn. press tour, Coveny expressed the “Longmire” team’s excitement, ahead of its fourth season premiere at its new home. “Netflix said, ‘We want human beings to watch this show — if it has heart and soul to it, we need that piece in the Netflix family.’” \nShepard added, “We’re mercifully with a wonderful company now that values viewers over demos and we’re benefiting from that.” Filed Under:",

      "text": "A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" will stay behind bars while state attorneys appeal a decision overturning his conviction, a panel of federal appellate judges ruled Thursday.\nBrendan Dassey's release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.\n\"We are disappointed more than words can say,\" Dassey's attorneys, Steve Drizin and Laura Nirider, said in a statement posted online shortly after the ruling was released. \"The fight goes on.\"\nDassey, now 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. He confessed to detectives that he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate proceeding.\nJudge orders 'Making a Murderer' inmate Brendan Dassey released from prison A U.S. judge has ordered \"Making a Murderer\" inmate Brendan Dassey must be released from prison.

(Photo: Sue Pischke/AP | Video: CBS Miami)\nSee more videos Avery and Dassey contend they were framed by police angry with Avery for filing a lawsuit against the county over his wrongful imprisonment for a sexual assault he didn't commit. He's pursuing his own appeal in state court.\nTheir cases gained national attention last year after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer,\" a multi-part documentary examining Halbach's death. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the documentary was biased but the series generated calls from the public to free both men.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 years old at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and overturned his conviction. Duffin said in the decision that if state attorneys appealed the ruling Dassey would remain in prison pending a resolution.\nThe state Justice Department filed an appeal that is still working its way through the 7th Circuit. But this week Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nJudge orders 'Making a Murderer' inmate Brendan Dassey released by Friday; state appeals Tribune news services A federal judge told Wisconsin prison officials on Wednesday that they must release an inmate featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" by Friday evening.\nIt's unclear if Brendan Dassey will finally walk free, however. Hours after U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin issued his release...\nA federal judge told Wisconsin prison officials on Wednesday that they must release an inmate featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" by Friday evening.\nIt's unclear if Brendan Dassey will finally walk free, however. Hours after U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin issued his release...\n(Tribune news services) The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit on Wednesday seeking to block the release, arguing Duffin's release order contradicts his original ruling in which he said Dassey would remain in prison pending the appeal's resolution, Dassey's interrogators used techniques that courts around the country have repeatedly approved and Dassey presents a danger to society.\nDrizin and Nirider countered with a filing that argued Dassey has behaved in prison and the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release.\nThe 7th Circuit judges — Frank Easterbrook, Kenneth Ripple and David Hamilton, issued a two-page ruling Thursday saying only that the state's emergency motion was granted and Dassey will remain behind bars pending the outcome of the appeal.\nAssociated Press \nCopyright © 2016, Hartford Courant U.S. Department of Justice",

      "text": "0 comments \nNetflix has acquired Spectral , the Legendary Pictures-produced action sci-fi film that was pulled from its August release this summer, Deadline is reporting.. \nDirected by Nic Mathieu and starring James Badge Dale ( World War Z ), Max Martini ( Pacific Rim ), Emily Mortimer ( Shutter Island ), and Bruce Greenwood ( Super 8 ), the film follows “ a special ops team who battle supernatural entities taking over a European city. ” \nThe film is being likened to Ridley Scott’s Black Hawk Down and Ghostbusters , only with ghosts and supernatural entities. In it, a brilliant DARPA scientist embarks on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a battle-scarred, war-torn city, where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilians deaths. \nSpectral is based on a story by Ian Fried and Mathieu, and it was scripted by George Nolfi. Thomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Jillian Share produced it. The film was shot primarily on location in various war-torn streets and buildings in Budapest, Hungary, relying extensively on practical effects and locations for an authentic, gritty atmosphere firmly planted in reality. The film has a score by Junkie XL ( Batman v Superman and Deadpool ). The futuristic weapons were produced by Peter Jackson’s Weta Workshop and the VFX was done by Weta Digital, overseen by Oscar winners Joe Letteri and Erik Winquist.",

      "text": "VIDEO: Official Trailer for Netflix's LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS Is Here! November 17  by TV News Desk \n\"If you are interested in stories with happy endings, then you would be better off somewhere else.\" - Lemony Snicket \nAvert your eyes from the tragic and horrible sight of the official trailer for LEMONY SNICKET'S A SERIES OF UNFORTUNATE EVENTS. Watch it below! \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books, Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events chronicles the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents' untimely death in a fire. A careless oversight initially places the children in the custody of a distant relative named Count Olaf, a mysterious and devious figure who is seeking fortune by way of stealing their inheritance. After his elaborate plans are foiled and his evil intentions are revealed, Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris) employs a variety of outlandish disguises to situate himself in the children's path, causing mayhem for the Baudelaire's and their subsequent guardians. \nAs the children manage to evade Count Olaf's scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they pick up clues along the way about their parents' past. The series is created by Daniel Handler (author of the Lemony Snicket series of books) and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld (Pushing Daisies, Men in Black, The Addams Family). Along with Harris, the series also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Malina Weissman (Violet), Louis Hynes (Klaus), Presley Smith (Sunny), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O'Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty), Don Johnson (Sir) and more. The series premieres January 13, 2017 on Netflix around the world. Related Links",

      "text": "\nThe Baudelaire children will find themselves facing off against the evil Count Olaf when Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres next year.\nDespite the fact that they’re on to him, a new trailer for the series proves that the Baudelaire kids will have their work cut out for them if they want to escape the clutches of their sinister new guardian unscathed.\nThe new teaser opens with Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes) and baby Sunny (Presley Smith) discovering that they’re orphans. Soon after that, they’re taken away to live with their new guardian.\nIt’s clear from the get-go, however that Count Olaf ( Neil Patrick Harris ) doesn’t have the kids’ best interests at heart.\n“We know you’re trying to steal our parents’ fortune,” says Klaus at one point.\nAs the trailer progresses, it also becomes clear that there’s quite a bit they didn’t know about their parents either, and unlocking the mystery could play a huge role in escaping Count Olaf’s clutches forever.\nOne thing is clear though: Count Olaf won’t be letting the Baudelaire kids go without a fight.\n“Wherever you go, I will hunt you down,” promises their evil guardian.\n \n\nNetflix’s adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. \n\nTagged: A Series Of Unfortunate Events , Neil Patrick Harris ",

      "text": "\nImgur / CrossedKeys\n\nMilly Bobby Brown is best known for playing Eleven, or ‘Elle’, on Netflix’s enormously successful Sci-Fi Thriller Stranger Things .\nIn the past six months, her career has gone from ‘virtually nonexistent’ to being considered one of the young actresses in Hollywood with the brightest futures. She’s been invited to appear on almost every single late night talk show in America where she’s proven to be a better rapper than Nicki Minaj , and in the end all of this has raised her level of fame to a point where it’s hard for her to go into public now without being recognized.\nEven though she’s already a successful actress after just one season on Stranger Things it’s important for Milly Bobby Brown to still have a childhood, and her bodyguard helped her be a kid recently at the Salt Lake City Comic-Con. At SLC-CC, Milly Bobby Brown put on a Guy Fawkes mask and went around the convention center in disguise with the protection of her bodyguard in case anything went wrong, but she mostly just took fun pics with strangers and got to be a kid for the day.\nMilly Bobby Brown’s bodyguard shared an album of photos from their adventure over on Imgur :\nView post on imgur.com View post on imgur.com \n\n\nView post on imgur.com View post on imgur.com \nView post on imgur.com \n\n\nView post on imgur.com \nShe did surprise a few people and tell them who she really is:\nView post on imgur.com View post on imgur.com \n\nYou can see the full set of photos HERE ON IMGUR if you want to keep on scrolling. All in all, I just find it refreshing that a young celeb with a bright future like her can sneak out into a Comic-Con and have fun just like a normal kid…As for why she was in Salt Lake City I haven’t the slightest clue.\nShare This\n",

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — After a bit of a tease, Netflix has released the full trailer for its forthcoming TV adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” full of Neil Patrick Harris in various forms of (debatably effective) disguise. Harris is the nefarious Count Olaf, antagonist to the three precocious Baudelaire children placed in his care after their parents are killed. As siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny attempt to escape the deadly schemes Olaf concocts to try and steal their parents’ fortune, they discover more about their parents’ wild past.\nParamount TV and Netflix began the adaptation process in 2014, a full decade after a movie franchise starring Jim Carrey as Olaf sputtered in 2004. The first season of Netflix’s show will cover four of the 13 novels in Daniel Handler’s book series — two episodes for each book.\nIn addition to Harris, Patrick Warburton plays narrator Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissman is Violet Baudelaire, and Louis Hynes is Klaus Baudelaire; Alfre Woodard, Joan Cusack and Aasif Mandvi take over various featured roles. The series is created by Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld of “Men in Black” and “The Addams Family” fame.\nThe first season of “A Series of Unfortunate Events” will premiere, appropriately enough, on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017.\nJustice Department blocks...",

      "text": "A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" will stay behind bars while state attorneys appeal a decision overturning his conviction, a panel of federal appellate judges ruled Thursday.\nBrendan Dassey's release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday.\n\"We are disappointed more than words can say,\" Dassey's attorneys, Steve Drizin and Laura Nirider, said in a statement posted online shortly after the ruling was released. \"The fight goes on.\"\nDassey, now 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. He confessed to detectives that he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate proceeding.\nJudge orders 'Making a Murderer' inmate Brendan Dassey released from prison A U.S. judge has ordered \"Making a Murderer\" inmate Brendan Dassey must be released from prison.

(Photo: Sue Pischke/AP | Video: CBS Miami)\nSee more videos Avery and Dassey contend they were framed by police angry with Avery for filing a lawsuit against the county over his wrongful imprisonment for a sexual assault he didn't commit. He's pursuing his own appeal in state court.\nTheir cases gained national attention last year after Netflix aired \"Making a Murderer,\" a multi-part documentary examining Halbach's death. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the documentary was biased but the series generated calls from the public to free both men.\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 years old at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and overturned his conviction. Duffin said in the decision that if state attorneys appealed the ruling Dassey would remain in prison pending a resolution.\nThe state Justice Department filed an appeal that is still working its way through the 7th Circuit. But this week Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday.\nJudge orders 'Making a Murderer' inmate Brendan Dassey released by Friday; state appeals Tribune news services A federal judge told Wisconsin prison officials on Wednesday that they must release an inmate featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" by Friday evening.\nIt's unclear if Brendan Dassey will finally walk free, however. Hours after U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin issued his release...\nA federal judge told Wisconsin prison officials on Wednesday that they must release an inmate featured in the Netflix series \"Making a Murderer\" by Friday evening.\nIt's unclear if Brendan Dassey will finally walk free, however. Hours after U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin issued his release...\n(Tribune news services) The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit on Wednesday seeking to block the release, arguing Duffin's release order contradicts his original ruling in which he said Dassey would remain in prison pending the appeal's resolution, Dassey's interrogators used techniques that courts around the country have repeatedly approved and Dassey presents a danger to society.\nDrizin and Nirider countered with a filing that argued Dassey has behaved in prison and the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release.\nThe 7th Circuit judges — Frank Easterbrook, Kenneth Ripple and David Hamilton, issued a two-page ruling Thursday saying only that the state's emergency motion was granted and Dassey will remain behind bars pending the outcome of the appeal.\nAssociated Press\nCopyright © 2016, Chicago Tribune U.S. Department of Justice",

      "title": "Gilmore Girls’ “la-las” are back: composer Sam Phillips on writing new music for the Netflix revival",
      "text": "share Netflix Singer-songwriter Sam Phillips had never worked on scores for film or television before she was hired to compose the music for Gilmore Girls in 2000, right after the show's pilot was picked up to series by the now-defunct WB network. Over the course of Gilmore Girls ’ (original) seven-season run, she developed music that became as much a part of the world of Stars Hollow as fast-paced dialogue and caffeine addictions . Since the showended in 2007, Phillips has also composed music for the late, great Bunheads , another show by Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino, and released two albums and five EPs. But when Netflix announced it would be reviving Gilmore Girls for a special four-episode miniseries titled Gilmore Girls: A Day in the Life , she couldn't wait to return. Related What you need to know about the Gilmore Girls revival on Netflix Vox spoke to Phillips earlier this year, just as she was preparing to pick up where she left off. Here’s what she had to say about molding the score into a character of its own, composing new music for the upcoming episodes, and which of Rory’s past boyfriends is the best. On thinking of Gilmore Girls ’ background music as one of the show’s characters: Phillips explained that Sherman-Palladino “wanted me to use my voice to do background vocals and make it sort of another character in Lorelei and Rory's heads.” Phillips says she thinks of the show’s melodies as “a little tune that you would sing in your head as you’re walking down the street,” and they definitely operate that way — good luck getting these songs out of your head: Phillips achieved this effect in part by keeping the production simple, without a lot of keyboards, drums, or bass guitar. \"A lot of times you don't hear a certain melody, you just hear a guitar strumming over and over again,\" she says. \"I would try to make these little mini melodies that would be connected to different characters or different emotions in the series.\" She recounted an instance from early in Gilmore Girls ’ run when she used a lot of strings in one scene and the result felt too dramatic. So she pared down the music to make it a better fit for the emotional moment. \"It's kind of the trial and error, trying to figure out what best supports the scene and what doesn't take away from it,\" she says. On how Gilmore Girls ’ score differed from the industry standard: When Gilmore Girls was airing on the WB, Warner Bros. Records was also involved. The music label would send over a lot of its music to Sherman-Palladino and Phillips, hoping the show could help it sell records. But Sherman-Palladino would resist most of the time, Phillips says, because she wanted to use songs that meant something to her. \"We tried to make the score different from most TV music to make it kind of odd, so that it was a little bit off-kilter and smaller,\" Phillips explains. She also says she appreciated the freedom she enjoyed while working on the show. Sherman-Palladino “always let me do what I thought was best, and she always pushed to do something very different musically,” Phillips says. “And I'm sure she took the heat, because I didn't hear a lot of comments; I didn't have any pressure from anyone.” On the power of pairing music with picture: Branching out of the corporate safe zone clearly worked. A quick skim of the comments section of any YouTube compilation of Phillips's classic \"la-las\" quickly reveals how much of an impact Gilmore Girls ’ music has had on people's lives.For example, many commenters have mentioned playing the show’s music during their weddings: YouTube Phillips maintains that “putting music to picture,” when done right, is “one of the more powerful mediums,” because you have writing, acting, visuals, and music all supporting each other. And the role of art, she says, is “to move us, to inspire us, and to mean something.” Gilmore Girls hit close to home for Phillips more than once. She had a 2-year-old daughter when she started working on the show, and she became a single mom over the course of its run. Phillips says she occasionally used to feel like the show’s writers were reading her mail, because the episodes “were so current with what I was going through.” Last year over the holidays, Phillips and her now 18-year-old daughter sat down to watch the entire series together for the first time. She says her daughter loved it, and that she’s excited to see how the new episodes are received by viewers who were too young for Gilmore Girls when it first aired but have since found an appreciation for the show. On the music she wrote for the new episodes: In short, keep an ear out for both familiar and new material. “Sitting down to write, I felt like it was so easy to compose the music just because I did it for so long and really got to know the characters and the series really well, so it came about very naturally,” Phillips says, noting that the music in the new episodes will be a little different but will call back to what Gilmore Girls fans have taken to calling “the la-las.” Phillips composed and performed the original score — complete with requisite la-las — for all four of the new episodes, providing vocals, acoustic guitar, and piano along with the rhythm section of Jay Bellerose (drums), Jennifer Condos (bass), and Eric Gorfain (guitars/keyboards). On the great debate over which of Rory's past boyfriends is the best: Phillips was quiet as she thought about this question for a minute, as it certainly isn’t an easy one to answer. The polarizing topic has been the subject of many an internet debate . Here’s her carefully considered response: \"I guess I have to say Jess, because it just seemed like there was such a spark there, you know? I mean, who doesn't love Dean because he was such a good guy, and Logan's very flashy, but I think I always loved Jess because he was a rebel.\" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Friday, November 25 , on Netflix.

      "text": "Factual Errors in Netflix's The Crown 14 Ways The Crown Gets the Royals Wrong November 17, 2016 by Marcia Moody 2 Shares \nAmbitiously lavish and costing a rumored $130 million to make , new Netflix drama The Crown has won fans around the world since the first 10 episodes dropped on No. 4. The jewels are painstaking replicas of the real thing, the filming locations include 10 stately homes around the UK, and there are over 20,000 costumes worn. But how much of what we see on screen is fact and how much benefits from a little sprinkling of showbiz fiction? The production has been scrupulously researched and much of what is depicted is true to life, but as with any great retelling, it also benefits from a little dramatic embellishment. In the opening scenes, we see King George VI coughing up blood into the toilet, but given the series opens in 1947 and the king wasn't diagnosed with lung cancer until four years later , it's unlikely he was exhibiting symptoms at this point. However, the king was in poor health for much of his later reign , so this is an effective device to depict that. At Princess Elizabeth's wedding , assorted floral displays are positioned around Westminster Abbey, whereas in real life, there were only two floral displays used — one either side of the altar — because of postwar austerity. Princess Elizabeth is portrayed as being very nervous on her wedding day, stumbling over her vows and needing to be prompted. However, a real-life letter from the king to his daughter afterward reads, \"You were so calm and composed during the service, and said your words with such conviction.\" Princess Elizabeth's and Prince Philip's wedding was attended by his mother, but although she is depicted in the show wearing a nun's habit, that is not how she attended in real life. She did wear her habit to the queen's coronation , however. Cine-camera footage marking the one-year anniversary of Princess Elizabeth's and Prince Philip's wedding is captioned, \"Twelve months later, eight months pregnant,\" when in reality, the princess celebrated her first wedding anniversary with a six-day-old Prince Charles. When King George had his lung removed, his anxious family is shown all gathered in the room next door, when in reality it was just his wife who was present . Queen Mary was at Marlborough House and visited afterward, Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip were at Clarence House and came in the evening, and Prince Charles and Princess Anne were in Scotland. When the king knows he is dying and calls for his daughter Elizabeth to sit with him as he works, she asks what paperwork is sent over by the government. However, it seems unlikely that at the age of 25 she wouldn't already know this. This is, after all, a young woman who has always been conscientious and aware and on her 21st birthday gave a speech where she showed a deep understanding of her future role. There is no record of Prince Philip making insensitive remarks to the Kenyan dignitaries he meets on his first royal tour. It's likely this is used as a way of portraying how he has become known over the years for making diplomatic faux pas. In the wake of the king's death, Princess Margaret's married lover, Peter Townsend, is cautioned by his senior about the affair, saying that everyone is talking about them. However, it was reported in the royal biography Snowdon that at that time, the affair was not common knowledge . A dramatic moment in the show comes courtesy of a letter written by Queen Mary to her granddaughter the new queen, advising her of her role and responsibilities. In real life, however, there was no such letter. Queen Mary did have a close relationship with her granddaughter though and had always taken a great interest in her royal development. When Prime Minister Winston Churchill advises the new queen to move from Clarence House to Buckingham Palace and retain the surname Windsor instead of her husband's Mountbatten, she resists. Later she seeks the counsel of her uncle the Duke of Windsor and changes her mind on both issues. The general consensus is that the queen is not likely to have sought his advice in this way . In the episode featuring the great fog, we're drawn into the intriguing relationship between Winston Churchill and his secretary, Venetia Scott, but in real life Venetia didn't exist . It's likely the government scenes could have come across as a little flat, and so a fictitious character was brought in to add more emotional depth to this part of the story. The great fog didn't create as much of a panic as was depicted either, because Londoners were used to thick fogs. A doctor who was alive at the time recently said, \" there was no sense of drama or emergency .\" The impact on mortality was only realized afterward, and there is no record it caused conflict between Churchill and the queen. One of the biggest plot points that has been refuted is Prince Philip's reticence to kneel before the queen at her coronation, as there is no record of it happening . Philip did struggle with his own life taking a back seat, but he came from royalty himself and understood how is worked as a concept, so it seems unlikely that he would have had a problem with this.",

Dassey will now have to remain in prison until the state's appeal of his overturned murder conviction, which was thrown out in August , is settled. Earlier this week, a judge officially ordered Dassey's release, which has been prolonged yet again.",

      "text": "Tweet \nIt's a bit strange to think about it, but back in 2004 Nickelodeon spent a ton of money making a big-screen adaptation of the beloved children's book franchise A Series of Unfortunate Events . It starred Jim Carrey as Count Olaf, a bitter and mysterious old man who becomes the guardian of three young children after their parents die in a fire -- and while audiences generally liked the film, it wasn't a major hit considering its surprising $140 million budget. But even though the film was warmly met, many could agree on one thing: it just wasn't quite like the books. \nIf you happened to be one of those fans, then brace yourself for the trailer for Netflix's new show version of A Series of Unfortunate Events . And even though this thing is going straight to streaming, don't think Netflix is pinching pennies here. The production design here looks every bit as elaborate and lush as the big budget version, if not moreso in parts. And this time it stars Neil Patrick Harris as Olaf, which is pretty much as perfect casting as you can get. \nCheck it out. \nNetflix will release their A Series of Unfortunate Events on January 13, 2017.

      "text": "\nThe Baudelaire children will find themselves facing off against the evil Count Olaf when Netflix’s A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres next year.\nDespite the fact that they’re on to him, a new trailer for the series proves that the Baudelaire kids will have their work cut out for them if they want to escape the clutches of their sinister new guardian unscathed.\nThe new teaser opens with Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes) and baby Sunny (Presley Smith) discovering that they’re orphans. Soon after that, they’re taken away to live with their new guardian.\nIt’s clear from the get-go, however that Count Olaf ( Neil Patrick Harris ) doesn’t have the kids’ best interests at heart.\n“We know you’re trying to steal our parents’ fortune,” says Klaus at one point.\nAs the trailer progresses, it also becomes clear that there’s quite a bit they didn’t know about their parents either, and unlocking the mystery could play a huge role in escaping Count Olaf’s clutches forever.\nOne thing is clear though: Count Olaf won’t be letting the Baudelaire kids go without a fight.\n“Wherever you go, I will hunt you down,” promises their evil guardian.\n \n\nNetflix’s adaptation of A Series of Unfortunate Events premieres Friday, Jan. 13, 2017. \n\nTagged: A Series Of Unfortunate Events , Neil Patrick Harris ",

      "text": "Amazon is doubling down on streaming video.\nThe Seattle tech giant is “on the verge of a massive global rollout” of its Prime streaming video service, The Wall Street Journal reported Thursday.\nThat aligns with what Jeremy Clarkson of Top Gear, which inked a massive deal with Amazon last year , tweeted on Wednesday in regard to his new show Grand Tour. Clarkson said the show, which streams exclusively on Amazon for Prime members, will be available in 200 territories. The streaming service is only available in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Austria, and Japan, with India — where Amazon plans to spend $300 million on original content — coming soon.\nSo. People of Ireland, Canada, Australia and pretty well everywhere else. You WILL be able to watch the Grand Tour. Amazon has gone global.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nIt's going to be available in 200 territories. That's pretty much everywhere.\n— Jeremy Clarkson (@JeremyClarkson) November 16, 2016 \nAmazon CEO Jeff Bezos, who doesn’t tweet much, sent out his own message on Twitter about the Grand Tour on Thursday. Bezos also noted that the show will be available “globally” in December.\nLong wait is over… Clarkson, Hammond, May are back… #TheGrandTour premieres tonight in UK, US, DE, JP. And globally in Dec. pic.twitter.com/dfQjGGuDFW \n— Jeff Bezos (@JeffBezos) November 17, 2016 \nIt’s not yet clear if other Amazon video content will also be available beyond the existing countries.\nStill, Amazon seems poised to further challenge industry leader Netflix, which is now available in more than 190 countries after a big expansion this past January .\nIn July, Amazon said it planned to double down on its spending for video content during the second half of 2016 compared to the same period last year. Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky added that the company will “nearly triple our offering to customers of new Amazon original TV shows and movies” compared to last year. \nOlsavsky talked about the video spend and increased costs again during last month’s earnings call after Amazon missed Wall Street’s expectations.\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that Amazon and Netflix have used different strategies for their original content, with Amazon focusing on regional original series’, and Netflix making shows for global audiences.\nAward-winning shows like “Transparent,” “Man in the High Castle,” and “Mozart in the Jungle” have helped Amazon Video quickly become a competitor in the video streaming space. The model was pioneered by Netflix, with original series like “House of Cards” and “Orange is the New Black.”\nThis year, Amazon was nominated for 16 Emmy Awards, up from 12 last year ; Netflix had 54 nominations, up 20 from last year, and good enough for third overall (HBO had 94 and FX had 58). Amazon ended up winning six awards on Sunday, while Netflix won nine.\nOriginally, Amazon’s original content was only available to annual Prime subscribers who pay $99 per year. In April, Amazon began offering a monthly $8.99 Prime subscription so members could access its video streaming service. The move was a direct swing at Netflix and its popular monthly subscription plan.\nIn his annual letter to shareholders , Bezos noted Amazon’s original shows, noting how they “feed the Prime flywheel.”\n“These shows are great for customers, and they feed the Prime flywheel – Prime members who watch Prime Video are more likely to convert from a free trial to a paid membership, and more likely to renew their annual subscriptions,” Bezos wrote.\nIn the shareholders letter, Bezos also noted that Prime is one of three pillars of success at Amazon, in addition to its e-commerce marketplace business and cloud computing platform, Amazon Web Services. Some say that Amazon’s video arm could ultimately become the company’s fourth pillar.\nThis past May, Amazon also announced a new service that competes with YouTube called Amazon Video Direct , a self-service option that lets content creators upload video for distribution through Amazon Prime Video or other methods, including ad-supported video, rental, purchase or subscription.",

      "text": "Spectral Legendary \nEXCLUSIVE : Netflix has acquired Spectral , the Legendary Pictures -produced action sci-fi film that stars James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood. Nic Mathieu directed it. Netflix has set it for a December 9 global release. A brilliant DARPA scientist embarks on a deadly mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers into a battle-scarred, war-torn city, where mysterious phantom aggressors code-named Spectral have been causing inexplicable civilian deaths. Ike Barinholtz Reunites With David Ayer & Will Smith On Netflix Film 'Bright' REX/Shutterstock \nThe film is based on a story by Ian Fried and Mathieu, and it was scripted by George Nolfi. Jillian Share produced it. The film was shot primarily on location in various streets and buildings in Budapest, Hungary, relying extensively on practical effects and locations for an authentic, gritty atmosphere firmly planted in reality. The film has a score by Junkie XL ( Batman V Superman and Deadpool ). The futuristic weapons were produced by Peter Jackson’s Weta Workshop and the VFX was done by Weta Digital, overseen by Oscar winners Joe Letteri and Erik Winquist.",

But let’s not think about that. \n7. Right, what do I want to watch?\n8. Hmmm, I feel like some sort of dark film. \n9. Psychological thriller, maybe.\n10. With creepy children who know things but the adults won’t listen to them. \n11. Let’s look in the thrillers category.\n12. Hmm, there isn’t a subcategory for disturbing mysteries with creepy kids. \n13. I guess it is kinda niche.\n\n14. Maybe just a general mystery/psychological thriller then. \n15. Seen that. Seen that. Seen that. \n16. Hated that. That looks shit. Fuck off, Adam Sandler. \n17. Ugh, I’ve already seen all of the perfect films.\n18. Maybe this is a good time for me to start Daredevil . \n19. Everyone says it’s good.\n20. … \n21. Na .\n22. Maybe one of those Scandinavian crime shows. \n23. Can I be bothered to read subtitles though?\n24. …\n\n25. Na .\n26. What about a good documentary? \n27. Yes, preferably dark and totally fucked-up.\n28. Hmmm, too sad. \n29. Too political.\n30. Too intellectual, cba to use my brain.\n\n31. Too fucked-up.\n32. This one is perfect. \n33. But I’m not in the right mood .\n34. Back to films. \n35. Hmmm, this looks promising.\n36. Let me check what it got on IMDB. \n37. 5.8? Oh, hell no.\n\n38. I operate on a 6.5 minimum. \n39. Wait, but it got 92% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n40. This is so confusing. \n41. Ooh this one got a 7.2 on IMDB and 91% on Rotten Tomatoes.\n\n42. Let me watch the trailer. \n43. …\n44. Na . \n45. There can’t be over a thousand things on here and yet fuck all to watch.\n46. I just need to pick something someone has recommended and force myself to watch it. \n47. How has it been an hour already?\n48. Oh my god, I’ll have to go to bed soon. \n49. Quickly, just pick something. Anything .\n50. OOOH let me check My List. \n51. Bound to be some good stuff on there I’ve been meaning to watch.\n52. Paul Blart: Mall Cop ? American Pie 3 ? \n53. Did I make this list when I was high?\n54. Oh wait, I think I actually did. \n55. Ugh, I’m really not in the mood to start Daredevil though.\n\n56. No time like the present, I guess. \n57. Hmmm, not feeling this.\n58. All incredible shows take time though. \n59. Like Breaking Bad .\n60. And The Wire . \n61. I mean, that took me 10 years to get into.\n62. I wish I could, like, know, for certain , that a show is worth the effort. \n63. What if I just end up wasting my entire evening on a bad show?\n64. Wait, how have two hours already passed? \n65. Paul Blart: Mall Cop it is.\n\n66. I really should have watched Daredevil . \nID: 9985656 Check out more articles on BuzzFeed.com! \nRemee Patel is a senior editor for BuzzFeed UK and is based in London.",

      "title": "These New 'Gilmore Girls' Revival Photos Give Fans A New Look At Richard's Grave â PHOTOS",
      "text": "By Michelle Lulic 3 hours ago \nGilmore Girls fans are just a week away from the Netflix revival, Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life . The closer we get to seeing our favorite women back in action, the more details we learn about our upcoming visit to Stars Hollow. Entertainment Weekly Â exclusively released five new photos from the Gilmore Girls revival . These latest sneak peaks show an all-too-familiar encounter with Taylor, Lorelai and Rory taking part in another crazy town event, some trips to Luke's Diner, and a heartbreaking visit to Richard Gilmore's grave. However, as per usual, there's so much more we can learn from these photos beyond that first glance. \nThere's no denying the fact that the Gilmore Girls revival is going to be packed with drama. Rory's back in town after a whirlwind journalism career, Jess' return is certainly worth noting, and Stars Hollow looks just as crazy as ever. However, theÂ lack of Richard Gilmore â following Edward Herrmann's 2014 passing â has been felt by all of us even as we get ourselves psyched up for the revival. From the looks of EW 's latest photo, there are still more ways that the show can break our hearts with the reminder that Richard is gone. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/EW/status/799323771320598528] \nThis photoÂ brings a couple of things into question. For one, how recently did Richard Gilmore pass away? The revival trailer shows a ceremony for Richard, butÂ his tombstone doesn't appear to read \"2016.\" Instead, it looks like it says Richard passed away in 2013, which means this pictureÂ could be showing aÂ different kind of remembranceÂ ceremony for Richard. This would also makeÂ Emily's period ofÂ grieving longer than I thought, so I'm alreadyÂ reaching for my tissues. \nIn another exclusive look, Lorelai and Rory appear to be having their own moment. While sitting in Luke's Diner, the two Gilmores appear to be lacking their signature cups of coffee and plates of pancakes. Instead, they areÂ listening intently to another character who isn't seen in the photo. This could be a sign of someÂ big, possibly shocking news. Could Luke be the one talking? I have so many questions. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/EW/status/799313677983879168] \nThe other photos EW revealed include familiar glimpses at a hippie-themed summer in town â clearly for another kooky town event âÂ and thatÂ intense meeting between Luke and Jess . But we also get to seeÂ an overly-excited lookingÂ Rory in the presence of the self-declared head of the town, Taylor Doose. It almost feels like no time has passed at all since we last left Stars Hollow. [Twitter Embed: https://twitter.com/GilmoreGirrls/status/799217547371548673] \nThe wait for more Gilmore Girls will officially end November 25, but, until then, these photos are testing my patience. \nImages:Â Saeed Adyani/Netflix ",

      "text": "Amazon’s biggest new show, The Grand Tour, premieres today, with the team formerly of the BBC’s Top Gear traveling in expensive cars around the world. It is rumored to cost a whopping £4.5 million ($5.6 million) a show—and Jeremy Clarkson is reportedly making $12.4 million a year to host.\nHe’s not the only streaming-video star taking home a hefty paycheck. The Hollywood Reporter notes that Amazon is paying Robert De Niro $750,000 for each of the 20 episodes of an upcoming series. Jonah Hill and Emma Stone will get $350,000 per episode to star in an upcoming Netflix show called Maniac. Back on premium cable, Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson makes $450,000 per episode on the HBO comedy Ballers. (HBO, it should be noted, is trying to be more like Netflix .)\nThese figures are insane, sure. Netflix, Amazon, and HBO are digging deep into their pockets to secure the best talent. HBO is expected to spend about $1.8 billion this year, 20% more than in 2015, while Netflix plans to spend a staggering $6 billion on content next year and Amazon has boosted its content budget too.\nBut these platforms also pay more for talent upfront, because actors and creators miss out on the ancillary income they would typically get from syndication—when a show is sold on to other networks. That has all changed with streaming. Netflix, in particular, has kept an iron grip on the global rights to most of its programming, rarely releasing it outside of the platform , which means actors don’t get their usual cut of other revenue streams that would have come down the road.\nAn example: the US sitcom Friends still makes about $1 billion a year in syndication revenue for Warner Bros. Each of the show’s core cast members—Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc, Matthew Perry, and David Schwimmer—takes home about 2% of that, which translates to roughly $20 million per year in syndication income. Each. And that’s for a show that ended 12 years ago.\nDe Niro’s flat fee of $15 million for 20 episodes at Amazon seems like a bargain in comparison.\nStreaming services like Netflix and Amazon account for that when they negotiate deals. Most of Netflix’s deals now have a flat “buy out,” according the Hollywood Reporter. “That’s why the checks are so big,” Netflix’s chief content officer Ted Sarandos reportedly said. “We are negotiating for what the backend would be.”\nThe same is true with films, an earlier Hollywood Reporter story showed. Few Netflix movies go to theaters and those that do are released online the same day, which limits the audience who will pay to see them in theaters. When Netflix is negotiating for the rights to films, it often buys out the cut that actors and creators would get from box-office profits, which is known as profit participation. Amazon offers a small, exclusive window for its theatrical releases, so it likely doesn’t have to buy out the profit participants.\nThis means that Netflix and Amazon’s deep pockets are driving up costs for everyone. Why would someone like De Niro wait for his $15 million when he can get it upfront and work with other A-list talent?",

      "text": "\nThis past summer Spectral was scheduled to open in theaters. If the movie wasn’t on your radar, that’s understandable. We’ve seen few promotional materials and the film never actually made it to theaters.\nThe sci-fi action movie pits James Badge Dale ( 13 Hours , pictured above) and Emily Mortimer ( Shutter Island ) against supernatural forces. Nic Mathieu ‘s 3D film has been described as Black Hawk Dawn with supernatural forces — an enticing mashup that Netflix, not Universal, will release next month.\nBelow, learn the Spectral release details.\n\nDeadline Netflix will release Spectral on December 9th . There’s zero mention of Universal or how or why the film has gone to the streaming service. But after the movie was removed from Universal’s release schedule, the move might not surprise some people. Mathieu shot Spectral over two years ago in Budapest, Hungary, and completed it over a year ago, so there’s also been a bit of a holdup on the project.\nIan Fried and Mathieu’s original story follows a DARPA scientist who goes on a near-suicide mission with a Special Ops team of Delta Force soldiers. They’ll have to fight in a war-torn European city, where supernatural forces are taking over and causing all sorts of chaos and carnage. Dale is presumably playing one of the Delta Force soldiers. The cast also includes Clayne Crawford ( Lethal Weapon TV series), Max Martini ( Pacific Rim ), Jimmy Skingbola ( Arrow ), and the great Bruce Greenwood ( Wildlike ).\nHere’s an image from the film:\n\nThere’s a good amount of talent involved in this project we’ve heard so little about. Besides that cast, the film features an original score from Junkie XL , composer behind Mad Max: Fury Road and Deadpool . He also worked on Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice with Hans Zimmer . Junkie XL has been composing some exciting, adrenaline-pumping music as of late, but it’s unclear what to expect from his score for Spectral , since, again, we’ve seen hardly anything from the delayed film.\nThe move from Universal to Netflix probably doesn’t raise anyone’s expectations for Spectral , but at least we’ll soon get to see some futuristic weapons produced by Weta Workshop. The VFX were handled by Weta Digital as well. Apparently, the film, which is co-written by screenwriter/director George Nolfi ( The Adjustment Bureau ), relies heavily on practical effects. We should expect to see more from Spectral soon.\nSpectral is available to stream on December 9th .\nThe post Legendary’s 3D Ghostbusting Action Movie ‘Spectral’ Goes to Netflix appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "Tweet \nThis week of November has brought a total of 28 new shows and movies to Netflix for their Canadian customers to sink their teeth into. 20 Movies, 2 Documentaries and 6 New TV series are all now streaming. As usual, we have chosen three interesting titles to highlight that we think you should check out from this week’s additions. \nOur first pick is the New Netflix Original Film ‘True Memoirs of an International Assassin’ Staring Kevin James who writes Spy novels, but his publishing company releases the book as nonfiction and after it becomes extremely popular and a best seller he attracts the attention of some very bad people. This Comedy, Action is not for everyone but if you just want to relax we would recommend it. \nSecond is series 1 of ‘Roman Empire: Reign of Blood’, also a relatively new Netflix Original based on the reign of Commodus and the beginning of the end for Rome and its Empire. If you are into the Spartacus series or any Roman Gladiator films, or just overall interested in Roman times as a whole then you will enjoy this title very much so. You can tell that many details have been researched and they are spot on. \nOur final pick is the awe-inspiring documentary mini-series ‘Tales by Light’. Which takes photographers from all around the world and delivers a unique and powerful story about the world from the perspective of individuals who really have a passion for this work. It’s also meant to inspire watchers to get out and see the world while they can and experience the incredible journeys that are possible on this planet. \nRead on for the full list of all 28 new releases: 20 New Movies Streaming to Netflix Canada \nOnve Upon a Holiday (2015) True Memoirs of an International Assasin (2016) Ms. Mayched (2016) Take me to the River (2015) The Innocents (2015)",

      "text": "This Network Won't Sell Content to Netflix Anymore \nBy Adam Levy \nFood Network stars Giada de Laurentiis and Bobby Flay. Image source: Scripps Networks Interactive. \nContinue Reading Below \nMedia companies have long complained about the impact of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) on their ratings and revenue. But on an individual basis, they're each caught in a prisoner's dilemma. If one doesn't license content to Netflix, but others do, the first one misses out on valuable licensing revenue and still takes a hit on ratings. \nNow, Scripps Networks (NASDAQ: SNI) is taking the first steps to cut off Netflix. On the company's third-quarter earnings call, COO Burton Jablin told anlaysts that Scripps \"made the strategic decision not to extend our SVOD [subscription video on demand] agreement with Netflix past the end of this year.\" Other networks, such as Time Warner (NYSE: TWX) , have discussed extending the window between first airing a show and licensing it, but never cutting off Netflix entirely. \nWhile Netflix has been more selective in what it licenses, a decline in its options could negatively affect its product. More From Fool.com He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick The reasoning behind Scripps' decision \nJablin was short on an explanation, other than saying it wasn't the best way to monetize its content in the long term. CEO Ken Lowe, however, expanded on Jablin's comments later in the call. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \n\"We have such compelling content for advertisers,\" Lowe told analysts, \"that we just don't want to really cut ourselves off from any opportunity.\" Scripps' networks include Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel, and DIY Network. \nThat comment makes it sound as if Netflix wanted an exclusive contract with Scripps. That's something it's been pushing for with most media companies it deals with. That ultimately led it to lose out on EPIX's content, which is now available on both Hulu and Amazon.com 's Prime. Scripps may be looking to forge similar non-exclusive licensing deals to maximize revenue. \nAdditionally, Lowe noted, \"We gained a lot of internal knowledge on the digital side and on the best way to monetize this content, including the further expansion and development of our digital sales team.\" That indicates that Scripps may look to improve the monetization of its own streaming content as well. \nThe loss of Netflix revenue will negatively impact distribution revenue, which accounted for about 28% of Scripps' total last quarter. Scripps' distribution revenue declined in the third quarter as the result of average rate declines caused by consolidation in the pay-TV industry, coupled with declines in subscribers. Going forward, management expects its distribution rates to climb at mid- to high-single-digit rates, but is still factoring in 1% to 2% in subscriber losses. Will Netflix see more dropouts? \nNetflix is pushing out more and more of its own original content to draw in new subscribers, but it's still heavily reliant on licensed content to provide value to its 86 million members. Netflix doesn't disclose how much it spends on original content, but it ultimately wants to move toward a 50/50 split in original content and licensed deals. (It's unclear if that's in spending or hours of content available.) \nNetflix's licensing deals are focused on brands and content that provide differentiation. But that's exactly the kind of content that's in the best position to stop licensing to Netflix and search for better monetization opportunities. \nTime Warner has some of the most differentiated content in the market, which enabled it to sell HBO as a stand-alone service and sell older HBO content to Amazon. It's also considering extending the exclusivity window for its other cable networks before licensing to SVOD services. And if it falls under the control of a traditional pay-TV distributor, it could cut off Netflix altogether, especially considering its 10% stake in Hulu. \nIf more networks follow the trend -- refusing Netflix exclusivity, or refusing Netflix's deals altogether -- it could result in higher churn rates for Netflix, as the value of its content library is heavily reliant on licensed content. Scripps could be just the first of many. The good news is that Netflix seems capable of producing extremely compelling originals and could ramp up more productions if need be. \n10 stocks we like better than Scripps Networks Interactive When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "text": "The biggest tech stocks have been suffering since the surprise election of Donald Trump as president. Shares of Apple and Alphabet have lost 2%, Facebook and Amazon 4%, and Netflix 7% since last week.\nAt the same time, the overall market has rallied with the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index gaining 5%.\nNow some analysts who follow the tech industry are arguing that the sell-off is overdone and big tech company stocks are bargains.\n“Concerns of President-Elect Trump’s impact on tech companies (are) being largely extrapolated from sound bites that are unlikely to manifest during Trump’s presidency,” Gene Munster, an analyst at Piper Jaffray pointed out in a report on Thursday. “Valuations are very attractive for each of the mega-caps, which have sold off despite any clear political reason.”\nMunster recommended that investors buy shares of five companies: Apple, Alphabet, Facebook, Amazon amzn , and Netflix nflx .\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter.\nThe prior Trump rhetoric that has scared some investors includes his threats to investigate Amazon for antitrust violations, a call to boycott Apple for not helping the FBI, and accusing Alphabet’s Google of helping rig the election . Expectations that Trump could gut net neutrality rules have hurt Netflix. More generally, Trump’s opposition to current policies on immigration, offshore manufacturing, and free trade could also hurt the big tech companies that have benefitted from those same policies.\nBut a more realistic assessment, at least according to Scott Kessler, an analyst at CFRA Research, indicates that the policies Trump is most likely to pursue in the areas of regulation, taxes, and trade could favor tech companies.\n“We see a stronger U.S. economy and less regulation as good for bigger technology companies,” Kessler wrote in Nov. 15 report. “In particular, we think easing or eliminating net neutrality would favor the biggest and best-capitalized companies able to most easily pay for faster and better access, and provide competitive advantages. We also believe certain technology companies could actually be aided by Trump’s focus on smarter trade deals and practices.”\nKessler recommended shares of Alphabet goog , Apple aapl , Facebook fb , and Intel intc .\nHowever, technology analysts are hardly experts on politics and have no special insight into which policies the incoming Trump administration will actually pursue. Investors should weigh even a small risk of a trade war or new tariffs on products made in China because either outcome would crush many tech stocks. So the recommendations to buy beaten down tech stocks could turn out to be just as misguided as the reports from finance sector analysts to buy sagging shares of banks and insurance companies in 2007.\nTo learn about sectors seen as benefitting from Trump, watch:\nOne piece of the tech proponents case seems especially weak. Both Kessler and Munster mention that Trump is likely to lower the tax on bringing untaxed foreign earnings back into the United States. Major tech companies have the most cash “trapped” overseas amid some $1.3 trillion overall.\nBut the tech companies have already found ways around the repatriation tax, by issuing debt against the cash hoards and by using the money to fund takeovers of foreign companies. Studies of the last tax break for overseas cash found that most of the money was used in unproductive ways that did not bolster the economy much.\nSo while it may be true that irrational fears of a Trump presidency have hurt tech stock prices, it doesn’t necessarily follow that the stocks will be top performers in the future.",

      "title": "‘Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events’ Trailer Released Today: Netflix Is At It Again",
      "text": "\nWell, it looks like Netflix is at it again, crafting another sure-fire hit for its in-house studio and releasing the first Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events trailer online today. This is of course, an adaptation of the beloved series of books simply titled, A Series of Unfortunate Events , written by Lemony Snicket, the pen name of American author, Daniel Handler.\nThe 13-book series follows the lives of Klaus, Violet, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents perish in a fire. They are placed in the care of Count Olaf, here played by Neil Patrick Harris, who seeks to steal the enormous fortune that Violet is set to inherit when she turns 18. Through the course of the books, the three children are subjected to numerous schemes by Count Olaf to swindle them out of their inheritance, from a marriage plot concealed in a play rehearsal, to being almost taken away to deepest darkest Peru. Of course, the children are smart enough and brave enough to outwit Olaf in each of his attempts. Along the way, the children discover that their parents were involved in a secret organization, called V.F.D., which of course intertwines with Count Olaf and virtually everyone else they run into.\nWhile the book series ends leaving many questions about certain characters unanswered, it’s unclear how much the series will pull from the books and how much will be fudged. And when we say fudged, we mean rewritten, of course, because Daniel Handler, the author, is serving as one of the Executive Producers.\nThe Netflix series has gained a lot of anticipation since its announcement in 2014. The anticipation only grew when it was announced in January, 2016, that Neil Patrick Harris cast as Count Olaf. People agreed that his acting style was a near-perfect fit for Count Olaf’s manic energy. The series wrapped filming in August, 2016, with stars taking to Instagram to celebrate.\nThanks @nph !!!! Can't believe this adventure is coming to an end (until season 2…..?) #asoue #netflix \nA photo posted by Chloe (@chlostess_withthe_mostest) on Aug 5, 2016 at 2:59pm PDT \n\nNo matter what you think of the books, certainly one of the best parts of the upcoming series will be seeing how Neil Patrick Harris looks in each of Count Olaf’s many disguises. The trailer shows us Shirley T. Sinoit-Pecer, a receptionist for an optometrist. (Spoiler: T. Sinoit-Pecer is receptionist spelled backwards). There are also shots of Olaf as Stephano (the bald fellow with the full beard), Captain Julio Sham (the sea captain with the eye patch), and Detective Dupin (the guy with the glasses and scarf) in turn. With Neil Patrick Harris’ comedic chops, the series should be a lot of fun.\nNeil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf as Shirley T. Sinoit-Pécer in Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events . [Image by Netflix] The trailer also showcases many stars who are lending their names to this project, showing just how much Netflix’s stock in Hollywood has grown in the past decade. Patrick Warburton stars as the titular narrator, Lemony Snicket, with newcomers Malina Weissman starring as Violet, and Louis Hynes co-starring as Klaus. Other notables include Joan Cusack as Justice Strauss, K. Todd Freeman as Mr. Poe, and Alfre Woodard as Aunt Josephine.\nThis isn’t the first time the books have been translated for visual media. The 2004 film based on the same property was also titled, Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events. It was widely praised and even won the Academy Award for best makeup. In that film, Count Olaf was played by Jim Carrey, and Lemony Snicket was played by Jude Law. Despite the film’s modest success, no sequel was ever made, opening up the doors for this adaptation.\nThe full trailer can be watched below:\nNetflix’s Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events first season will be released in its entirety on Friday, January 13, 2017, so you have all weekend to binge watch it with your children.\n[Featured Image by Netflix]\n‘Lemony Snicket’s A Series Of Unfortunate Events’ Trailer Released Today: Netflix Is At It Again is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, Netflix's Gilmore Girls revival drops Nov. 25, and early, spoiler-free reviews started rolling in on Wednesday. The four 90-minute episodes reunite creator Amy Sherman-Palladino with her beloved town of Stars Hollow, and are a much more fitting send-off to the series than 2007's Sherman-Palladino-less seventh season.\nThe critical consensus on Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life so far is that it's kind of messy but mostly very good, and the flaws don't overshadow how pleasant it is to have Gilmore Girls back and true to its legacy of quality.\nThere have been an exhausting number of reboots and revivals on television in the last few years, and most of them were superfluous, but all reviewers agree (with relief) that Gilmore Girls feels like it has a reason to exist.\nThe Gilmore Girls revival isn't just for fans of the original series\n\"It's the first reunion project in a long time to not make me regret the existence of it,\" writes Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall , who has problems with A Year In the Life 's timeline, noting that the way time passes on the show is confusing and imprecise.\nThe Hollywood Reporter 's Daniel Fienberg has the same issue, writing: \"Time has passed in the world of the show, but you can tell Sherman-Palladino wishes it hadn't. It's better if you pretend that Rory is still in her mid-20s, that you assume that each and every character dynamic is intact and consistent, that you don't dwell on which pop culture references are current and which have been in Sherman-Palladino's back pocket for years. (And, time-wise, don't get me started on asking viewers to pretend that Paul Anka, the Gilmore dog, is both the same dog-character and the same dog-actor as when we left off. That's probably the nadir of the miniseries' chrono-denying.)\"\nOther critics don't like the third episode's musical number, which USA Today 's Robert Bianco says \"defies belief.\"\nBut, as the Washington Post 's Emily Yahr puts it, none of the flaws should matter much to fans, \"because Gilmore Girls is back.\"\nVariety 's Maureen Ryan writes: \"The Gilmore Girls we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring.\"\nAll critics have praised the revival's writing. \"Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears,\" writes Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen .\nAdds TVLine's Michael Ausiello : \"The quip-per-minute ratio hits an all-time high in the revival.\nIt must be noted that Ausiello is a Gilmore Girls superfan with a cameo in A Year In the Life. His review is glowing, and his only criticism is that the musical is about two minutes too long. He praises Lauren Graham in particular, writing that she \"turns in the performance of her career.\"\nAll in all, it sounds like Gilmore Girls fans can rest assured that settling in to watch the revival will be like sitting down with an old friend over coffee.\nTVGuide.com's review of Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life is coming later this week.\nGilmore Girls: A Year In the Life arrives on Netflix Friday, Nov. 25.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nGilmore Girls Lauren Graham Alexis Bledel Amy Sherman-Palladino\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "Netflix's A Series of Unfortunate Events Reveals Two New Character Photos Megan Peters Start Photo Gallery Back to Article Image of \nFor fans of A Series of Unfortunate Events , Netflix has given them a rather fortunate gift. The site rolled out its first full-length trailer for the adapted series earlier today which shows Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf. The trailer gives fans a look into other characters like Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. \nAnd, now, fans can look at the two characters even more closely through two character photos. \nThe images were posted to Twitter by Daniel Handler, and they show several key elements of the characters. For Justice Strauss, fans can see the lady reading a book about adoption law in his massive library which the Baudelaire children come to adore. And, for Dr. Orwell, fans can see her iconic lab coat and snippy glasses propped on her prime nose. \nIf you are not familiar with the characters, then you should know the women fight on opposite sides when it comes to the Baudelaire orphans. Justice Strauss acts as the children’s champion and even tries to adopt them after foiling Count Olaf’s scheme to steal their inheritance. As for Dr. Orwell, the doctor-turned-hypnotist sides with Count Olaf and stands to split the Baudelaire’s riches with the persnickety man should they steal it. \nFans first learned that A Series of Unfortunate Events would be coming to Netflix in association with Paramount Television last year. In July, a video titled “An Unfortunate Teaser” was posted to Youtube which teased the show, but Netflix claimed the trailer was fan-made though many are skeptical about that claim. \nLater in the year, Barry Sonnenfeld and Mark Hudis were tapped to helm the series. Neil Patrick Harris was cast to play Count Olaf while Malina Weissman and Louis Hynes signed on to play Violet and Klaus Baudelaire. \nThis spring, K. Todd Freeman was cast as Mr. Poe and Patrick Warbuton agreed to portray Lemony Snicket himself. Production went underway in March, and filming recently wrapped in August. \nThis isn’t the first time A Series of Unfortunate Events has hit the screen. In 2004, director Brad Silberling released a live-action film based on the novel featuring Jim Carrey, Emily Browning, and Jude Law. \nA first look at Justice Strauss and Dr. Orwell. Later this week, the @Unfortunate trailer. pic.twitter.com/8ynBSs6Y52 — Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) November 14, 2016 \nBased on the internationally best-selling series of books by Lemony Snicket (aka Daniel Handler) and starring Emmy and Tony Award winner Neil Patrick Harris, A Series of Unfortunate Events recounts the tragic tale of the Baudelaire orphans -- Violet, Klaus, and Sunny – whose evil guardian Count Olaf will stop at nothing to get his hands on their inheritance. The siblings must outsmart Olaf at every turn, foiling his many devious plans and disguises, in order to discover clues to their parents’ mysterious death. The eight-episode series is a Netflix original production, executive produced by Emmy Award winner Barry Sonnenfeld and Daniel Handler, and premieres January 13, 2017 only on Netflix. \nLemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events will premiere on January 13, 2017.",

      "text": "After so many teases, Netflix has released the first full-length trailer for its adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events books. After their parents perish—that means “killed,” by the way—in a fire, the Baudelaire orphans are sent to live with a guardian who seems to be out only for their fortune. Whereas previous teasers focused on Neil Patrick Harris’ nefarious Count Olaf, here we meet a bevy of colorful characters inhabiting Snicket’s world—including Olaf as Captain Julio Sham, Olaf as herpetologist Stephano, Olaf as receptionist Shirley T. Sinoit-Pécer… Suffice to say, it looks like Olaf’s many disguises are on display. But there’s also plenty of mystery and super secret organizations!\n\nIt’s safe to guess that the Netflix series will adapt several of Snicket’s books, as we see Violet, Klaus, and baby Sunny try to outsmart Olaf—not difficult, considering the bit with the hourglass—and discover the truth behind their parents’ lives before the fire. In doing so, they stumble upon detailed maps, coded messages in old movies, and The Incomplete History of Secret Organizations ! Plus, plenty of friends and foes:\n\nAll eight episodes of A Series of Unfortunate Events drop at once on Friday, January 13.\nShare: Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window) Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window) Click to share on Tumblr (Opens in new window) Click to share on Google+ (Opens in new window) Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)",

      "text": "Thursday, November 17, 2016, 8:00 PM \nDevious, a word which here might mean delightfully sordid and altogether awful. \nNetflix released the first full-length trailer for Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events” Thursday and the Baudelaire children are exactly as dispirited as expected. Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris) is out to steal a fortune in Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events.” (Netflix) \nThe two-and-a-half minute trailer, which starts cheery, quickly turns terrifying as County Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris) takes every measure imaginable to steal the fortune from orphans Violet (Malina Weissman), Klaus (Louis Hynes) and Sunny (Presley Smith). \n“Wherever you go, I will hunt you down,” the children’s new guardian threatens as he dons countless disguises. The Baudelaire orphans don’t know what they’re in for yet. (Netflix) \nPatrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O’Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Mandvi (Uncle Monty) and Don Johnson (Sir) also star in the eight-episode series. \n“A Series of Unfortunate Events” premieres on Netflix on Jan. 13.

      "text": "Nov 17, 2016 \nNBC \nIt’s almost Thanksgiving which means it’s time to eat your body weight in marshmallow-covered sweet potatoes and veg out on the couch watching as much TV as possible. How lucky are we to live in a world where Netflix makes this truly possible. If there’s anything we’re thankful for, it’s how Netflix has changed lazy, holiday weekends forever. \nIf you want to get into the holiday spirit, the kick-ass streaming service has some of our all-time favorite Thanksgiving episodes from our most beloved sitcoms. Whether you want to eat a tofurky with Jess from New Girl (that’s something she’d do right?) or engage in a little Slapsiving with the How I Met Your Mother crew, Netflix has got you covered. GIPHY \nWatch: Season 5, Episode 8, “The One With All The Thanksgivings” \nWhy: A Thanksgiving must-watch list without Friends is like a Thanksgiving dinner without turkey. Though Friends has a whole bunch of worthy Thanksgiving-themed episodes, “The One With All The Thanksgivings” is pleasantly sentimental. Each character tells a story about a horrible Thanksgiving of their past, complete with flashbacks to the ’80s and Chandler’s Flock of Seagulls haircut. It’s also the infamous episode where Joey gets a turkey stuck on his head. \nAlso recommended: \nSeason 1, Episode 9, “The One Where Underdog Gets Away” \nSeason 2, Episode 8, “The One With the List” \nSeason 3, Episode 9, “The One With the Football” \nSeason 4, Episode 9, “The One With Chandler in a Box” \nSeason 6, Episode 9, “The One Where Ross Got High” \nSeason 7, Episode 8, “The One Where Chandler Doesn’t Like Dogs” \nSeason 8, Episode 9, “The One With the Rumor” \nSeason 9, Episode 8, “The One With Rachel’s Other Sister” \nSeason 10, Episode 8, “The One With the Late Thanksgiving” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 3, Episode 9, “Slapsgiving \nWhy: Following in the footsteps of Friends , How I Met You Mother has a long-standing tradition of amazing, Thanksgiving-themed episodes. While all of the Thanksgiving episodes in the series’ nine-season run are worth a watch, “Slapsgiving” is probably the most classic. It’s Marshall and Lily’s first Thanksgiving as a married couple, it’s the first time we get to see Robin and Ted’s major salute, and it marks the end of Marshall and Barney’s long-running slap bet. \nAlso recommended: \nSeason 1, Episode 9, “Belly Full of Turkey” \nSeason 5, Episode 9, “Slapsgiving 2: Revenge of the Slap” \nSeason 6, Episode 10, “Blitzgiving” \nSeason 7, Episode 11, “The Rebound Girl” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 3, Episode 9, “A Deep-Fried Korean Thanksgiving” \nWhy: Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life doesn’t come out until the 25th, so if you need some of your favorite mother-daughter duo in your life before the big day, now is the perfect time to reminisce over a Thanksgiving episode. In this episode, Lorelai and Rory try to go to four separate Thanksgiving dinners and hilarity ensues. \nAlso recommended: Season 6, Episode 10, “He’s Slippin ‘Em Bread…Dig?” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 3, Episode 5, “An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal \nWhy: There’s nothing better to zone out to on a stomach full of pumpkin pie than Bob’s Burgers. The lighthearted show is consistently funny, but this Thanksgiving episode is surprisingly sentimental. In this episode, Bob is super excited about a three-day brine recipe, but someone keeps throwing his turkey in the toilet. Each time it happens, Bob buys another Turkey, determined to have the best Thanksgiving ever. It’s a game of who-done-it with a pretty good twist. There are also some sweet father-daughter moments between Tina and Bob. \nAlso recommended: \nSeason 3, Episode 5: “An Indecent Thanksgiving Proposal” \nSeason 4, Episode 5: “Turkey in a Can” \nSeason 5, Episode 4: “Dawn of the Peck” \nSeason 6, Episode 4: “Gayle Makin’ Bob Sled” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 2, Episode 8, “Parents” \nWhy: In this quirky episode of New Girl, Jess’ parents Bob and Joan show up at the same time for Thanksgiving dinner. Jess tries to “parent trap” the couple, but it totally backfires. This emotional story is coupled with Schmidt and his ex-Marine cousin Big Schmidt battling over who is the most manly. \nAlso recommended: \nSeason 1, Episode 6, “Thanksgiving” \nSeason 3, Episode 10, “Thanksgiving III” \nSeason 4, Episode 9, “Thanksgiving IV” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 4, Episode 8, “Thanksgiving” \nWhy: The whole Glee gang is reunited when they come home for Thanksgiving, but not everyone is pleased at the up-and-comers who have filled their spots in the glee club. You can’t beat Glee’s festive sing-alongs, though. GIPHY \nWatch: Season 2, Episode 10, “Happy Thanksgiving” \nWhy: The Bravermans are all together in this drama-filled episode of Parenthood. Adam is torn between his job and his family, Julia loses it while making pies for dinner, Camille and Amber share a very special moment. This episode is everything we love about Parenthood. It’s sweet, sentimental, and totally real. GIPHY \nWatch: Season 1, Episode 9, “Blair Waldorf Must Pie!” \nWhy: This episode really shows Blair in a different light and adds a whole bunch of depth to her character. She’s painted as a mean girl throughout the series, but “Blair Waldorf Must Pie!” is the first glimpse at the misery and insecurity that makes her that way. After being crushed that her father isn’t joining her for Thanksgiving, it is revealed that Blair has bulimia and relapses. We also find out how Dan met Serena for the first time. \nAlso recommended: \nSeason 2, episode 11, “The Magnificent Archibalds” \nSeason 3, Episode 11, “The Treasure of Serena Madre” \nSeason 4, Episode 10, “Gaslit” \nSeason 6, Episode 8, “It’s Really Complicated” GIPHY \nWatch: Season 2, Episode 4, “It’s A Miracle” \nWhy: The short-lived sitcom Don’t Trust The B—– In Apartment 23 is seriously overlooked. It’s hysterical, heartfelt and ended way, way too soon. In this episode, June can’t afford to fly to home for Thanksgiving so stone-cold Chloe invites her to her parents’ celebration. Somehow, Chloe gets June to pretend to be in a wheelchair and some awkwardness ensues because of June’s previous encounter with Chloe’s dad. GIPHY \nWatch: Season 3, Episode 8, “Thanksgiving” \nWhy: Thanksgiving is nothing without football which is why The League’s Turkey Day episode is a must-watch. In this episode, Ruxin gets a surprise visit from his dad, and Andre’s sister (played by guest star Sarah Silverman ) is on the prowl. The football jargon-level of this episode is pretty on par with whatever you’re hearing from the game on in the background of Thanksgiving dinner, so if you’re not a sports fan, you can still enjoy. \nWhat’s your favorite Thanksgiving special?

      "text": "LOS ANGELES — After a bit of a tease, Netflix has released the full trailer for its forthcoming TV adaptation of Lemony Snicket’s “A Series of Unfortunate Events,” full of Neil Patrick Harris in various forms of (debatably effective) disguise. Harris is the nefarious Count Olaf, antagonist to the three precocious Baudelaire children placed in his care after their parents are killed. As siblings Violet, Klaus and Sunny attempt to escape the deadly schemes Olaf concocts to try and steal their parents’ fortune, they discover more about their parents’ wild past.\nParamount TV and Netflix began the adaptation process in 2014, a full decade after a movie franchise starring Jim Carrey as Olaf sputtered in 2004. The first season of Netflix’s show will cover four of the 13 novels in Daniel Handler’s book series — two episodes for each book.\nIn addition to Harris, Patrick Warburton plays narrator Lemony Snicket, Malina Weissman is Violet Baudelaire, and Louis Hynes is Klaus Baudelaire; Alfre Woodard, Joan Cusack and Aasif Mandvi take over various featured roles. The series is created by Handler and executive produced by Handler and Emmy winner Barry Sonnenfeld of “Men in Black” and “The Addams Family” fame.\nThe first season of “A Series of Unfortunate Events” will premiere, appropriately enough, on Friday, Jan. 13, 2017.\nThis week’s 5 best bets for...

PHOTO: REUTERS Nov 18, 2016 7:18 AM \n[LOS ANGELES] Amazon.com Inc is preparing to take its video streaming service worldwide in a challenge to Netflix Inc, the world's largest online TV network. \nThe world's biggest online retailer, which currently offers its video service in only a handful countries, announced the plans Thursday in a blog post about The Grand Tour , a lavish new reality show featuring the former stars of BBC's popular Top Gear . \n\"In December, the show will premiere in 200 countries and territories around the world, exclusively on Amazon,\" the company wrote on its website. Chief Executive Officer Jeff Bezos also mentioned the plans on Twitter. \nThe move marks the biggest challenge yet for Netflix, which now operates in about 190 countries completing its international rollout. Amazon, based in Seattle, has spent billions of dollars licensing programming and producing original TV shows and movies as part of its Prime service. \nCustomers who pay U$99 a year for free shipping and other benefits get access to a library of new and older programming at no additional cost. \nSally Fouts, an Amazon spokeswoman, declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Amazon's plans earlier Thursday. \nBLOOMBERG ",

There’s some top tier talent too behind-the-scenes starting with George Nolfi (“The Bourne Ultimatum”) penned the script from a story by Ian Fried and Mathieu. \nThomas Tull, Jon Jashni and Jillian Share produced, Junkie XL (“Mad Max: Fury Road”) did the score and WETA provided the weapons and digital effects. No word on when the film will hit the streaming service. \nSource: Netflix",

      "text": "November 17, 2016 at 3:15 pm | UPDATED: November 17, 2016 at 6:50 pm \nIt’s finally here! The trailer for Netflix’s “Lemony Snicket’s A Series of Unfortunate Events” has been released and is full of wonderful — and weird — imagery. The saga chronicles the turbulent lives of Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire after their parents’ untimely death in a fire. \nA careless oversight initially places the children in the custody of a distant relative named Count Olaf, a mysterious and devious figure who is seeking fortune by way of stealing their inheritance. After his elaborate plans are foiled and his evil intentions are revealed, Count Olaf (Neil Patrick Harris) employs a variety of outlandish disguises to situate himself in the children’s path, causing mayhem for the Baudelaire’s and their subsequent guardians. \nAs the children manage to evade Count Olaf’s scheming attempts to steal their fortune, they pick up clues along the way about their parents’ past. The series is created by Daniel Handler (author of the Lemony Snicket series of books). Along with Harris, the series also stars Patrick Warburton (Lemony Snicket), Malina Weissman (Violet), Louis Hynes (Klaus), Presley Smith (Sunny), Joan Cusack (Justice Strauss), Alfre Woodard (Aunt Josephine), Catherine O’Hara (Dr. Orwell), K. Todd Freeman (Mr. Poe), Aasif Maandvi (Uncle Monty), Don Johnson (Sir) and more. \nThe series premieres Jan. 13, 2017 on Netflix. ",

      "text": "By Liam Mathews, Netflix's Gilmore Girls revival drops Nov. 25, and early, spoiler-free reviews started rolling in on Wednesday. The four 90-minute episodes reunite creator Amy Sherman-Palladino with her beloved town of Stars Hollow, and are a much more fitting send-off to the series than 2007's Sherman-Palladino-less seventh season.\nThe critical consensus on Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life so far is that it's kind of messy but mostly very good, and the flaws don't overshadow how pleasant it is to have Gilmore Girls back and true to its legacy of quality.\nThere have been an exhausting number of reboots and revivals on television in the last few years, and most of them were superfluous, but all reviewers agree (with relief) that Gilmore Girls feels like it has a reason to exist.\nThe Gilmore Girls revival isn't just for fans of the original series\n\"It's the first reunion project in a long time to not make me regret the existence of it,\" writes Uproxx's Alan Sepinwall , who has problems with A Year In the Life 's timeline, noting that the way time passes on the show is confusing and imprecise.\nThe Hollywood Reporter 's Daniel Fienberg has the same issue, writing: \"Time has passed in the world of the show, but you can tell Sherman-Palladino wishes it hadn't. It's better if you pretend that Rory is still in her mid-20s, that you assume that each and every character dynamic is intact and consistent, that you don't dwell on which pop culture references are current and which have been in Sherman-Palladino's back pocket for years. (And, time-wise, don't get me started on asking viewers to pretend that Paul Anka, the Gilmore dog, is both the same dog-character and the same dog-actor as when we left off. That's probably the nadir of the miniseries' chrono-denying.)\"\nOther critics don't like the third episode's musical number, which USA Today 's Robert Bianco says \"defies belief.\"\nBut, as the Washington Post 's Emily Yahr puts it, none of the flaws should matter much to fans, \"because Gilmore Girls is back.\"\nVariety 's Maureen Ryan writes: \"The Gilmore Girls we knew and loved is back, and at its best, it's the equivalent of a platter of powdered donuts and extra-crispy french fries. Maybe it's a little too much at times -- and rapid consumption of the four 90-minute episodes Netflix commissioned is not advised -- but when it relies on the notable strengths of its core ensemble, it is television at its most warm and reassuring.\"\nAll critics have praised the revival's writing. \"Listening to the rhythm, lilt, and inspired language of their dialogue is music to the ears,\" writes Entertainment Weekly 's Jeff Jensen .\nAdds TVLine's Michael Ausiello : \"The quip-per-minute ratio hits an all-time high in the revival.\nIt must be noted that Ausiello is a Gilmore Girls superfan with a cameo in A Year In the Life. His review is glowing, and his only criticism is that the musical is about two minutes too long. He praises Lauren Graham in particular, writing that she \"turns in the performance of her career.\"\nAll in all, it sounds like Gilmore Girls fans can rest assured that settling in to watch the revival will be like sitting down with an old friend over coffee.\nTVGuide.com's review of Gilmore Girls: A Year In the Life is coming later this week.\nGilmore Girls: A Year In the Life arrives on Netflix Friday, Nov. 25.\nOther Links From TVGuide.com\nGilmore Girls Lauren Graham Alexis Bledel Amy Sherman-Palladino\nView the original article on TVGuide.com",

      "text": "disney Share this article \nLet’s all give a moment of thanks to Netflix for consistently saturating my life with solid throwback movies that distract my overworked mind with childhood memories. As the craze of the 2016 presidential election hit its peak, Netflix threw it back with one of my favorites: The Lizzie McGuire Movie. As both Hillary Clinton and Hilary Duff trended on all my social media, I decided to mix the two and take a look at this election season as told through Lizzie McGuire: \nWhen Hillary Clinton announced her campaign like \n\nEvery time Donald Trump said something sexist, racist, or just plain awful \n\n\nTrying to explain to that conservative relative that your liberal views aren’t “just a millennial phase” \n\n\nGoing to the polling place to cast my vote for possibly the first female president this country has seen \n\nWatching the results come in throughout Tuesday night showing Trump’s lead and being in complete denial… \n\n...and finally realizing that he could actually win the presidency... \n\n...and the rough few days that followed \n\n\nMy face whenever I see a social media post calling those upset by the results “dramatic” \n\nWhen, despite how horrified I am with the results, I think about how far women have come in this country and how amazing it is to have almost had a female president \n\nAnd remember: There’s always 2020",

      "text": "Release of inmate featured on Netflix series blocked on appeal By The Associated Press | Thursday, Nov. 17, 2016, 10:51 p.m. Email Newsletters \nSign up for one of our email newsletters. Updated 46 minutes ago MADISON, Wis. — A Wisconsin prison inmate whose case was featured in the Netflix series “Making a Murderer” will stay behind bars while state attorneys appeal a decision overturning his conviction, a panel of federal appellate judges ruled Thursday. Brendan Dassey's release from prison appeared imminent right up until the three-judge panel from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago issued its decision. Television crews and reporters were staking out the prison in Portage where Dassey is being held, waiting for him to walk out at any minute, when the ruling came down around midday. “We are disappointed more than words can say,” Dassey's attorneys, Steve Drizin and Laura Nirider, said in a statement posted online shortly after the ruling was released. “The fight goes on.” Dassey, now 27, was sentenced to life in prison in 2007 in the death of photographer Teresa Halbach two years earlier. He confessed to detectives that he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape and kill Halbach in the Avery family's salvage yard in Manitowoc County. Avery was sentenced to life in prison in a separate proceeding. Avery and Dassey contend they were framed by police angry with Avery for filing a lawsuit against the county over his wrongful imprisonment for a sexual assault he didn't commit. He's pursuing his own appeal in state court. Their cases gained national attention last year after Netflix aired “Making a Murderer,” a multi-part documentary examining Halbach's death. The series spawned widespread conjecture about the pair's innocence. Authorities who worked on the cases said the documentary was biased, but the series generated calls from the public to free both men. U.S. Magistrate Judge William Duffin ruled in August that investigators coerced Dassey, who was 16 years old at the time and suffered from cognitive problems, into confessing and overturned his conviction. Duffin said in the decision that if state attorneys appealed the ruling Dassey would remain in prison pending a resolution. The state Justice Department filed an appeal that is still working its way through the 7th Circuit. But this week Duffin ordered Dassey released from prison by 8 p.m. Friday. The DOJ filed an emergency motion with the 7th Circuit on Wednesday seeking to block the release, arguing Duffin's release order contradicts his original ruling in which he said Dassey would remain in prison pending the appeal's resolution, Dassey's interrogators used techniques that courts around the country have repeatedly approved and Dassey presents a danger to society. Drizin and Nirider countered with a filing that argued Dassey has behaved in prison and the state hasn't identified any harm that might come from his release. The 7th Circuit judges — Frank Easterbrook, Kenneth Ripple and David Hamilton — issued a two-page ruling Thursday saying only that the state's emergency motion was granted and Dassey will remain behind bars pending the outcome of the appeal. It's unclear when that might come. Briefs in the case aren't due to the 7th Circuit until late December. A decision likely won't come down for weeks or even months later. More Nation",

      "text": "Trades from $ 3 It commonly happens in stock investing that investors miss the chance of buying winning stocks that they knew would stand out. Before they take the plunge, others get to know the hidden potential and enter into these stocks, pushing them out of reach.So, instead of repenting, spotting the off-the-radar potential winners and immediately investing in them could be a smart decision.One such company that looks well positioned for a solid gain, but has been overlooked by investors lately, is Netflix, Inc. ( NFLX - Free Report ) . This internet television network providing stock has actually seen estimates rise over the past month for the current fiscal year by about 36.7%. But that is not yet reflected in its price, as the stock lost 4.4% over the same time frame.You should not be concerned about the price remaining muted going forward. This year’s expected earnings growth over the prior year is 30.7%, which should ultimately translate into price appreciation.And if this isn’t enough, NFLX currently carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) which further underscores the potential for its outperformance (See the performance of Zacks' portfolios and strategies here: About Zacks Performance ).
