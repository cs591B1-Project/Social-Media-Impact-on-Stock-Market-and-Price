Sorting through everything to find the best options is a chore, and you’ve got better things to do this holiday season.\nSo whether you’re looking to make the leap to 4K, upgrade to a smart TV, or just get a bigger and better set, we’ve combed through the stacks of ads to find the very best deals on TVs for you this Black Friday.\n(Note: We try to list the “regular” price of an item, which is usually the MSRP — manufacturer’s suggested retail price.
