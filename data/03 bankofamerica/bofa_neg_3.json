      "text": "Bank stocks like JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) and Bank of America ( BAC ) continued their postelection ascent on Wednesday after President-elect Trump's pick for Treasury secretary told CNBC he would shuck some Dodd-Frank financial regulations.\nThe bank stocks were also helped by Treasury yields, which rose eight basis points to 2.37% Wednesday afternoon.\nBond yields jumped as oil prices spiked on the OPEC agreement to cut oil production . Higher oil prices could spur higher inflation, boosting market rates. A wider yield spread, in turn, could lift profitability for banks, which borrow short-term but lend long-term.\nJPMorgan rose 1.6% in the stock market today , while Bank of America jumped 4.1%. Citigroup ( C ) was up 1.6%. Goldman Sachs ( GS ) and Morgan Stanley ( MS ) were up 3.6% and 1.9%, respectively.\nTrump's Treasury pick, Steven Mnuchin, told CNBC that \"we want to strip back parts of Dodd-Frank that prevent banks from lending.\" Mnuchin is a former Goldman Sachs partner.",

This is a stark contrast to the 90 percent of area retirees, who   latest Merrill Edge® Report – a biannual survey of 1,000 mass affluent Americans 1 , which oversampled 300 Atlanta residents between September 24 and October 5, 2016 – reveals a twist in how today’s younger generations will plan and save for their later years. Twenty-seven percent of area respondents   goals. \n“We are seeing a shift in how Atlanta residents are thinking about retirement and planning for their later years,” said Aron Levine, head of Merrill Edge at Bank of America. “Although many have savings insecurities and are unsure of how much money they are even going to need to achieve their goals, they shouldn’t hesitate to start a long-term plan, so they can take advantage of saving over time.” \nGrowing uncertainty and insecurity around savings \nIn line with the national findings, the report also reveals many Atlanta residents are unable to articulate their “magic number” – the amount of money they need to live their desired retirement and those who can, are underestimating the amount. \nWhen asked what their magic number for retirement is, 59 percent don’t anticipate needing more than $1 million, and 12 percent simply “don’t know.” Approximately two-thirds of today’s retirees said they did not have a number in mind before they retired. \nWhat’s more, 25 percent of respondents cite they need to win the lottery in order to reach their financial goals in retirement. \nIncreasing self-reliance with investment decisions \nDespite this uncertainty, Atlanta respondents still prefer to rely on themselves for their investment approach (64 percent), and only 26 percent believe they need to hire a financial advisor in order to live the retirement they want. \nWhen asked why they are saving for retirement, many area residents cite to afford daily life (63 percent) and take care of family (52 percent). \n  full   \n\n1   Edge Merrill  ",

Penney to buy from neutral, predicting an inflection point in earnings and cash flow as the retailer broadens its product offerings, and reaps of the benefits of a \"middle-class spending resurgence\" under President-elect Donald Trump. \n\"We think JCP will drive industry-leading same store sales growth, primarily due to moves into nonapparel categories, and margin improvement as it fixes legacy supply chain issues,\" equity analyst Lorraine Hutchinson wrote in a research note. \n\"An economic resurgence in the middle class under the Trump administration would provide upside to our outlook,\" she said. \nAfter treading water for five years, shares of J.C. Penney have surged 48 percent in 2016, positioning the stock for its best yearly gain since 2004.",

Trump. The president-elect has done what Moynihan has struggled to do: make Bank of America’s stock great again. \nThe shares of America’s second-largest bank by assets (ticker: BAC) are up 20% since the Nov. 8 election, to a record $21, as rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve bode well for the bank’s profits. Also, regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 seem likely to be diluted, if not repealed, under a Trump administration. \nThe rally’s fierceness surprised many investors who thought BofA’s stock would languish until the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates. Worse, it created regrets for those positioned improperly heading into the election. But the proper put-and-call strategy could enable investors to get paid for agreeing to buy Bank of America’s shares at a lower price. \nWhen the stock was selling at $20.33 in late November, investors could sell the January 20 put for 71 cents and buy the January 21 call for 52 cents. The trade credit of 19 cents meant the options market was paying investors for agreeing to buy the stock below $20. The expiration captures fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 13. \nShould the stock advance to, say, $23, the call is worth $2. If the stock falls below $20, investors should buy the stock rather than cover the short put. \nThe risk that the stock will fall far below the put strike price is tempered by the unlikelihood that the yield curve will suddenly flatten. More likely, it will stay firm—or rise—because investors expect Trump to pare postcrisis banking rules that have reduced risk-taking, and arguably profitability, while increasing federal oversight and compliance expenses. While Moynihan won’t comment on the impact of Trump’s victory on Bank of America shares, he is happy to talk about why the bank is positioned to prosper. \n“Our strategy is straightforward: We have to grow; growth has to come by doing more with our customers and clients, with acceptable risk, and in a sustainable fashion over time,” he wrote in an email. “We call that ‘responsible growth,’ and it is the best way to serve our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.” More From Barron’s",

KBW told clients last week that BofA could have “the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers,” and that “the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates.”\nIn essence, Moynihan might finally get the credit he deserves for having stripped the bank to a muscular core. The moves were necessary: His management team needed every penny available to help BofA recover from its near-death experience in the financial crisis. Now, higher rates and an improving economy mean the bank should make more money.\nThe pending earnings report will tell a lot more than whether Bank of America meets or beats analyst expectations of 32 cents a share in profit on revenue of $21 billion. The recommended options trade suggests that investors will finally give BofA credit for being in fighting trim, and realize its stock is poised to grow nicely from here. \nOIL PRICES SURGED Wednesday on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is limiting production for the first time in eight years, but the options market simply yawned. The lack of action likely reflects concern that the dollar will strengthen, sending crude prices lower.\nInvestors who think oil will trade more on supply issues than the dollar should think about selling puts on ExxonMobil (XOM). With the stock at $87.30, the April 85 put could be sold for $2.91. If the stock advances, investors can keep the premium. Should it decline, they get to buy the stock at an effective price of $82.09. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEVEN SEARS is the author of The Indomitable Investor: Why a Few Succeed in the Stock Market When Everyone Else Fails . \nComments: steve.sears@barrons.com , http://twitter.com/sm_sears \n\nLike Barron’s on Facebook \nFollow Barron’s on Twitter",

Trump. The president-elect has done what Moynihan has struggled to do: make Bank of America’s stock great again.\nThe shares of America’s second-largest bank by assets (ticker: BAC) are up 20% since the Nov. 8 election, to a record $21, as rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve bode well for the bank’s profits. Also, regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 seem likely to be diluted, if not repealed, under a Trump administration.\nThe rally’s fierceness surprised many investors who thought BofA’s stock would languish until the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates. Worse, it created regrets for those positioned improperly heading into the election. But the proper put-and-call strategy could enable investors to get paid for agreeing to buy Bank of America’s shares at a lower price.\nWhen the stock was selling at $20.33 in late November, investors could sell the January 20 put for 71 cents and buy the January 21 call for 52 cents. The trade credit of 19 cents meant the options market was paying investors for agreeing to buy the stock below $20. The expiration captures fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 13. \nShould the stock advance to, say, $23, the call is worth $2. If the stock falls below $20, investors should buy the stock rather than cover the short put.\nThe risk that the stock will fall far below the put strike price is tempered by the unlikelihood that the yield curve will suddenly flatten. More likely, it will stay firm—or rise—because investors expect Trump to pare postcrisis banking rules that have reduced risk-taking, and arguably profitability, while increasing federal oversight and compliance expenses. While Moynihan won’t comment on the impact of Trump’s victory on Bank of America shares, he is happy to talk about why the bank is positioned to prosper.\n“Our strategy is straightforward: We have to grow; growth has to come by doing more with our customers and clients, with acceptable risk, and in a sustainable fashion over time,” he wrote in an email. “We call that ‘responsible growth,’ and it is the best way to serve our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nMore From Barron’s Byron Wien Ponders the Coming Trump Presidency \n9 Stocks to Short Now \nAMC Entertainment Eyes Blockbuster Stock Returns \nAnalysts are upgrading their earnings models to reflect Trump’s impact on the bank.

The moves were necessary: His management team needed every penny available to help BofA recover from its near-death experience in the financial crisis. Now, higher rates and an improving economy mean the bank should make more money.\nThe pending earnings report will tell a lot more than whether Bank of America meets or beats analyst expectations of 32 cents a share in profit on revenue of $21 billion.

      "text": "Why the Latest Unemployment Data Is Such Good News for Bank of America \nBy John Maxfield \nImage source: iStock/Thinkstock. \nContinue Reading Below \nOn the first Friday of every month, the U.S. Labor Department publishes the official unemployment rate for the previous month. The latest reading was positive, which will ratchet up pressure on the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates and thereby spur revenue and earnings at Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) . \nThe Labor Department said today ( here's the official press release ) that the unemployment rate in the United States fell to 4.6% last month. That's incredibly low. The last time it was that low was in August 2007, near the heights of the pre-financial crisis housing bubble. \nData sources: Federal Reserve of St. Louis and U.S. Labor Department. Chart by author. More From Fool.com He Made 21,078% Buying Amazon. Heres His New Pick Why low unemployment is good for banks \nThe significance of this for bank stocks, Bank of America in particular , can't be overstated. One of the main ways banks generate revenue is by making loans. The problem they've faced over the past few years, however, is that interest rates are essentially as low as they've ever been, which reduces the yield on a bank's loan portfolio. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nThe Federal Reserve has kept interest rates low in an effort to boost the economy -- to \"provide accommodation\" in the official vernacular. More specifically, under the central bank's congressional mandate, the Fed is responsible for minimizing unemployment and inflation. \nWith an unemployment rate of 4.6%, down from 4.9% in October, it has more than accomplished the first of these objectives. Moreover, with inflation expectations ticking up, evidenced by the sharp rise in the interest rate on 10-year Treasury bonds (interest rates and inflation tend to go hand in hand), there's bound to be a growing chorus of support at the Fed to raise rates at its meeting this month. \nFed Chair Janet Yellen has essentially said as much. Testifying before Congress in November ( here are her prepared remarks ), Yellen said that interest rates could rise \" relatively soon \" if the economy continued to recover: \"At our meeting earlier this month, the Committee judged that the case for an increase in the target range had continued to strengthen and that such an increase could well become appropriate relatively soon if incoming data provide some further evidence of continued progress toward the Committee's objectives.\" \nSuffice it to say that the latest unemployment figures certainly provide \"further evidence of continued progress.\" An important nuance to keep in mind \nNow, it's worth pointing out that the official unemployment rate doesn't capture a number of nuances that make the employment picture seem less optimistic. This is because it excludes people who don't have jobs and aren't actively seeking jobs from the calculation. Consequently, if a lot of people have gotten discouraged and stopped looking for jobs, then they aren't considered unemployed for the purposes of the official unemployment rate. \nThis was the case last month for more than 400,000 people who voluntarily stopped looking for work. By contrast, the economy added a net 178,000 jobs last month. The reason the unemployment rate dropped so far, in other words, isn't because a lot of new jobs were created, but rather because people dropped out of the active labor force, lowering the labor-force participation rate. \nIn fact, if you include people who aren't actively seeking work, or people who are working part-time but would rather have a full-time job, then the unemployment rate in November was 9.3%, down from 9.5% the previous month. \nEither way, though, the important thing to appreciate is that the data is moving in the right direction, which is very good news for banks. As I've noted ad nauseam over the past few months, if interest rates rise a mere 100 basis points, or 1 percentage point, Bank of America stands to generate $5.3 billion in additional net interest income -- that is, on top of the roughly $40 billion in annual net interest income that it already earns. \nThis is high-margin revenue because it doesn't require Bank of America to do anything new to generate it. It doesn't have to hire more workers, build new branches, or invest in technology. It can just continue doing what it's already doing -- making loans -- and it'll make more money doing so. As a result, most of this revenue, less corporate income taxes, should fall to Bank of America's bottom line. \nTo complete the circle, then, higher interest rates should further increase the value of Bank of America's stock, which is dictated in large part by the bank's profitability. Along these same lines, it will make it easier for Bank of America to boost its dividend next year. \n10 stocks we like better than Bank of America When investing geniuses David and Tom Gardner have a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

      "title": "Analysis of the Occult Symbols Found on the Bank of America Murals | Alternative",
      "text": "(Before It's News)\nby The Vigilant Citizen\nProminently displayed in the lobby of the Bank of America’s Corporate Center are “creepy” frescoes, filled with occult symbols. Even more unsettling is the fact that those images seem to predict events of a radical world change in the not-so-distant future. Are those murals predicting the coming of an occult New World Order? We will look at the occult meaning of the symbols found on the Bank of America frescoes.\nA reader of Infowars sent me pictures of some very odd murals displayed at the Bank of America Corporate Center in Charlotte, NC. Needless to say they immediately caught my attention, as I was flabbergasted by their symbolism and their message. I also couldn’t help relating them to the ominous murals of the Denver International Airport .\nPainted by Benjamin Long, the paintings are said to revolve around the themes of “making/building, chaos/creativity, and planning/knowledge in a “daring blend of abstract and realism, set off with touches of gold“ . The three frescoes ruling over the lobby of the Bank of America Corporate Center.\nAlthough we normally read from left to right, there are clues within the frescoes hinting the viewers to read the paintings from right to left. The “planning” stage (visually represented by the fresco on the right) is normally the first step of any process so it would make sense to start from there. There is also alchemical symbolism hinting towards the chronology of the frescoes, so we will begin with the one on the right:\nRight Fresco\nThe fresco on the right is dubbed Planning/Knowledge. An esoteric read of its symbolism reveals exactly what is being planned and what knowledge it is referring to.\nMasonic Boy on Masonic Floor\nWe see here a young blond boy standing on a standard Masonic checker-board pattern floor. His feet are placed at a 90 degrees angle, in accordance to Masonic initiation ritual:\n“Q. On your return to the Lodge, where were you placed, as the youngest Entered Apprentice?\nA. In the northeast corner, my feet forming a right angle, my body erect, at the right hand of the Worshipful Master in the east, an upright man and Mason, and it was given me strictly in charge ever to walk and act as such.” – Malcolm C. Duncan, Duncan’s Masonic Ritual and Monitor\nSeemingly underneath the boy are people dressed in business suits, seemingly strategizing while pointing at the Masonic boy. Does the boy represent the “new generation”?\nThis blond boy is very reminiscent of the blond boy featured at the center of one of the murals of the Denver International Airport.\nBlond boy hammering a sword into a plowshare. Note that the boy is wearing a traditional Bavarian costume … perhaps as in Bavarian Illuminati?\nBurning Bush, Woman in Cube and Pyramid Symbolism overload\nBehind the boy is a tree on fire, which is a reference of the Burning Bush of the Old Testament. The Burning Bush is of great importance in Masonic ritual, especially for the 33rd degree, whose members are considered to be “near the Burning Bush”.\n“In the third Exodus it is record that, while Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro on Mount Horeb, “the angle of Lord appeared unto him in a flame of fire out of the midst of a bush”, and there communicated to him for the first time his Ineffable Name. This occurrence is commemorated in the Burning Bush of the Royal Arch Degree. In all systems of antiquity, fire is adopted as a symbol of Deity; and the Burning Bush, or the bush filled with fire which did not consume, whence came forth the Tetragrammaton, the symbol of Divine Light and Truth, is considered in the advanced degrees of Freemasonry, like the Orient in the lower, as the great source of true Masonic light; wherefore Supreme Councils of the Thirty-Third Degree date their balustres or official documents, “near the B.B.” or Burning Bush, to intimate that they are, in their own rite, the exclusive source of all Masonic instruction”.\n– Albert G. Mackey, Encyclopedia of Freemasonry, Part 1\nIn the background is an Egyptian pyramid, the ultimate symbol of the Mysteries in occult teachings.\nA strange feature of the painting is the woman apparently trapped inside a transparent cube, hanging from threads coming from the sky. Does she represent the common man, stuck in the confines of the material world (occultly represented by the cube) and manipulated by unseen the forces from above?\nStairs and Black Sun\nJacob’s ladder and a black sun\nOn the left of the image are stairs, apparently leading to the heavens, a classic symbol representing the path to illumination/Illuminati through the mysteries of Masonry.\nA Masonic engraving depicting stairs leading from the Masonic floor to the “outside” In the sky is a black sun, another symbol of an esoteric significance. Hermetic traditions teach the existence of two suns, an invisible and etheric one made of pure “philosophical gold” and the material one, the only one the profane can perceive, known as the Black Sun.\nIn alchemy, the black sun (Sol niger) is the name of the result of the first stage of the Opus Magnum. The alchemical Magnum Opus (or Great Work) starts with the “blackening” – the calcination of crude metals – and ends with their transmutation into pure gold.\nToday, the symbol of the Black Sun is mostly associated with esoteric Nazism and cults such as the Temple of Set. It is also found in odd places such as:\nBracken House, London. The Black Sun beares the face of Winston Churchill. …and, once again, the Denver International Airport. Floor design in the DIA depicting a black sun moving in front of the golden sun\nThe right fresco therefore seems to portray the first step of a “Great Work” that needs to be accomplished, as symbolically represented by the black sun. Men dressed in suits (one of them oddly looks like Adam Weishaupt), seem to be preparing a new generation of Masonic youth. Meanwhile, the “profane” seem to be idling in an translucent cube, controlled by invisible puppeteers.\nMiddle Fresco\nThe middle fresco, Chaos/Creativity, depicts a turbulent transitional period. Many details within the painting describe this profound turmoil, which seem to be affecting all part of society and civilization. We find military and religious figures, people protesting and much more. Barb wires, nets and soldiers on the streets tell the viewers that this period of turmoil is also one of oppression. The nun does not seem very pleased either.\nAt the left of the painting is a person wearing a biohazard suit, hinting to some kind of chemical warfare. Person in gas suit\nFor this reason, and many more, I find this painting very similar to one of the Denver Airport’s murals … the most infamous one. This mural of the DIA portrays a militaristic figure wearing a gas mask and oppressing an endless line of sad people. Chemical warfare, military repression, dead babies … what is there not to like about this image?\nIf we look at the top of the fresco, we see translucent beings spinning with fire, perhaps implying that the turmoil is also happening on a metaphysical, cosmic or astral level. Spinning naked bodies in a vortex of fire\nThis round fiery shape can also be likened to a sun. Its pale golden color and the transparency of its figures can be associated with the intermediate step of the great alchemical work named “Whitening”. Jung compared this step with daybreak, the preparation for the next and final stage, which is the sunrise, characterized by the color red. Which is, of course, the most prominent color of the left fresco.\nLeft Fresco\nThe fresco on the left is said to focus on the theme of “Making/Building“. The main figure of the fresco is a worker holding a shovel, contemplating the work done. In his back pocket is a red piece of cloth, a symbolic detail in the context of this image. There is indeed a great emphasis on the color red in this fresco, which, as mentioned above, is the also the color associated with the final step of the alchemical Magnum Opus: Rubedo, the “Red Work”.\nIn occult teachings, alchemical transformation can happen on numerous levels: a material level, where crude metals are transmuted to pure gold, but also on a spiritual and philosophical level, where the profane man becomes a “regenerated man”. In secret-society lore, the entire world is considered to be the subject of alchemical transformation; it is said to be an imperfect plane needing to be “transmuted into gold” in order to mirror the heavens, in accordance with the hermetic axiom “As Above, So Below”. Is a New World Order the “Great Work” of the occult elite?\nSleeping Giant\nIs he dead or sleeping? And what does “EQ” mean? An odd detail of the fresco is this man blending with the earth, apparently in deep sleep … or is he buried? This is also reminiscent of the (unsettling) sleeping little boy on the DIA murals. A helpless little boy sleeping (or dead) under a red blanket\nWhat Is The Meaning of the Frescoes?\nLike most elitist art, the frescoes on display at the headquarters of Bank of America, the largest bank in America, tell a story intended to be decoded by those in the know. The frescoes seem to depict three stages of world transformation – planning, chaos and achievement – and are color-coded to be analogous to the three stages of hermetic alchemy: Nigredo (blackness), Albedo (whiteness) and Rubedo (redness). The frescoes beare many resemblances to the murals of the Denver International Airport, which also depict progressive phases of a profound transformation of society after a period of intense turmoil.\nThe first fresco displays a wide array of occult symbols, some directly referring to Freemasonry. This is quite astonishing as the painting is in the lobby of the headquarters of the United States’ most predominant bank and not in a Masonic lodge … but perhaps there is some overlap. Those who are “in the know” and initiated to the Mysteries are those who are qualified to accomplishing the planning process, which in this painting seem to be the men in suits, whose ties match the red and white checker-board floor, and who make plans for the future generation, represented by the blond Masonic boy.\nIn the second fresco, civil unrest, riots, protests and repression are all taking place. Historically, the masses only usually go into an outright revolt when their living conditions deteriorate significantly or when hugely unpopular policies get adopted. Does this piece refer to the loss of civil liberties and the rise of a police state? There is also a metaphysical aspect to the image, represented by the spinning naked bodies that appear as the sun, implying that the period turmoil is also happening on a cosmic level.\nThe last fresco gives a sense of “mission accomplished”, with the dominant figure surveying the work, while also conveying the message that “the work is never totally done” as labourers are still hard at work in the underground. This is reminiscent of the movie Metropolis, where a class of workers silently slave away underground to sustain the elite’s utopia. I also can’t help but being reminded of the 33 Chilean miners while looking at those workers …\nIn Conclusion\nThe Bank of America frescoes are yet another example of the elite’s agenda being “hidden in plain sight”. These giant images, on display for all to see, but designed to be understood by few, describe the philosophy of the elite rulers, their occult knowledge and their plans for the future. As it is the case for all works of art, it is possible to interpret these paintings on numerous levels and to come up with different conclusions. It is, however, difficult to ignore the recurrent themes found in the”Sinister Sites” described on The Vigilant Citizen: prevalent occult symbolism, the heralding of a “new era”, contempt for the profane masses, celebration of repression and war, etc. When comparing the Bank of America frescoes with the art of the DIA and the Georgia Guidestones , we can find a definite consistence in their symbolism, their tone and their message. This leads me to believe that the same group is behind all of those sites and many more. Whoever they are, we know a few things for sure: they are extremely rich, extremely powerful and they don’t really like you … because you are not one of Them.\nRELATED POSTS Let’s block ads!

      "text": "  2 OF 6 Has Bank of America Stock Lost Its Steam?   Bank of America rose 22% in November \nBank of America had a great November thanks to Donald Trump’s presidential victory. However, it also led to several downgrades for the stock. The stock rose 22% in November. The recent rally led analysts to see limited upside potential for the stock. \nLast week, we saw Guggenheim and Baird cut Bank of America’s stock ratings. Deutsche Bank cut its ratings on the stock. It advised investors to “take profits and selectively reduce exposure” to US banks ( XLF ). Baird analyst David George cut Bank of America to “neutral” from “overweight.” In a note to investors, he mentioned, “We like the company’s improving operating leverage, steady risk-adjusted growth, and prospects for more aggressive capital return, but shares have rallied ~30% QTD, and we would wait for a larger pullback before adding to positions.” \nGuggenheim analysts Eric Wasserstrom and Jeff Cantwell downgraded Bank of America to “neutral” from “buy.” They explained in an investor’s note, “Our downgrade is motivated by three factors: 1) Although we are increasing our fair value estimate to $22 from $19, the shares are now within 10% of this valuation, which embeds our above-consensus EPS estimates for 2017-18 and reflects our expectations for incremental cost reductions and improving asset growth. 2) Further, we believe that additional upside to our EPS estimates will be increasingly driven by macro-factors rather than company-specific drivers, an outlook that may now be more fully discounted in the stock’s valuation. 3) The shares’ current valuation is also in line with its historical level relative to the peer group.” \nEarlier in the month, Deutsche Bank ( DB ) downgraded Bank of America to “hold” from “buy.” It assigned a target price of $17.5. Deutsche Bank analyst Matt O’Connor thinks that Bank of America isn’t trading at discount valuations. He lowered his target upside for the stock. In a note to investors last week he said, “Our $17.50 target price assumes BAC shares trade at a 5% premium to our target group multiple for the Market Sensitive banks ( WFC ) of ~11x our 2017E given continued execution on expenses, capital and credit.”  [\"BAC\",\"C\",\"DB\",\"WFC\",\"XLF\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Bank of America Corp\",\"Citigroup Inc.\",\"Deutsche Bank AG (USA)\",\"Wells Fargo & Company\",\"Financial  ",

      "text": "Trump’s victory was a boon to Bank of America. Bloomberg News \nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America BAC 2.87329251059821% Bank of America Corp.

Trump. The president-elect has done what Moynihan has struggled to do: make Bank of America’s stock great again.\nThe shares of America’s second-largest bank by assets (ticker: BAC) are up 20% since the Nov. 8 election, to a record $21, as rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve bode well for the bank’s profits. Also, regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 seem likely to be diluted, if not repealed, under a Trump administration.\nThe rally’s fierceness surprised many investors who thought BofA’s stock would languish until the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates. Worse, it created regrets for those positioned improperly heading into the election. But the proper put-and-call strategy could enable investors to get paid for agreeing to buy Bank of America’s shares at a lower price.\nWhen the stock was selling at $20.33 in late November, investors could sell the January 20 put for 71 cents and buy the January 21 call for 52 cents. The trade credit of 19 cents meant the options market was paying investors for agreeing to buy the stock below $20. The expiration captures fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 13. \nShould the stock advance to, say, $23, the call is worth $2. If the stock falls below $20, investors should buy the stock rather than cover the short put.\nThe risk that the stock will fall far below the put strike price is tempered by the unlikelihood that the yield curve will suddenly flatten. More likely, it will stay firm—or rise—because investors expect Trump to pare postcrisis banking rules that have reduced risk-taking, and arguably profitability, while increasing federal oversight and compliance expenses. While Moynihan won’t comment on the impact of Trump’s victory on Bank of America shares, he is happy to talk about why the bank is positioned to prosper.\n“Our strategy is straightforward: We have to grow; growth has to come by doing more with our customers and clients, with acceptable risk, and in a sustainable fashion over time,” he wrote in an email. “We call that ‘responsible growth,’ and it is the best way to serve our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nMore From Barron’s Byron Wien Ponders the Coming Trump Presidency \n9 Stocks to Short Now \nAMC Entertainment Eyes Blockbuster Stock Returns \nAnalysts are upgrading their earnings models to reflect Trump’s impact on the bank. KBW told clients last week that BofA could have “the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers,” and that “the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates.”\nIn essence, Moynihan might finally get the credit he deserves for having stripped the bank to a muscular core. The moves were necessary: His management team needed every penny available to help BofA recover from its near-death experience in the financial crisis. Now, higher rates and an improving economy mean the bank should make more money.\nThe pending earnings report will tell a lot more than whether Bank of America meets or beats analyst expectations of 32 cents a share in profit on revenue of $21 billion. The recommended options trade suggests that investors will finally give BofA credit for being in fighting trim, and realize its stock is poised to grow nicely from here. \nOIL PRICES SURGED Wednesday on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is limiting production for the first time in eight years, but the options market simply yawned. The lack of action likely reflects concern that the dollar will strengthen, sending crude prices lower.\nInvestors who think oil will trade more on supply issues than the dollar should think about selling puts on ExxonMobil (XOM). With the stock at $87.30, the April 85 put could be sold for $2.91. If the stock advances, investors can keep the premium. Should it decline, they get to buy the stock at an effective price of $82.09. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEVEN SEARS is the author of The Indomitable Investor: Why a Few Succeed in the Stock Market When Everyone Else Fails . \nComments: steve.sears@barrons.com , http://twitter.com/sm_sears \n\nLike Barron’s on Facebook \nFollow Barron’s on Twitter",

      "text": "The Most And Least Loved Stocks In The S&P 500 (Seeking Alpha) \nIn a year that has flown in the face of all expectations, the top five traded stocks on Black Friday broke from tradition. \nHistorically, Black Friday trading focuses on retail stocks expected to increase revenues because of the holiday season. This year, however, TD Ameritrade clients spent their Black Friday trading five unexpected stocks: Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC ), Freeport-McMoRan Inc (NYSE: FCX ), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ), Cliffs Natural Resources Inc (NYSE: CLF ) and DryShips Inc. (NASDAQ: DRYS ). \nAccording to TD Ameritrade, this is likely due to President-elect Donald Trump’s announcement that he will spend $1 trillion on infrastructure. DryShips' Intrigue Continued \nTD Ameritrade’s chief market strategist, JJ Kinahan, believes DryShips’ popularity stems from investors’ draw to risk. Kinahan believes volatility can scare people away, “but for people who are educated, volatility isn’t a bad word.” \n“A lot of [people] trade where there’s volatility. Those that like that type of trade have been drawn to DryShips,” Kinahan said. “For most people, they should not be there. But we do have a lot of sophisticated people who will be there because they understand the risks. I would never encourage people to be there but when there’s action, people will go that action.” \nDryShips was also the top traded name via mobile during Black Friday. The sales event saw an all-time high of mobile-placed trades, with almost 24 percent of trades coming from mobile. Bank Of America, A 'Relatively Inexpensive' Name \nKinahan believes Bank of America's increase in Black Friday trading came from its “relatively inexpensive” stock. \n“I think sometimes people lose sight of the fact that retail investors work with a finite amount of money,” Kinahan said. “A stock like BAC allows people to play what they want to play and not have to dedicate a lot of their portfolio.” Old Faithfuls \nWith all the unusual activity this Black Friday, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL ) and Amazon still remained two of the top held stocks by TD Ameritrade clients. \n“Amazon and Apple make sense to me,” Kinahan said. “It’s interesting that if you look over the last few years, a stock like Alibaba Group Holding Ltd (NYSE: BABA ) you might have expected to see on there and it wasn’t.”  ",

      "title": "Two nonprofits receive Neighborhood Builders grant",
      "text": "Through the Neighborhood Builders grant from Bank of America, two Atlanta nonprofit organizations will receive resources to further their mission in Atlanta neighborhoods. The Atlanta Music Project and The Center for Working Families received $200,000 each towards their organization, leadership development for the executive director and emerging leader and a network of peer organizations across the country.\n“The bank seeks to help strengthen the financial health of the communities we serve. We created Neighborhood Builders to address issues fundamental to economic mobility and help Atlanta nonprofits more effectively address pressing needs in their communities,” said Wendy Stewart, Atlanta market president.\nThe two chosen organizations are making respective impact in their communities. AMP provides intensive, tuition-free music education for underserved youth right in their neighborhood.\n“Practically all of metro Atlanta’s youth orchestra and choir programs are located north of Interstate 20. South of I-20 there are scores of neighborhoods lacking the opportunity for kids to join a local music program,” said Dantes Rameau, co-founder and executive director. “AMP is filling an immense void that nurtures critical holistic child development and, through youth music ensembles, contributes to neighborhood vitality.”\nAMP provides all its students with an instrument, a teaching artist, classes and numerous public performance opportunities. With its grant, AMP is planning a new headquarters in the heart of the communities it serves.\nThe Center for Working Families supports hardworking families with soft and hard skills training, connecting residents to meaningful employment, individual coaching, financial literacy and supportive services.\n“In 2006, TCWFI started as a place-based model working in the neighborhoods surrounding Turner Field with a holistic approach that included one-on-one coaching, bundled services and attention to the needs of the whole family,” said Che D. Watkins, president and CEO. “As development continues on the Southside of Atlanta, it is critical to ensure that its residents have the training, access to employment and supports necessary to benefit and advance. The Neighborhood Builders grant will allow us to increase our footprint to serve even more families who share the same desires and aspirations for gainful employment and a thriving community.”\nThe two organizations also seek volunteers to keep their mission going. AMP seeks adults to join the AMP Street Team, help out with logistics at major concerts and run-out shows, professionals from all backgrounds to participate in the Practice Makes Professional series and high school musicians for its AMP Music Mentor program.\nAt TCWFI, volunteers can help through its various programs, fundraising or more to help children and families do well.\n“Neighborhood Builders is an important part of our efforts to help Atlantans thrive. When Atlanta residents and the city thrive, our company is successful,” added Stewart.",

Higher interest rate structure, that's good for Bank of America,\" Moynihan told \" Squawk on the Street ,\" adding that the bank has built its business model on the expectation that rates will rise soon. \nAnd that's not even factoring in President-elect Donald Trump's call to roll back regulations on banks, which Moynihan said may remove hurdles that deterred investors from doling out capital as freely as they wanted. \nMore capital for banks means more capital released to their shareholders and more loans given out, Moynihan said, and as a result, banks can help drive the economy upward. \n\"If you think about those types of things, it's no surprise that we've pushed up hard\" in the market, the executive said.",

Bank of America is moving its name and downtown Norfolk regional headquarters across the street to Dominion Tower at 999 Waterside Drive. Bank of America leaders reflect on company's local legacy, discuss future Buy Now Steve Earley | The Virginian-Pilot \nWorkers from River City Sign Co. dismantle the Bank of America sign at the top of 1 Commercial Place in downtown Norfolk on Nov. 21. The building is being converted into 275 apartments and ground-floor retail by developer Frank “Buddy” Gadams, owner of Marathon Development. The 24-story apartment building will be called Icon at Citywalk. Bank of America is moving its name and downtown Norfolk regional headquarters across the street to Dominion Tower at 999 Waterside Drive. \nIt probably won’t come as a total surprise, but you can add banking to the list of issues that are influenced by the unique geography and culture of Hampton Roads. \nSome see the area’s waterways, highways, bridges and tunnels as links. Others see them as barriers. Despite those historical and jurisdictional lines – or connections, depending on how you view them – Hampton Roads, with 1.7 million residents and 17 jurisdictions, is a major market for the second-largest bank in the U.S., based on assets. \n“I just see it all as one region and try to make sure everybody understands that we’ve got to work together, win together,” said Victor Branch, who is the Richmond market president for Bank of America. Branch, who has been with the bank for 32 years, began his career in banking with a predecessor company, Sovran Bank. \nAround that time, “merger fever really kicked in after that in the ‘80s,” said Branch, who added that “the benefits of mergers far outweigh the negatives.” Banks, he continued, are “dynamic, growing” organizations, and people who can’t adapt to change “aren’t going to do well within this industry and particularly within our bank.” \nIn addition to the Richmond market, Branch also oversees the bank’s corporate social responsibility and environmental, social and governance initiatives in the Hampton Roads, Richmond and Charlottesville markets. \nThe bank declined to disclose market-specific information, with Branch saying only that hundreds of company employees work in Hampton Roads . However, a corporate snapshot provides some perspective on the bank’s size and influence. \nAt the start of the third quarter of 2016, Bank of America had more than $27.8 billion in retail deposits, $488.2 billion in home loans year-to-date and 142 financial centers in Virginia. In addition, the Bank of America Foundation had provided about $2.9 million in grants and matching gifts to area nonprofits. \nCharlie Henderson, Bank of America’s market president for Hampton Roads, has had a front row seat to many changes in the past four decades. He got his start in the industry in 1974 after graduating from Hampden-Sydney College working for a competing bank in the Richmond area. \nThat bank, Henderson said, “was very transactional-oriented, and I was really looking to join a company that thought in terms of building relationships.” For that reason, Henderson said, it “was an easy transition in ‘79 to leave my former employer” to join what is today Bank of America. \n“I’ve always wanted to make a difference in people’s lives and in the communities where I live. And through the financial services industry, I’ve had that opportunity,” said Henderson, who also reflected on his role in seeing the company merge and grow. \n“I had a front row seat during our mergers-and-acquisition phase. At that time, I was part of our community development banking group. And I actually had the responsibility of traveling to the new markets where we were acquiring an institution.” \nThrough those listening sessions, “it helped us build a strategic plan, so when we went into these new communities, we hit the ground running to serve the needs of the community and our clients and our customers.” \nIn Hampton Roads, much of that action and customer and community support will now be led from 999 Waterside Drive. Bank of America recently relocated its regional headquarters across the street to Norfolk’s tallest building after decades at 1 Commercial Place, which has stood for more than 50 years. \nHaving the company’s lines of business all housed together in Dominion Tower is a positive aspect of the recent move, said Branch, who added that “you can’t put a price tag on teammates seeing each other on a regular basis.” \nWeather permitting, the Bank of America logo will be installed on two sides of the building before the end of the year, and the remaining two sides will get signage in early 2017. The 26-story building, however, will still be referred to as Dominion Tower, The Virginian-Pilot reported. \n“The fact that we were able to stay downtown with our corporate headquarters here in Hampton Roads really demonstrates to the city of Norfolk and to the Hampton Roads region that Bank of America still remains very vibrant and dedicated to serving the needs of our community, our customers and our clients,” Henderson said. \nOne community event that Henderson said he’s especially proud of is the bank’s support and involvement in Give Local 757. The Peninsula Community Foundation, the Hampton Roads Community Foundation and the Southeast Virginia Community Foundation also are involved. \nIn May, Give Local 757 held a 24-hour event to support nonprofit organizations in the region. The effort raised about $500,000. “In 2017, we’re going to once again have Give Local 757 with the goal of raising $1 million for the nonprofits here in Hampton Roads,” Henderson said. Tags ",

      "text": "CNBC.com SHARES \nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America's chairman and CEO, shared his views on the market and regulatory environment in an extensive interview with CNBC's Wilfred Frost on Tuesday. \nOn the rally after Donald Trump's victory: \"And the election then basically focused people on a few things. Faster growth, that's good for Bank of America. A higher interest rate structure, that's good for Bank of America. ... So if you think about those types of things, it's no surprise we pushed up hard,\" he said. \nOn government regulation: \"We're self-interested as an industry. We have an obligation through the FDIC to pay the cost cleanup. We want reasonable regulation and we think it is appropriate,\" Moynihan said. \nPreviously, Moynihan ran Bank of America's consumer and small-business banking, wealth management and investment banking divisions. \nHe also discusses: The mergers and acquisitions environment Technology cost savings from the cloud Rising interest rates",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Activists say J.P. Morgan and Bank of America Have a Big Gender Gap Problem \nCall it too big to pay fair. \nA group of investors are targeting the nation’s largest banks, pushing for a break up of Wall Street’s boy’s club. Pax World Management, Arjuna Capital, and Trillium Asset Management are asking several financial giants including Goldman Sachs gs , Citigroup c , Bank of America bac , and Wells Fargo wfc to disclose their pay data for men and women, Bloomberg reported. \nThe investors, who have made headway on pay disparity with tech giants including Amazon and Apple , are trying to do the same in the finance sector. \n“Given the financial benefits of diverse leadership teams, the female talent gap is simply bad for business,” Natasha Lamb, Arjuna Capital’s director of equity research and shareholder engagement, told Bloomberg in an email. \nAlready, Arjuna Capital has filed proposals with Bank of America, Wells Fargo, American Express , and Citigroup. The trio plans to do the same at J.P. Morgan Chase jpm on Tuesday. \n\nEarlier, the group managed to get Amazon and Apple to disclose their gender pay gaps. \nWall street has long been criticized for being a “boy’s club.” The industry is largely dominated by men, with only 10% of U.S. fund managers being women , according to a Morningstar report. A separate 2016 Glassdoor study estimates that men are paid 6.4% more than women in the financial industry, and 7.2% more in the insurance industry . ",

      "text": "By Ben Levisohn Bank stocks like Goldman Sachs ( GS ), Bank of America ( BAC ), Citigroup ( C ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ) and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ) have soared since Donald Trump’s election victory –and everyone who is everyone is expecting a pullback . Morgan Stanley’s Betsy Graseck and team recommend buying any weakness. They explain why:\nGetty Images After the recent 3 standard deviation move in the large cap bank stocks, some investors are asking why not step to the sidelines. We do expect the stocks to pull back a bit in early 2017 as rates settle down and Congress debates which tax breaks to eliminate in order to lower corporate and personal tax rates and what infrastructure proposals to run with. But we would use those pullbacks to add to exposures as we see a higher probability of the bull case unfolding than the bear case during 2017…\nOur price targets, using our base case 2018e EPS and target P/E of ~12x, imply 14% upside for our 8 Overweight-rated stocks and median upside of 6% for the group. Using our bull case 2018e EPS with no increase in multiples from the base case, we see upside of 41% for our Overweight-rated stocks and median upside of 30% for the group. We believe large cap banks are Attractive in our base case, especially considering our strategist’s call for only a modest 4% increase in the S&P 500 in 2017. Optionality is to the upside even if only half of our bull case plays out by 2018…\nTop Picks. Citi and Synchrony Financial ( SYF ) on stronger capital return. Bank of America on higher rates and lower expenses. Goldman Sachs on rising market volatility and improving VAR productivity. JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo on stronger loan growth and expense management. Capital One Financial ( COF ) and Discover Financial Services ( DFS ) on rising consumer leverage and higher capital return.\nShares of Citigroup have risen 0.9% to $57.81 at 1:57 p.m. today, while Synchrony Financial has advanced 0.9% to $35.42, Bank of America has rallied 0.7% to $22.00, Goldman Sachs has gained 0.8% to $230.32, JPMorgan Chase has ticked down 0.1% to $83.17, Wells Fargo has climbed 1.5% to $55.14, Capital One Financial has edged up 0.5% to $87.10, and Discover Financial Services has risen 0.9% to $68.07.",

      "text": "Trump’s victory was a boon to Bank of America. Bloomberg News \nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America BAC 1.4423076923076923% Bank of America Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD 22.155 0.315 1.4423076923076923% /Date(1481061600453-0600)/ Volume (Delayed 15m) : 111750736 AFTER HOURS USD 22.16 0.004 0.022568269013766643% Volume (Delayed 15m) : P/E Ratio 18.42851187994998 Market Cap 221104770372.901 Dividend Yield 1.3571590137977834% Rev. per Employee 432244 More quote details and news » BAC in Your Value Your Change Short position ’s chief executive, owes a lot to Donald J. Trump. The president-elect has done what Moynihan has struggled to do: make Bank of America’s stock great again.\nThe shares of America’s second-largest bank by assets (ticker: BAC) are up 20% since the Nov. 8 election, to a record $21, as rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve bode well for the bank’s profits. Also, regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 seem likely to be diluted, if not repealed, under a Trump administration.\nThe rally’s fierceness surprised many investors who thought BofA’s stock would languish until the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates. Worse, it created regrets for those positioned improperly heading into the election. But the proper put-and-call strategy could enable investors to get paid for agreeing to buy Bank of America’s shares at a lower price.\nWhen the stock was selling at $20.33 in late November, investors could sell the January 20 put for 71 cents and buy the January 21 call for 52 cents. The trade credit of 19 cents meant the options market was paying investors for agreeing to buy the stock below $20. The expiration captures fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 13. \nShould the stock advance to, say, $23, the call is worth $2. If the stock falls below $20, investors should buy the stock rather than cover the short put.\nThe risk that the stock will fall far below the put strike price is tempered by the unlikelihood that the yield curve will suddenly flatten. More likely, it will stay firm—or rise—because investors expect Trump to pare postcrisis banking rules that have reduced risk-taking, and arguably profitability, while increasing federal oversight and compliance expenses. While Moynihan won’t comment on the impact of Trump’s victory on Bank of America shares, he is happy to talk about why the bank is positioned to prosper.\n“Our strategy is straightforward: We have to grow; growth has to come by doing more with our customers and clients, with acceptable risk, and in a sustainable fashion over time,” he wrote in an email. “We call that ‘responsible growth,’ and it is the best way to serve our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nMore From Barron’s Byron Wien Ponders the Coming Trump Presidency \n9 Stocks to Short Now \nAMC Entertainment Eyes Blockbuster Stock Returns \nAnalysts are upgrading their earnings models to reflect Trump’s impact on the bank. KBW told clients last week that BofA could have “the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers,” and that “the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates.”\nIn essence, Moynihan might finally get the credit he deserves for having stripped the bank to a muscular core. The moves were necessary: His management team needed every penny available to help BofA recover from its near-death experience in the financial crisis. Now, higher rates and an improving economy mean the bank should make more money.\nThe pending earnings report will tell a lot more than whether Bank of America meets or beats analyst expectations of 32 cents a share in profit on revenue of $21 billion. The recommended options trade suggests that investors will finally give BofA credit for being in fighting trim, and realize its stock is poised to grow nicely from here. \nOIL PRICES SURGED Wednesday on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is limiting production for the first time in eight years, but the options market simply yawned. The lack of action likely reflects concern that the dollar will strengthen, sending crude prices lower.\nInvestors who think oil will trade more on supply issues than the dollar should think about selling puts on ExxonMobil (XOM). With the stock at $87.30, the April 85 put could be sold for $2.91. If the stock advances, investors can keep the premium. Should it decline, they get to buy the stock at an effective price of $82.09. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEVEN SEARS is the author of The Indomitable Investor: Why a Few Succeed in the Stock Market When Everyone Else Fails . \nComments: steve.sears@barrons.com , http://twitter.com/sm_sears \n\nLike Barron’s on Facebook \nFollow Barron’s on Twitter",

      "text": "# Comments One of the suspects cries out in pain while on a stretcher in the Bank of America parking lot. Tania Barricklo — Daily Freeman \nKINGSTON >> A Tuesday afternoon police chase from the town of Ulster to Uptown Kingston ended with two arrests and a long traffic backup on a busy city thoroughfare. \nUlster County sheriff’s deputies responding to an “all points bulletin” from Dutchess County 911 chased an SUV on Routes 199, 209 and 28 in Ulster and Washington Avenue in Kingston before catching the suspects near the Bank of America branch at Washington and Hurley avenues, according to Sheriff Paul VanBlarcum. GALLERY: Photos from the scene \nThe SUV, said to be connected to a larceny in Dutchess County, was spotted at about 3:10 p.m. by an unmarked Ulster County Sheriff’s Office vehicle on state Route 199 in the town of Ulster, VanBlarcum said. When deputies tried to stop the SUV, the driver sped off and headed south onto U.S. Route 209, chased by deputies, state police and town police. \nThe SUV got off Route 209 in the wrong direction, using the northbound exit ramp onto Route 28, struck an object and blew a tire, VanBlarcum said. It was not immediately clear at what point the SUV crossed into oncoming traffic on Route 209. Advertisement \nDriving on only three tires, the SUV took Route 28 to Washington Avenue before finally being stopped by police just north of the Hurley Avenue intersection, where the bank is located. \nOne of the men fled from the SUV and was caught in the bank parking lot, VanBlarcum said. The other stayed in the vehicle and was taken into custody there. \nWith more than 10 police vehicles parked on Washington Avenue at the end of the chase, southbound traffic on the busy road backed up toward the Thruway roundabout. Northbound traffic was able to move past the scene. \nAll traffic was moving again by 4:30 p.m. \nAfter the two suspects were arrested, a plain-clothed officer in the Bank of America parking lot counted cash laid out on a turquoise hoodie beside a black Los Angeles Rams stocking cap, then put the money and other items into evidence bags. Another officer photographed the bills. \nOne of the two suspects sat on the ground in the bank parking lot, handcuffed behind his back. He moaned loudly as he was lifted by officers onto a stretcher. The stretcher was loaded into an ambulance, which left the scene about 3:50 p.m. \nThe other suspect was put into a Sheriff’s Office SUV on Washington Avenue. \nEarly Tuesday evening, Van Blarcum said investigators still were piecing together details of the incident. He did not immediately provide the names of the men arrested or speficy the charges against them. Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $3.00 per week!

      "title": "Police chase from Ulster to Kingston ends with 2 arrests, traffic jam",
      "text": "# Comments One of the suspects cries out in pain while on a stretcher in the Bank of America parking lot. Tania Barricklo — Daily Freeman \nKINGSTON >> A Tuesday afternoon police chase from the town of Ulster to Uptown Kingston ended with two arrests and a long traffic backup on a busy city thoroughfare. \nUlster County sheriff’s deputies responding to an “all points bulletin” from Dutchess County 911 chased an SUV on Routes 199, 209 and 28 in Ulster and Washington Avenue in Kingston before catching the suspects near the Bank of America branch at Washington and Hurley avenues, according to Sheriff Paul VanBlarcum. GALLERY: Photos from the scene \nThe SUV, said to be connected to a larceny in Dutchess County, was spotted at about 3:10 p.m. by an unmarked Ulster County Sheriff’s Office vehicle on state Route 199 in the town of Ulster, VanBlarcum said. When deputies tried to stop the SUV, the driver sped off and headed south onto U.S. Route 209, chased by deputies, state police and town police. \nThe SUV got off Route 209 in the wrong direction, using the northbound exit ramp onto Route 28, struck an object and blew a tire, VanBlarcum said. Advertisement \nIt was not immediately clear at what point the SUV crossed into oncoming traffic on Route 209, which is a divided highway at the Route 28 exit. \nDriving on only three tires, the SUV took Route 28 to Washington Avenue before finally being stopped by police just north of the Hurley Avenue intersection, where the bank is located. \nOne of the men fled from the SUV and was caught in the bank parking lot, VanBlarcum said. The other stayed in the vehicle and was taken into custody there. \nWith more than 10 police vehicles parked on Washington Avenue at the end of the chase, southbound traffic on the busy road backed up toward the Thruway roundabout. Northbound traffic was able to move past the scene. \nAll traffic was moving again by 4:30 p.m. \nAfter the two suspects were arrested, a plain-clothed officer in the Bank of America parking lot counted cash laid out on a turquoise hoodie beside a black Los Angeles Rams stocking cap, then put the money and other items into evidence bags. Another officer photographed the bills. \nOne of the two suspects sat on the ground in the bank parking lot, handcuffed behind his back. He moaned loudly as he was lifted by officers onto a stretcher. The stretcher was loaded into an ambulance, which left the scene about 3:50 p.m. \nThe other suspect was put into a Sheriff’s Office SUV on Washington Avenue. \nEarly Tuesday evening, VanBlarcum said investigators still were piecing together details of the incident. He did not immediately provide the names of the men arrested or specify the charges against them. Subscribe to Home Delivery for only $3.00 per week!

      "title": "Does CEO Succession Planning Matter?",
      "text": "In September 2009, Bank of America CEO Ken Lewis suddenly announced his intention to retire by the end of the year. The company’s board was taken by surprise as it scrambled to find a successor and was further embarrassed as multiple candidates rebuffed the company’s approach. Several delays of self-imposed deadlines and rampant speculation that the company would be forced to choose a stopgap CEO followed. It was only days before Lewis’ departure that the board named Brian Moynihan as the new CEO. This incident highlights that most companies have long been complacent about succession planning. More than half of the respondents in a widely publicized 2010 survey admit that they would not be able to name a successor if the CEO had to leave immediately. [1] \nIn response to such high-profile succession failures, in 2010 the Securities and Exchange Commission issued revised guidance that firms could no longer exclude shareholder proposals related to succession planning from their annual proxy statements. [2] In addition to the SEC, securities analysts and credit rating agencies “heavily weigh” succession planning in their evaluations of firms. Yet, companies tend to resist publicly discussing their succession planning practices, fearing that such disclosure would “result in competitive harm,” “interfere with ordinary business operations,” and present an “attempt to micro-manage the Board of Directors.” [3] \nUsing hand-collected data on succession planning disclosures at public firms undergoing CEO transitions from 1993 to 2010, our recent study, available here , demonstrates how having a formal succession plan affects the nature and efficiency of turnover decisions and the firm’s prospects post-turnover. We document that the percentage of firms that use a formal succession plan to guide management transitions has increased from less than 7 percent in 1993-2003 (pre-Sarbanes Oxley) to almost 22 percent in 2004-2010 (post-Sarbanes Oxley). We show that such firms have a 10 percent lower likelihood of forcing their CEOs out (one-third of the probability of forced CEO turnover in the sample) and 8 percent lower probability of choosing an interim CEO (one-third of the probability of interim CEO succession). Firms with succession plans are also 17 percent more likely to retain their departing CEOs during the transition and significantly less likely to experience departures by non-CEO members of their top management teams. Based on these findings, we argue that succession planning plays a critical role in choosing a successor and ensuring a smooth management turnover.\nSecond, our study finds that succession planning is associated with significantly lower short-term volatility in a company’s stock price around the announcement of CEO turnover as well as lower long-term price volatility over the first year of the successor CEO’s tenure. These effects are stronger especially in cases of voluntary turnover and when the succession plan provides specific details about the CEO transition. We further show that succession planning affects the nature of learning about the incoming CEO’s ability. At firms without succession plans, stock price volatility declines faster in the first year of CEO tenure than in the second or third year, indicating a convex learning curve about CEO ability (as in Pan, Wang, and Weisbach, 2015). In contrast, at firms with succession plans, learning about CEO ability occurs mostly in the first year after the succession.\nThird, our study provides evidence that succession planning improves the efficiency of management transitions. Firms with succession plans have four times higher turnover-performance sensitivity than firms with no succession plans. We also demonstrate that firms with succession plans are less likely to fire their CEOs during recessions, indicating that these firms are less likely to penalize their CEOs for bad industry performance (see Jenter and Kanaan, 2015).\nFinally, our study shows that succession planning affects the pay structure of incoming CEOs. Firms with succession plans pay up to 9 percent less in total compensation to successor CEOs and up to 28 percent less in equity compensation. Thus, succession planning seems to limit the tendency to overpay CEOs. We note that succession planning is also associated with lower post-succession agency costs. Incoming CEOs at firms with formal succession plans have higher sensitivity of their pay to the company’s performance and three times lower share of total compensation as a fraction of the compensation of the five highest-paid executives. These results suggest that succession planning plays an important role in reducing agency conflicts after a CEO succession.\nENDNOTES\n[1] See 2010 Survey on CEO Succession Planning by Heidrick and Struggles, available at\nhttps://www.gsb.stanford.edu/sites/gsb/files/publication-pdf/cgri-survey-2010-ceo-succession.pdf .\n[2] The SEC does not mandate any particular type of succession planning disclosure. As of 2010, only one-third of public companies undergoing CEO turnovers have publicly discussed their succession planning procedures.\n[3] See Form DEF 14-A filed by Whole Foods on Jan. 25, 2010, available at https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/865436/000120677410000109/wholefoods_def14a.htm .\nThis post comes to us from Dragana Cvijanović and Nickolay Gantchev, Professors at the University of North Carolina’s Kenan-Flagler Business School, and Sunwoo Hwang, a Ph.D. candidate at the school.

      "text": "Current stock valuations are creating an increasingly precarious environment for investors. \nThe underlying US economic data currently points in a few possible directions. \nMarket trends will likely depend heavily on policy intricacies that might not be readily apparent. \nHigher interest rates and banking stocks are a possibility if certain trends continue to progress. Market optimism continues to surge in full force and this is creating scenarios that make decisions much more difficult for investors. It can be tempting to engage in the optimism, avoid the fear missing out, and start buying into the highs but this is usually not advisable as these tends to be the situations that generated the biggest losses when constructing portfolio allocations. In this context, Bank of America Corp. (NYSE: BAC ) is no exception. The stock has rallied by roughly 30% since the results of the last presidential election were announced and many investors are looking for added reasons to justify additional moves higher in BAC. Chart View: Bank of America Corp. Chart Source: Gold Traders Generally speaking, stock valuations that move this high/this fast can be a dangerous prospect. But long-term weakness in the US macro data has suggested to many analysts that the Federal Reserve will have limited capacity in raising interest rates . This makes it more difficult for banks to generate upside surprises in earnings releases. But the reality is that there are several areas of strength in the US economy that have fallen under the radar when we look at most of the financial news headlines and these are factors that could send interest rates higher than has been anticipated initially. Chart View: US Services ISM Click to enlarge Chart Source: Gold Traders One of the latest examples of this can be seen in the ISM non-manufacturing activity index, which rose to 57.2 last month. This is the highest reading since October 2015, and the implications here could be drastic given the dominant influence the services sector plays in the broader US economy. This reports only needs to show a reading of 50 in order to signal expansion, so the level of strength here is such that its influence is likely to filter into other, seemingly unrelated aspects of the economy. At this stage, most of the market is expecting the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates at its monetary policy meeting later this month. To gain some perspective here, this is the first rate increase in a year and only the second increase we have seen in the last decade. But if we continue to see positives in these key market components, we are more than likely to see analysts make higher revisions in their interest rate expectations and Bank of America will be one of the key beneficiaries in terms of its market performance. Chart View: US Unemployment Rate Click to enlarge Chart Source: Money Investors Performances in the unemployment rate will also be an critical area to pay attention, given the level of importance that Fed places this data within its overall policy stance. If we can think back to a few years ago, we can remember that the Fed's line in the sand to start raising interest rates held at 5% -- and we are now well below those levels. These trends fall into what many would call the 'full-employment category,' so all of this does make the Fed's job easier when making considerations to tighten economic policy . Risks to this outlook could be seen, however, given the fact that several voting members of the Fed has suggested that a Donald Trump presidency lends itself to significant 'economic uncertainty.' Whether or not this turns out to be true is debatable, but this is clearly something that could inform policy decisions going forward. On balance, the proposed rollbacks in banking regulations and higher interest rates paid when financing infrastructure rebuilding programs should be more than enough to overcome these negatives and send Bank of America to new record highs. Some level of prudence must be exercised here, however, as there could still be potential to establish buys below $20 in the months ahead.

      "text": "Trump’s victory was a boon to Bank of America. Bloomberg News \nBrian Moynihan, Bank of America BAC 1.465201465201465% Bank of America Corp. U.S.: NYSE USD 22.16 0.32 1.465201465201465% /Date(1481061621741-  119053096 AFTER HOURS USD 22.22 0.05 87 0.27075812274368233% Volume (Delayed 15m) : 1736098 P/E Ratio 18.474364318466026 Market Cap 221104770372.901 Dividend Yield 1.3537906137184115% Rev. per Employee 432244   BAC   ’s chief executive, owes a lot to Donald J. Trump. The president-elect has done what Moynihan has struggled to do: make Bank of America’s stock great again.\nThe shares of America’s second-largest bank by assets (ticker: BAC) are up 20% since the Nov. 8 election, to a record $21, as rising bond yields and a steeper yield curve bode well for the bank’s profits. Also, regulations imposed after the financial crisis of 2008-09 seem likely to be diluted, if not repealed, under a Trump administration.\nThe rally’s fierceness surprised many investors who thought BofA’s stock would languish until the Federal Reserve begins raising interest rates. Worse, it created regrets for those positioned improperly heading into the election. But the proper put-and-call strategy could enable investors to get paid for agreeing to buy Bank of America’s shares at a lower price.\nWhen the stock was selling at $20.33 in late November, investors could sell the January 20 put for 71 cents and buy the January 21 call for 52 cents. The trade credit of 19 cents meant the options market was paying investors for agreeing to buy the stock below $20. The expiration captures fourth-quarter earnings on Jan. 13. \nShould the stock advance to, say, $23, the call is worth $2. If the stock falls below $20, investors should buy the stock rather than cover the short put.\nThe risk that the stock will fall far below the put strike price is tempered by the unlikelihood that the yield curve will suddenly flatten. More likely, it will stay firm—or rise—because investors expect Trump to pare postcrisis banking rules that have reduced risk-taking, and arguably profitability, while increasing federal oversight and compliance expenses. While Moynihan won’t comment on the impact of Trump’s victory on Bank of America shares, he is happy to talk about why the bank is positioned to prosper.\n“Our strategy is straightforward: We have to grow; growth has to come by doing more with our customers and clients, with acceptable risk, and in a sustainable fashion over time,” he wrote in an email. “We call that ‘responsible growth,’ and it is the best way to serve our customers and create long-term value for our shareholders.”\nMore From Barron’s Byron Wien Ponders the Coming Trump Presidency \n9 Stocks to Short Now \nAMC Entertainment Eyes Blockbuster Stock Returns \nAnalysts are upgrading their earnings models to reflect Trump’s impact on the bank. KBW told clients last week that BofA could have “the best earnings growth trajectory versus peers,” and that “the valuation is still reasonable given the operating leverage from expense saves and higher rates.”\nIn essence, Moynihan might finally get the credit he deserves for having stripped the bank to a muscular core. The moves were necessary: His management team needed every penny available to help BofA recover from its near-death experience in the financial crisis. Now, higher rates and an improving economy mean the bank should make more money.\nThe pending earnings report will tell a lot more than whether Bank of America meets or beats analyst expectations of 32 cents a share in profit on revenue of $21 billion. The recommended options trade suggests that investors will finally give BofA credit for being in fighting trim, and realize its stock is poised to grow nicely from here. \nOIL PRICES SURGED Wednesday on news that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries is limiting production for the first time in eight years, but the options market simply yawned. The lack of action likely reflects concern that the dollar will strengthen, sending crude prices lower.\nInvestors who think oil will trade more on supply issues than the dollar should think about selling puts on ExxonMobil (XOM). With the stock at $87.30, the April 85 put could be sold for $2.91. If the stock advances, investors can keep the premium. Should it decline, they get to buy the stock at an effective price of $82.09. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSTEVEN SEARS is the author of The Indomitable Investor: Why a Few Succeed in the Stock Market When Everyone Else Fails . \nComments: steve.sears@barrons.com , http://twitter.com/sm_sears \n\nLike Barron’s on   on Twitter",

Giovanni Bruno Dec7,20162:19PMEST \nBank of America Merrill Lynch ( BAC ) managing director Savita Subramanian discussed the 2017 market on CNBC Wednesday afternoon. She laid the foundation for the current 2017 year-end target, the bull case scenario, and the bear case. \n\"Our year-end target for next year is 2,300 on the S&P , which is not that far from where we are today,\" Subramanian said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report.\" She did, however, call the target \"misleading\" because the market has the potential to be one of the best bull markets. \n\"In our bull case scenario, we think the market could go as high as 2,700 on the idea that policy makers deliver,\" she contended. That means fiscal stimulus gets passed, interest rates increase, a cut in taxes and healthy inflation must all take place. \n\"That, I think could put the market in great territory,\" Subramanian added. \"It is predicated on the idea that what has been missing for the last seven years of this bull market is that push out of fixed income into equities.\" \nBut, with her bull case scenario also comes the bear case scenario, in which she hypothesizes the market could go as low as 1,600 on the S&P. \n\"The risks are that policymakers fail to deliver and watching the market reaction over the last month or two suggests that we are focused on the good, but what if we don't get it,\" Subramanian said. \nShould those risks manifest themselves into real problems in which policymakers disappoint, it could result instead in trade wars, and stagflation. \"I think all of that could turn the economy into a recession,\" Subramanian contended. \"It's not our base case, but it's not off the table.\" If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Executive Biographies Biographies and photos of senior Bank of America executives Bank of America Charitable Foundation Provides $1 Million Grant to The Nature Conservancy to Advance Work on Addressing Water Risks \nProviding Opportunities to Protect Free-Flowing Rivers and Increase Coastal Resilience Category: Wednesday, December 7, 2016 12:00 pm EST Dateline: PDF Print RSS \"Today, nations around the world are transforming rivers to meet people’s growing needs for clean water and energy\" \nThe Nature Conservancy (TNC) is the recipient of a $1 million grant from the Bank of America Charitable Foundation, which will support two critical TNC initiatives. The first initiative focuses on using the comprehensive system-scale planning approach to help countries balance the generation of renewable energy and the conservation of rivers that provide food, livelihoods and many other values to people – particularly in Asia, Africa and Latin America. The second program aims to scale up cost-effective investments in nature-based resilience approaches that will help protect communities from climate risks and extreme weather events. \nPartnering to find solutions \nThe grant comes as The Nature Conservancy convenes its 2016 Global Water Summit in New York City December 6-8, where the organization is bringing together experts, partners and practitioners from across the world to develop solutions that can achieve lasting results in preserving the ecological integrity of rivers, lakes and groundwater systems. \n“Today, nations around the world are transforming rivers to meet people’s growing needs for clean water and energy,” said Dr. Michelle Lakly, managing director of the Conservancy’s Saving Rivers Program. “Through ‘smart from the start’ planning with governments, companies and communities, we will influence how the expansion of renewable energy, including hydropower, is developed and managed to ensure the future health of our most critical rivers.” \nHelping communities \nMoreover, three-quarters of all large cities are located on the coast, where rising sea levels and the increasing intensity of storms pose climate-related risks. With Bank of America’s support, TNC’s work demonstrates that a natural infrastructure-based strategy for resilience can help protect millions of the world's most at-risk people, while providing ecological and economic value to their communities. \n\"We know that a healthy coral reef can take down 97 percent of a wave's energy before it crashes to the shore, and that just 100 meters of mangroves can reduce wave height by 67 percent, protecting lives and livelihoods in coastal communities and economies. Simply put, nature reduces risk,” said Kathy Baughman McLeod, managing director for the Conservancy’s Coastal Risk and Resilience Program. “It's a powerful source of resilience, and Bank of America’s recognition of this strategy – that is good for people and good for nature – is spot on.” \n“At Bank of America, we are keenly focused on accelerating the transition to a low-carbon and sustainable economy – from our $125 billion environmental business initiative to our work with pioneering partners like The Nature Conservancy,” said Alex Liftman, Global Environmental executive at Bank of America. “TNC is developing innovative solutions for water security, resilience and other environmental challenges, and these initiatives will benefit our local communities and our planet.” \nAbout The Nature ConservancyThe Nature Conservancy is a global conservation organization dedicated to conserving the lands and waters on which all life depends.
