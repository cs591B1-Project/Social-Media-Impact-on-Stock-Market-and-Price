      "text": "Published November 23, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print   \nNational and local news cycles seem to be dominated by horrific stories of violence and murder. In fact, according to the FBI there were nearly 15,000 murders in 2015 alone, leaving many wondering what’s behind the rise in violent crimes and what can be done to stop it. \nLt. Col. Dave Grossman spent a total of 23 years leading U.S. soldiers and is a former West Point psychology professor who has become a noted scholar and expert on human aggression, violence and killing. Grossman, the author of “Assassination Generation: Video Games, Aggression, and the Psychology of Killing,” believes video games and our media culture can be blamed for the rise in violence in our society. \n“The American Academy of Pediatrics says media violence is the most remediable factor,” Grossman told FoxNews.com. “It’s the one if we did something about it we would have the greatest impact on violence in our society.” \nBeyond the common refrain that our media culture desensitizes us to violence, Grossman said exposing children to the violent imagery depicted in videos games is classic B.F. Skinner operant conditioning, which refers to how human behavior is a result of reinforcement to a stimuli. This conditioning, as Grossman pointed out in his previous book “On Killing,” is how law enforcement and soldiers are trained for combat. \n“Anybody who’s been in the Armed Forces or law enforcement in the last 50 years [knows] you don’t shoot bulls-eye targets, you shoot man-shaped silhouette, a photo realistic target,” Grossman said. \nThe idea behind this training is to make the action an instinctive response to a life-threatening situation. It also trains the brain to overcome the natural aversion to harming or even killing another human being. When children shoot other “humans” in video games it is doing the same kind of conditioning, but without the abundance of training and safeguarding taken with law enforcement and soldiers. \n“The primate goal right now is educating parents and educating children,” Grossman said. He also said that regulating the sale of certain violent video games to minors is important. Grossman firmly believes removing this stimuli can diminish violence. He pointed to a Stanford medical school demonstration that had students in a K-12 school turn off TV, movies and video games for ten days to bolster his point. \n“[It] cut violence in half, cut bullying in half and raised test scores double digits,” Grossman said. \nBrain scans conducted by the Indiana University Medical Department showed a physical change to the brain of teens who are exposed to violent imagery. Grossman’s book highlighted the study that showed a lower use of the logical parts of the brain in those who consumed violent media. These teens had lower activity in the parts of the brain that weigh consequences and make decisions.\nGrossman hopes we can curb violence in the United States by decreasing the use of violent media and imagery. \nHe likened children’s relationship to the video games to an addiction, pointing out how children seemingly undergo a detox period when the games are taken away. \n“The first two days the child is miserable they are going withdrawal symptoms. But on the third day it’s like somebody threw a switch,” Grossman said, adding that the brain changes when exposed to violent imagery.",

      "text": "Twitter says won't let developers make and use surveillance tools November 23, 2016 - 13:35   Twitter has started warning developers that it won't let them use public programming kits or Gnip data for surveillance reasons, whether the clients are law enforcement or anyone else, Engadget reports. \nJust because many tweets are public doesn't mean it's acceptable to harvest them, Twitter says. To that end, it's promising \"expanded\" efforts to crack down on developers who use the data for surveillance reasons. \nTo Twitter, the reasoning is simple: the company is devoted to \"social justice,\" and that's not possible when officials are using these public data sets to track protesters, scoop up people's names and otherwise curb freedom of expression. \nThe policy and resulting crackdown isn't going to stop authorities from collecting information through other means, whether it's old-fashioned searching or some other forms. However, it'll at least make the process harder, Engadget says. Agencies will have to really want that information to get it, and can't just gather it en masse with a simple program. Related links:",

      "text": "Since joining Twitter seven years ago, Donald Trump has tapped out more than 34,000 tweets. That’s an average of more than 11 a day, pretty impressive for a man running a global business empire, fronting a popular TV show, and readying himself to become the 45th president of the United States.\nBut the results of a poll published Tuesday suggest most Americans now want the president-elect to put down his smartphone and focus instead on the job in hand.\nConducted last week by Connecticut-based Quinnipiac University, the national survey found that 59 percent of respondents said Trump should “shut down his personal Twitter account,” while 35 percent opposed the suggestion.\nTrump used his Twitter account to great effect during the presidential campaign, getting his message out to around 13 million followers, with a good number of his straight-talking and combative tweets making headlines around the world. Since winning the November 8 election, his follower count has increased by several million and currently stands at more than 15.8 million.\nLooking at the survey’s findings , Tim Malloy, the poll’s assistant director, said the majority of voters appear to be telling Trump, “You’ve got the job. Now be a leader not a tweeter.”\n“Very restrained” In a 60 Minutes interview following his election victory over Hillary Clinton, The Donald promised to be “very restrained” on Twitter now that he has the top job. However, since then it’s been pretty much business as usual, with Trump regularly taking to the social media service to hit back at critics in his own inimitable way.\nPresident-elect Trump told 60 Minutes ‘ Lesley Stahl that around 28 million people currently follow him on social media sites, describing the services as “a great form of communication.”\n“It does get the word out,” he said in the interview. “When you give me a bad story or when you give me an inaccurate story … I have a method of fighting back.”\nMore: Donald Trump works the internet better than you do (whether he knows it or not)\nIn that case, it’s hard to see Trump quitting his personal Twitter account, and even if he does, he’ll still have the official @POTUS account from which he’ll be able to continue his ongoing conversation with the citizens of the world.\nQuinnipiac University surveyed 1,071 voters nationwide by landline and cell phones from November 17 through 20. The poll has a margin of error of +/- 3 percentage points.\n40 tech companies send letter detailing their policy priorities to President-elect Trump Donald Trump creates a “Crooked Hillary” Snapchat filter, but will it work?

      "text": "Tila Tequila banned from Twitter following neo-Nazi posts The reality star’s account was suspended after she shared an image of a Hitler salute Text Dominique Sisley \nTila Tequila – the reality TV star and former MySpace queen – has had her Twitter account suspended this week following a series of neo-Nazi posts. \nAccording to reports, the social media site blocked Tequila shortly after she shared a picture of her doing a Hitler salute with the caption “Seig heil!”. The image had apparently been taken at a white supremacist (or “alt-right”) gathering in Washington, DC. \nThe tweet was shared on Monday (November 21), and was one of many Nazi-influenced social media posts from the star. Despite being born in Singapore to a Vietnamese family, the Texas-raised Tequila has been vocal about her admiration for both Adolf Hitler and the white nationalist movement. Earlier this month, she responded to Trump’s presidential win by mocking undocumented immigrants; asking her 70,000 Twitter followers whether they were ready to be “rounded up” by the US deportation services, before adding that it may be letting them off “too easy”. \nTequila also tweeted a posthumous “happy birthday” to Hitler back in April – and even went as far as to call the notorious German fascist her “boo” in another post. “Using necromancy to bring my boo Hitler back to life so he can really gas I mean... say hello to everyone,” she joked. In 2013, she shared a photoshopped image on Facebook of her wearing a Nazi armband while standing in front of Auschwitz concentration camp. \nThe social media star has previously denied any allegations of racism, saying in 2015 that was “absolutely not 100 per cent a Nazi supporter”. However, at the time of deletion, her Twitter account bio included the description: “Alt-reich queen! Literally Hitler!” \nDazed has reached out to a representative of Tequila for comment. \nFollow Dominique Sisley on Twitter here @ dominiquesisley Have some news? Let us know on  ",

(REUTERS/Eduardo Munoz) \nSome hazardous toys that have been recalled over the past year are still being sold online, a consumer watchdog group warns in a new report as many families are beginning their holiday shopping.\nOn Tuesday, the Seattle-based WashPIRG Public Interest Research Group Foundation released its 31st annual Trouble in Toyland report, which lists potentially dangerous toys that the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) recalled between January 2015 and October 2016. Unlike car recalls, wherein companies may alert owners based on VIN numbers, toy companies do not notify customers when their products are recalled, according to WashPIRG. Many of the toys listed in this year’s report were recalled for lead, powerful magnets or other hazards.\n“We should be able to trust that the toys we buy are safe,” Bruce Speight, WashPIRG director, said in a news release . “However, until that’s the case, consumers should understand two things: first, not all recalls may be well-publicized so you should check your house for previously recalled toys and second, some toys that are recalled may still be available online.” \nMore on this...

      "text": "By Cameron DaSilva \nPublished November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print The Buffalo Bills have played most of the season without their top receiver, Sammy Watkins. Doing so has been a tall task for a team thin at the position, but the Bills had some success without him. There's no question they'd like to have him on the field, however.\nFortunately, that could happen relatively soon.\nBills GM Doug Whaley announced that Watkins is expected to return to practice Wednesday, which is a step in the right direction.\nMore from FoxSports Keivarae Russell with some Rookie duties | PROCAST #Titans center Ben Jones' bye week plans are on display | PROCAST Oakland Raiders won in Mexico City - Was Colin Cowherd impressed? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF Will Denver Broncos QB Trevor Siemian thrive under pressure? | SPEAK FOR YOURSELF #Bills GM Doug Whaley has announced that Sammy Watkins is anticipated to return to practice today.\n— Buffalo Bills PR (@BuffaloBillsPR) November 23, 2016 That doesn't guarantee that he'll play, of course, but for a guy who's been out since Week 3 with a foot injury, it's good to see him back on the field again. On Tuesday, Rex Ryan was reluctant to give a designation for his star receiver, but like everyone else, he hopes Watkins can play this week.\n\"I'm speaking on behalf of every Buffalo Bills fan: I hope he can play some,\" Ryan said. \nSunday is the earliest Watkins can return, given that he's currently on IR. He'll be the team's one designated player to return, making him eligible for this week's game. With Robert Woods doubtful against the Jaguars after suffering an injury of his own last Sunday, Watkins' return is even more crucial.\nJust don't expect Ryan to activate him before he's ready.",

During that time, anyone trying to access his account--with the handle @Jack--received an error message informing them that the account they were trying to view had been suspended.\nDorsey then tweeted saying “Just setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake),” a call-back to the first ever tweet, “just setting up my twttr,” which he sent on March 21, 2006. His previous tweets have been recovered but his follow count now stands at 2.67 million.\njust setting up my twttr...again (account suspension was an internal mistake)\n— jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \n\nDorsey’s ban follows a Twitter crackdown on far-right accounts, including the white nationalist Richard Spencer, who recently led audience members in a Nazi-style salute during a conference. Spencer described Twitter’s decision to suspend his account as “corporate Stalinism.”\n“They're purging people on the basis of their views,\" he said.\n",

      "text": "Published November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print NEW ORLEANS -- Maybe it is time to break up the New Orleans Pelicans.\nThe surging Pelicans -- who lost nine of their first 10 games to start the season -- own four wins in the past five, raising their record to a more respectable 5-10 entering a Wednesday night game against the 4-9 Minnesota Timberwolves at the Smoothie King Center.\nNew Orleans' 112-94 victory over the 9-5 Hawks at Atlanta on Tuesday night was the Pelicans' most shocking victory during a three-game winning streak.\nMore from FoxSports Thunder Live: OKC nearly makes comeback Thunder Live: OKC heads north to Sacramento Tim Frazier: 'Just came out hungry' Terrance Jones: 'I'm still very sick' Anthony Davis, who entered as the NBA's leading scorer, played just 9 1/2 minutes before banging his right kneecap against a courtside chair while hustling to save a ball from going out of bounds in the first quarter.\nThe Pelicans led 26-14 when Davis limped to the locker room, but even with the All-Star forward getting treatment, New Orleans extended its lead to a season-high 35 points early in the third quarter with a 13-0 run.\nDavis returned for the start of the fourth quarter and finished with 13 points and three blocks in 18 minutes, so it is fairly certain he will play Wednesday night.\n\"He came back out and said that he could go, so we stuck him in the game for a few minutes,\" New Orleans coach Alvin Gentry said Tuesday night. \"We wanted to see if he would OK for tomorrow. We're playing one of the truly gifted players in the league (Karl-Anthony Towns) tomorrow.\"\nThe Wolves are coming off a disappointing 99-93 home loss to the Boston Celtics on Monday night. Minnesota led by 13 points entering the fourth quarter but lost despite 29 points, 18 rebounds, three assists and two blocks by Towns.\n\"Laid a damn egg,\" Wolves guard Zach LaVine said.\nMinnesota was outscored 31-12 in the fourth quarter by the Celtics, including a 17-0 Boston run to start the period. The Wolves did not score their first field goal in the quarter until nearly seven minutes in.\n\"It just shows you can never let your guard down,\" Minnesota coach Tom Thibodeau said. \"You have to strive to be a 48-minute team. We're not doing that right now. We have to get back in, work, concentrate.\n\"We have to improve. We didn't close out. For three quarters, I thought our defense was pretty good. They were shooting a low percentage, the (3-point) line was covered. Rebounding was good. But it doesn't take much for a team to get on track. Once they got a couple, they started getting good looks, and we started scrambling.\"\nTowns is adding to his game by facing up more frequently for jumpers, extending his range beyond the 3-point arc.\nHeading into his matchup with Davis, the other one of the two best young big men in the NBA, Towns is averaging 22.2 points (an increase of four points from last season), 9.2 rebounds, 2.4 assists and 1.3 blocks per game. He is shooting 51.4 percent overall and a 43.1 percent from long range.\nIn dispatching the Hawks on Tuesday night, the Pelicans shot 52 percent from the floor, including 44 percent from long range. Point guard Tim Frazier scored a career-high 21 points and dished out 14 assists.\n\"We just came out and played hard right from the jump,\" Frazier said. \"We made them take tough shots. We shot the ball. All credit to my teammates -- they were able to knock down shots. But we got another one tomorrow. We have to carry the same energy we had today.\"\nThe Pelicans are 3-0 with point guard Jrue Holiday back in the lineup. After missing the first 12 games to be with his wife, who is recovering from a brain tumor, and newborn daughter, Holiday is averaging 19.3 points and 6.7 assists.",

      "title": "Phoenix Suns at Orlando Magic game preview",
      "text": "Published November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print TV: FOX Sports Florida TIME: Coverage begins at 6:30 p.m. ET Can't get to at TV? Watch LIVE on FOX Sports Go\nMore from FoxSports Thunder Live: OKC nearly makes comeback Thunder Live: OKC heads north to Sacramento Tim Frazier: 'Just came out hungry' Terrance Jones: 'I'm still very sick' The Orlando Magic had begun to establish their defensive base. The team was stopping and controlling the Milwaukee Bucks on Monday night, taking as much as a 14-point lead in the first quarter. Orlando was dominant defensively, the way coach Frank Vogel always imagined.\nThe offense was still a work in progress, one of the worst shooting and lowest-scoring offenses in the league, but the defense figured to give the Magic every chance to win.\nThen the turnovers came. One after another, building on top of each other. Undoing all the good work the half-court defense could do.\nMilwaukee was able to get out in transition, beating the Magic before the defense could set. Even the Magic's growing and improving defense could not do enough to prevent its offense's mistakes.\nOrlando committed 19 of its 24 turnovers in the first half, giving up that early lead. The constant mistakes seemed to be magnified the rest of the way as the offense struggled to make shots, as it often has done this season, and the Bucks were in control on their way to a 93-89 win.\n\"It really hurt us a lot,\" point guard Elfrid Payton told the Orlando Sentinel. \"We felt like we were pretty solid in the half court, but those turnovers really hurt us. They were able to get out in transition, and that's what they excel in.\"\nThe Bucks finished with 27 fast-break points and converted 25 points off the Magic's 25 turnovers. In a four-point game with wild swings throughout the second half, those mistakes seemed to amplify late.\nIt marked two straight games in which the Magic struggled with turnovers. Until then, they had done a good job protecting the ball. Orlando is 13th in the league, with turnovers on 14.3 percent of the team's possessions, but the recent aberration has made their rough offense worse.\nIt has done the same too for the Phoenix Suns, putting more stress on an already stressed defense.\nThe Suns give up turnovers on 14.7 percent of possessions and allow 106.3 points per 100 possessions, 25th in the league.\nTurnovers then only put more stress on the Suns. And that is how the Washington Wizards erased a fourth-quarter deficit to score a win Monday at Verizon Center. The Suns had 21 turnovers, leading to 19 Wizards points. Washington had 25 fast-break points in the game.\n\"It was a game we should have won,\" Suns guard Eric Bledsoe told the Arizona Republic. \"We've got to do a better job of execution. There are going to be nights when we can't get out in transition. We can't let that stop us.\"\nThe Wizards broke a late tie and won the game thanks to a career-high 46 points from Bradley Beal. It was much like way the Magic's turnovers helped fuel Giannis Antetokounmpo's first triple-double this season in their loss Monday.\nAs the Suns and Magic meet at Amway Center in Orlando on Wednesday, both will be looking to reduce their turnovers and play to their strengths to pick up a win.",

      "text": "Twitter accidentally suspends CEO Jack Dorsey's account He said it was an internal mistake on Nov 23, 2016, 10:30 AM TechSpot \nImagine being the CEO and co-founder of a social media/news platform and having your own account suspended. That’s the unusual situation Jack Dorsey recently found himself in when Twitter removed him from his own site. \nAt 9 PM yesterday, a number of users reported that Dorsey’s @jack account was showing an error popup with the message: “The account you are trying to view has been suspended.” As you can imagine, this resulted in some confusion as to what had happened, along with speculation that the CEO could have been hacked. \nAbout 15 minutes later, Dorsey’s account was fully restored, though he had lost a large number of his followers. At 11 PM, the Twitter boss posted a message addressing the suspension: “just setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake),” referencing his first ever tweet from 2006. just setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake) —jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \nIt’s not been a good month for Dorsey and Twitter. He was forced to apologize after an ad promoting a white supremacist group appeared on the platform last week. Worst of all, the promoted tweet was discovered just hours after Twitter introduced a handful of new tools designed to combat abuse on the microblogging site. \nTwitter recently banned a number of “alt-right” users, including head of the National Policy Institute, Richard Spencer, which resulted in anti-free speech claims. Some white supremacist groups have threatened to create “fake black people” accounts in retaliation. \nWhile Dorsey is blaming an internal mistake for the temporary suspension, there’s always the chance that his account really was compromised and he doesn’t want to admit to it. If so, he would join other high-profile CEO hack victims, such as Mark Zuckerberg and Google's Sundar Pichai . Related Reads",

      "text": "Twitter plans crackdown on developers & organizations exploiting data for surveillance   08:33 am PT (11:33 am ET) Over the next several months, Twitter will embark on a crackdown on developers building surveillance tools to track protesters and activists, the company said this week in announcement. Using Twitter's public APIs and Gnip enterprise data for surveillance is already banned under official terms, and can lead to suspensions or outright termination of access to the material, the company noted . To address abuse cases, it's planning \"expanded enforcement and compliance efforts,\" among them dedicating more resources to investigating and acting on complaints. Twitter has often been used by dissidents, some examples being uprisings in Egypt, Iran, Tunisia, and Ukraine, as well as more persistent movements like anti-corporate protests or Black Lives Matter. As the social network has expanded though, various firms have created tools that can be used to monitor people —including trends and locations —and supply that data to law enforcement and spy agencies, chilling the ability to speak out. In October Twitter suspended one such firm, Geofeedia, from access to its commercial data, after the American Civil Liberties Union called attention to police using the material to monitor protesters against police violence in Baltimore and Ferguson. Earlier in 2016, it tried to limit U.S. spy agencies' data access through a firm called Dataminr. Twitter has struggled to find its footing in the past year, thanks to high-profile departures and investor concerns about its ability to grow and turn a profit. However, on Tuesday night, the company accidentally temporarily suspended the account of its own CEO , Jack Dorsey. Topics:",

      "text": "Published November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre 0 Email Print AP Photo/Richard Shiro \nBy Michael Guillen Ph.D.   \nPublished November 23, 2016  | FoxNews.com \n\nAs our nation segues from a rancorous election season to a day of thanksgiving, I wish to speak up for gratitude and optimism. And for a change agent exceedingly more influential than any politician who’s ever lived.\nNovember 8th, the pundits keep telling us, was a “change election.” Yet despite the rhetoric of change from both political parties, the misdeeds of Man remain nearly identical to those we read about in the Old Testament.\nThankfully, however, authentic change is possible. I’ve witnessed it in myself and in others, and it oftentimes begins with a crisis.\nTake my friend Melody Rossi. In the 1980s she was an award-winning professional singer who performed with opera companies and symphonies all over the country. But in 1994 a routine surgery went badly, leaving her bedridden for nearly a year. Worse, it ended Melody’s singing career and left her unable to have kids.\nTo earn a living, she began substitute teaching in Southern California’s San Fernando Valley. Time and again, not because she wanted it, she was assigned to schools in high-crime neighborhoods. Eventually, she became a fulltime teacher at one of the most underprivileged of them all.\nDuring her convalescence, Melody had begun a serious study of the Bible. Of special significance to her now as a teacher were the words attributed to Jesus in the book of Matthew: “Truly I tell you, whatever you did for one of the least of these brothers and sisters of mine, you did for me.”\nIt broke Melody’s heart to watch decent, hard-working kids at her school being forced to join street gangs and use and deal drugs. Acting on her motto “If you don’t like it, change it!”, she started an after-school program at a local church, where students could get help with homework and socialize in a safe, wholesome environment.\nToday, Melody’s after-school program is a thriving ministry called Cloud & Fire.  Every year, it helps more than 500 low-income, urban kids – including pregnant girls – graduate from high school. A few years ago I had the honor of being the Cloud & Fire commencement speaker; the experience remains one of the highlights of my life.\nMelody explains that Cloud & Fire is changing lives because it gives young people three things, in this order: first, it helps them with their schoolwork and broken lives; second, it offers them a safe, authentic community; and lastly, it introduces them to Jesus and the Bible.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

Olympic organizers say they want to return about $3 million in ticket refunds to people who returned their tickets. They say they have the money, but are having trouble paying people back due to missing bank details, etc. According to organizers, about 90 percent of refunds have already been made. (AP Photo/Felipe Dana, File)  (Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.) \nOlympic organizers in Rio de Janeiro are trying to hand over almost $3 million in ticket refund payments due to 13,000 people.\nOne big problem. They can't find them.\n\"We are hunting after people,\" Rio spokesman Mario Andrada told The Associated Press on Wednesday. \"We have the money, but don't know how to get it to them.\"\nRio organizers allowed buyers to return tickets, which were resold.\n\"Instead of selling them to scalpers, they gave the tickets back to us, and we resold them,\" Andrada said.\nMore On This...

Fox News executives were in attendance, but they wouldn't comment since it was an off the record briefing.\n\"We're in a room full of liars, the deceitful, dishonest media who got it all wrong,” Trump told the gathering at Trump Tower, according to the New York Post.\nHANNITY: TRUMP MUST IGNORE MEDIA, HOLLYWOOD HATERS AND LISTEN TO BACKERS Trump reportedly took direct aim at CNN president Jeff Zucker, calling everyone at the network liars and saying Zucker should be ashamed of himself.\nThe president-elect didn't stop there. He reportedly hit NBC News for its coverage of his campaign and slammed ABC News's Martha Raddatz, who was brought to near tears on air election night.\nI'm sure some in the room had their little feelings hurt, but really, who cares? Didn't they deserve every bit of what Trump said to them? Keep in mind, some of these so-called unbiased journalists laughed off Donald Trump and said he never stood a chance years before he even decided to run for president. And they each had to eat their words.\nAs for President-elect Trump’s meeting with The New York Times, I'm sure the self-described “paper of record” was trying to smooth things over with Mr. Trump, and gloss over its unrelenting negative coverage of his campaign.\nMr. Trump should keep in mind that a few days before this meeting the Times praised former Obama adviser and current CNN contributor Van Jones as a \"star\" of the 2016 campaign. That would be the same Van Jones who was a member of the alt-radical left and who viciously attacked Donald Trump on a consistent basis throughout the campaign.\nRead the full story in the Opinion section on FoxNews.com→",

      "title": "Mike Pence Calls ‘Hamilton’ a ‘Real Joy’ After Donald Trump Claims VP-Elect Was ‘Harassed’ at Broadway Show",
      "text": "President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter this weekend to slam the wildly popular Broadway musical, Hamilton, but vice president-elect Mike Pence didn't seem to share the same sentiment.\nPence attended a performance of the Tony-award winning production on Friday night, where he was called out by Brandon V. Dixon -- who portrays America's first treasury secretary and the third vice president, Alexander Hamilton -- at the end of the show in a statement that was written by the cast and the show's creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda, and producer Jeffrey Seller, according to Broadway.com.\n\"We, sir, we are the diverse America who are alarmed and anxious that your new administration will not protect us, our planet, our children, our parents, or defend us and uphold our inalienable rights,\" Dixon declared after thanking the vice president-elect for attending. \"We truly hope that this show has inspired you to uphold our American values and to work on behalf of all of us.\"\nWATCH: Megyn Kelly Says Daughter Was 'Afraid of Donald Trump,' Recalls 'Security Issues'\n\"I really enjoyed watching Hamilton ,\" Pence told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace during a pre-taped appearance. \"It was a real joy to be there. I heard a few boos. I wasn't offended by what was said.\"\nTrump, however, responded differently to the statement and expressed his disapproval on Twitter. \"Our wonderful future V.P. Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton , cameras blazing,\" he tweeted on Saturday morning. \"This should not happen!\"\nWATCH: President Obama Talks to Daughters Sasha and Malia About Trump -- 'Fight for Treating People With Kindness'\n\"The theater must always be a safe and special place,\" he continued in another post. \"The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence. Apologize!\"\nThe cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Trump also tweeted out his disapproval of Alec Baldwin making his return to Saturday Night Live to portray the president-elect. This was Baldwin's first time impersonating Trump since he beat Hillary Clinton in the presidential election.\n\"I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night,\" Trump tweeted in response to the episode. \"It is a totally one-sided, biased show -- nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\"\nI watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night. It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all. Equal time for us?\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 Baldwin quickly responded to Trump's post with a series of tweets. \"Equal time? Election is over. There is no more equal time. Now you try to be Pres + people respond. That's pretty much it,\" the 56-year-old actor wrote. \"You know what I would do if I were Prez? I'd be focused on how to improve the lives of AS MANY AMERICANS AS POSSIBLE.\"\nWATCH: Wait, Is Kanye West REALLY a Donald Trump Supporter? -- See the Rapper's Democratic Campaign Contributions\n\"I'd be focused on improving our reputation abroad, including actually fighting for freedom and not just oil,\" he added. \"I would make every effort to retrain Americans so to create jobs. One way you make America great again is to put it back to work. ...I would make appointments that encouraged people, not generate fear and doubt.\"\nBaldwin concluded his Twitter rant: \"@realDonaldTrump, I could go on. You want more advice, call me. I'll be at SNL .\"\nRelated Articles\nAriel Winter Snaps Sexy Swimsuit Selfie Jenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Kendall Jenner Stuns in Lace-up Catsuit",

      "text": "Mazda rotary engine returning in 2019 Published November 23, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print (Mazda) \nThe Wankel rotary engine could return to a Mazda car as early as 2019, but it won’t be spinning its wheels. \nCarsGuide reports that Mazda’s head of research and development, Kiyoshi Fujiwara, has confirmed that the automaker will launch its first electric car in 2019, and said that it will likely use a small rotary engine as a range extending electricity generator for when the battery runs out of charge. Related Image Expand / Contract Mazda EV prototype (Mazda) \nMazda has demonstrated a prototype of this type of series-hybrid vehicle before, and the powertrain configuration is currently in use in several cars, including the BMW i3 REx, which has a two-cylinder reciprocating engine onboard. \nThe appeal of the rotary in this application is the high power density afforded by its compact design, and its smooth-running nature. Fujiwara said Mazda is developing the EV itself, rather than collaborating with a major automaker that already builds them. \nSPIN: MAZDA'S ROTARY ENGINE MAKES A 180-DEGREE TURN \nMazda last built a car powered by a rotary engine in 2012, the RX-8, but had to abandon it largely to poor fuel efficiency and emissions. It has continued to work on the technology, however, as it is one of the company's signature features. Mazda officials have previously suggested that if they can get it to perform as well as a reciprocating engine, it will bring it back to power a conventional sports car, too.",

      "text": "\nJack Dorsey, Twitter’s co-founder and CEO, was left red-faced after his own social media platform suspended his verified account. Dorsey’s account may have disappeared for less than an hour, but he lost more than a couple of million followers.\nThe Twitter account belonging to Jack Dorsey vanished briefly Tuesday night before reappearing within half an hour. While the time was brief, Dorsey lost more than two million followers. Any attempts to visit Jack Dorsey’s verified account around 9 p.m. E.S.T were futile. The dreaded “This account has been suspended” message scrolled across Dorsey’s page must have undoubtedly shocked his followers who numbered in the millions.\nHAHAHA @Jack Dorsey got suspended from his own platform \nMEME MAGIC IS REAL FOLKS ???? pic.twitter.com/vCb4Lbwuno \n— Baked Alaska™ (@bakedalaska) November 23, 2016 \n\nBefore suspension, Dorsey had close to 4 million followers to his Twitter account. However, when his account, replete with the highly coveted “verified” badge, resurfaced, Dorsey had to begin his fan following afresh. Those who kept on refreshing the page, managed to catch Dorsey’s account with just 142 followers , reported Cnet.\nDorsey later tweeted the suspension was an “internal mistake.” Without offering any explanation he merely joked about the incident: “just setting up my twttr…again.” He was referring to the first tweet that was sent on the platform, by him, about 10 years ago.\njust setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake)\n— jack (@jack) November 23, 2016 \n\nAlthough the count had risen substantially, and may soon cross 620K, it will take some time before it manages to cross 4 million. Some social media users wondered if Dorsey could ever manage to get as many followers before the accidental suspension. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal claimed Dorsey’s 3.8 million follower count was restored , but the account doesn’t seem to reflect the same.\nWhy was Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey’s account suspended? It isn’t clear why the account was suspended or what caused the account to vanish or the drastic shrinkage in followers. Twitter’s representatives haven’t offered any explanation about the bizarre incident involving none other than their top boss.\nTwitter CEO and co-founder Jack Dorsey says the social media platform accidentally suspended his account. https://t.co/A0azgTPx0E #odd \n— AP Oddities (@AP_Oddities) November 23, 2016 \n\nTwitter users can choose to disappear from the micro-blogging social media platform. While the users can deactivate their own account on Twitter, only the platform reserves the right to suspend them. Normally, Twitter choses to take down any account on a temporary basis following a barrage of complaints by users.\nNormally when a high number of users “flag” an account the platform deems them to be either sending spam or abusive tweets. The suspension can last for a few days or can be permanent depending on the algorithms Twitter employs to judge how bad the account is. Apart from the tweets, Twitter can also suspend accounts it believes have been hacked or compromised. According to Twitter’s blog post, the platform has been very strict about its data usage policy . The company noted Tuesday that it was “Absolutely unacceptable and prohibited for developers to track or profile protesters or activists on Twitter.”\nThe CEO of Twitter, Jack Dorsey, has been suspended and now nothing makes sense pic.twitter.com/PwHp5rjES1 \n— Jared Wyand (@JaredWyand) November 23, 2016 \n\nTwitter has been getting stricter with accounts, and was observed to be eager to suspend those which the platform claimed violated its rules. However, it is unlikely any of these reasons can justify suspension of Jack Dorsey’s account.\nSocial media experts believe Dorsey’s account might have been suspended because of a security threat. Earlier this year, several high profile and verified accounts on Twitter, and some other platforms as well, were compromised by a team of organized hackers who call themselves OurMine. The group managed to gain access to some pretty big accounts that belonged to Google CEO Sundar Pichai, Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg, Spotify’s founder and CEO Daniel Ek, among a few other prominent personalities. The team claimed it had no ill-intention, but merely wanted to highlight the multiple vulnerabilities of the platforms they had compromised. Interestingly, the group had been trying to peddle their digital security services that promised to fortify the social media accounts against further attacks.\n[Update] It appears the glitch eroded some more followers. Jack Dorsey’s follower count is slowly climbing upwards.\n[Featured Image by Drew Angerer/Getty Images]\nTwitter CEO Gets His Own Account Suspended: Jack Dorsey’s Follower Count Plummets By A Few Million Due To Internal Glitch [Update] is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Published November 23, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print The complete rare jug after being restored in the laboratories of the Israel Antiquities Authority. (Photographic credit: Clara Amit) \nA group of high school students participating in an archaeological excavation in Israel expected to uncover artifacts from long-ago civilizations buried deep in the ground. But what they found went far beyond the routine fragments of pottery, instruments and bones they anticipated.\nThe students, digging in the city of Yehud prior to the construction of residential buildings, helped uncover a nearly 4,000-year-old jug with the sculpture of a person sitting on top of it, a Middle Bronze Age artifact archaeologists said was unlike anything they’d ever seen.\n“Suddenly I saw many archaeologists and important people arriving who were examining and admiring something that was uncovered in the ground” said Ronnie Krisher, one of the students who participated in the dig, in a statement.\nCHRIST’S TOMB UNCOVERED: THIS IS WHAT EXPERTS DISCOVERED \n“They immediately called all of us to look at the amazing statuette and explained to us that this is an extremely rare discovery and one that is not encountered every day,” she said.\n“It literally happened on the last day of the excavation,” said the excavation director, Gilad Ilatch. “… right in front of our eyes and those of the excited students, an unusual ceramic vessel c. 18 cm high (7 inches) was exposed, atop of is the image of a person….\n“The level of precision and attention to detail in creating this almost 4,000-year-old sculpture is extremely impressive. The neck of the jug served as a base for forming the upper portion of the figure, after which the arms, legs and a face were added to the sculpture….\n3,800-YEAR-OLD 'TABLEAU' OF EGYPTIAN BOATS DISCOVERED \n  \n“It is unclear if the figure was made by the potter who prepared the jug or by another craftsman.”\nThe excavators also uncovered daggers, an ax head, arrowheads, sheep bones, fragments of pottery vessels, flint and basal implements and a butter churn. They believe the items were buried as funerary offerings for an important member of the Chalcolithic Period settlement.\nBut the vessel with the sculpture on top was the piece de resistance .\nREMNANTS OF 'SIGNIFICANT' BRONZE-AGE CITY DISCOVERED IN IRAQ \n“To the best of my knowledge, such a rich funerary assemblage that also includes such a unique pottery vessel has never before been discovered in the country,” said Efrat Zilber, supervisor of the Land of Israel and Archaeology program, a course of studies offered by the Israel Antiquities Authority and Ministry of Education to help train future archaeologists.",

(Photo: Brian Ach, Getty Images for TechCrunch) \nSAN FRANCISCO — Twitter's new chief operating officer Anthony Noto has been awarded an annual compensation package of $12 million a year. \nThe struggling social media service made the announcement in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission late Wednesday. \nNoto, the company's chief financial officer, is replacing longtime Twitter executive Adam Bain, who announced his departure earlier this month. \nNoto is receiving a total of 940,000 restricted stock units and 325,00 performance-based restricted stock units. The new stock package vests over a four-year period. \nIf he's fired, Noto will get 100% of his $250,000 base salary in severance. He had been entitled to 50% of his base salary. \nTwitter is looking for a new CFO to replace Noto, who is serving as COO and interim CFO. \nNoto's compensation has raised eyebrows in the past. In 2014 when he was hired from Goldman Sachs, he pulled down $72.8 million. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2ghp7e7",

      "text": "The chief executive of Twitter had his account briefly suspended because of what he said was an “internal mistake.”\nJack Dorsey , who co-founded the social network in 2006, was locked out of his account, which had 3.9 million followers, for about 15 minutes on Tuesday night. During that time, anyone trying to access his account—with the handle @Jack—received an error message informing them that the account they were trying to view had been suspended.\nDorsey then tweeted saying “Just setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake),” a call-back to the first ever tweet, “just setting up my twttr,” which he sent on March 21, 2006. His previous tweets have been recovered but his follow count now stands at 2.67 million.\njust setting up my twttr…again (account suspension was an internal mistake)\n— 🚶🏽jack (@jack) November 23, 2016\nDorsey’s ban follows a Twitter crackdown on far-right accounts, including the white nationalist Richard Spencer, who recently led audience members in a Nazi-style salute during a conference. Spencer described Twitter’s decision to suspend his account as “corporate Stalinism.”\n“They’re purging people on the basis of their views,” he said.",

Balamuralikrishna Kamal Haasan has three national awards and a good number of hits in both south Indian and north Indian cinema - he's a star in his own right. But KRK or Kamaal Rashid Khan clearly doesn't think so. By: FE Online | Published: November 24, 2016 4:40 PM Kamal has not replied to the insulting tweet, probably because he’s busy filming his latest project Shabaash Naidu, which is a tri-lingual film. (Indian Express) \nKamal Haasan has three national awards and a good number of hits in both south Indian and north Indian cinema – he’s a star in his own right. But KRK or Kamaal Rashid Khan clearly doesn’t think so. When veteran Carnatic musician M. Balamuralikrishna passed away earlier this week, Kamal was one of the many people who took to Twitter to express his grief. “81 yrs Mahaguru Dr. Balamurali enthralled millions with music.Thanks 2 technology even death cant silence his voice. Pranam guruji & goodbye,” he tweeted. And that’s precisely when KRK thought it was appropriate to insult the actor out of the blue. “Mr. @ikamalhaasan you have only 367000 followers, means you are Chai Cum Paani compare to Me Me Me the no. 1 critic and superstar KRK,” he wrote. \nKamal has not replied to the insulting tweet, probably because he’s busy filming his latest project Shabaash Naidu, which is a tri-lingual film, according to a Deccan Chronicle report. Or another reason could be that he’s just not bothered by KRK or his opinions. However, fans of the actor reacted immediately to the tweet, calling KRK insensitive, not just because he attacked Kamal for no apparent reason, but also because he chose to mock a condolence tweet. Here are a few Twitter posts: @kamaalrkhan Jitne tere pass teeth hai usse jyada awards hai @ikamalhaasan sir ke pass. U low life #Krk \n— Yogesh Jadhav (@yogjadhav11) November 22, 2016 @kamaalrkhan @ikamalhaasan u got followers only n twitter. But he’s a living legend having millions of followers in real life.

      "text": "World News | Thu Nov 24, 2016 | 3:24pm GMT Seven-year-old Syrian girl takes to Twitter to depict life in Aleppo left right A general view shows the damage at a site hit by airstrikes in the rebel-held besieged al-Qaterji neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria November 23, 2016. REUTERS/Abdalrhman Ismail 1/2 Smoke rises from a rebel held neighbourhood of Aleppo, Syria November 17, 2016. REUTERS/Abdalrhman Ismail 2/2 \nHer hair tied into pigtails by matching pink ribbons, seven-year-old Bana Alabed inspects the rubble in her home town of Aleppo, before walking to face the camera. \n\"I am sad. It's so bad,\" she tells her audience in English in a clip posted on Twitter. She is later seen holding a banner reading: \"Stand with Aleppo. Please stop the bombing and end the siege.\" \nThe video, posted on Tuesday and accompanied by the text \"checking in the morning after a night of bombing\" is the latest the young girl has shared with her nearly 94,000 Twitter followers depicting life in the war-torn Syrian city. \nHer account gives a poignant human face to a nearly six-year conflict pitting President Bashar al-Assad against rebels seeking to oust him, in which hundreds of thousands of people have been killed and millions forced from their homes. \nRenewed air strikes, after a pause that lasted several weeks, have worsened conditions in Aleppo's rebel-held east, where residents are short of food, medicine and fuel. \nOn her Twitter account, which is managed by her mother, Alabed shares pictures of the city's bombed buildings and of herself at home. \n\"Good afternoon from #Aleppo I'm reading to forget the war,\" she said in one post showing Alabed with a book and a doll. A picture posted on Thursday of smoke in the sky had the caption \"Good morning from #Aleppo. We are still alive. - Bana.\" \nAsked about what they hoped to achieve, Alabed's mother Fatemah, told Reuters via Twitter in English: \"Effort to show people our (lives) so they can act. We only tweet what we think of. The video is near our home, our neighbourhood (is) in ruin\". \nThe seven-year-old's tweets have gained attention from at least one prominent user of the micro-blogging site. \nWhen Fatemah tweeted \"Harry Potter\" author J.K. Rowling about her daughter wanting to read one of her stories, the writer and her agent quickly responded. \nFatemah said Alabed had since received \"Harry Potter\" ebooks and would start reading them. Alabed tweeted her thanks with a picture to which the author replied: \"Love you too, Bana! Thinking of you, keep safe #Aleppo\". \n(Reporting by Francesca Lynagh and Marie-Louise Gumuchian; Editing by Robin Pomeroy) Next In World News Kurds, Shi'ite fighters to coordinate after sealing off Mosul \nERBIL/BAGHDAD, Iraq Iraqi Kurdish and Shi'ite forces agreed to coordinate movements after cutting off Mosul from the rest of the territory held by Islamic State in western Iraq and Syria in support of a U.S-backed offensive to capture the city, U.S. and Iraqi officials said on Thursday.",

      "text": "Twitter 0 \nMercedes-Benz CLA, the highly-popular saloon from the German luxury carmaker, will receive its first major makeover in India. Scheduled to be launched on 30 th November 2016, the new Mercedes-Benz CLA facelift will be the carmaker’s 12 th product which are being promised for this year. Similar to the current model, the updated model of the sedan will be assembled at Mercedes-Benz India’s Chakan plant. \nFirst previewed at this year’s New York International Auto Show, the 2017 Mercedes CLA facelift receives modish design updates making it look refresh and premium. While the saloon retains the exuberant styling, the revised smoked headlamps with full-LED lights, re-designed bumper with larger air intakes mark a distinction. \nRead More About – Mercedes-Benz C Class Cabriolet and S-Class Cabriolet \nThe new CLA has ditched the 5-spoke alloys, and comes fitted with multi-spoke alloy wheels similar to the CLA AMG. Towards the rear, one can notice the revised bumper with an integrated flush. \nWhen it comes to the interior, the 2017 Mercedes CLA facelift offers a few new connectivity features including Mercedes’ COMAND system, an 8-inch infotainment system and an updated instrument cluster with read needles. The new upholstery adds a sporty touch to its appearance. Picture Gallery – Mercedes AMG SLC 43 \nHowever, things remain unchanged under the hood. The 2017 Mercedes CLA facelift continues to source its power from the same 2.0-litre petrol and 2.1-litre, 4-cylinder diesel motors. The former punches out 181bhp with 300Nm, and the latter one offers 134bhp against 300Nm. For transmitting power to the front wheels is the same 7-speed automatic gearbox. \nWith aforementioned cosmetic and features updates, the 2017 Mercedes-Benz CLA facelift prices could see a marginal hike. In the luxury sedan segment, the updated CLA will go up against the Skoda Superb , Toyota Camry and Audi A3. \nAbout the Author : Chhavi Kaushik Post A Query or Comment Your email address will not be published.

      "text": "deadmau5, who took to Twitter this week to complain about his own forthcoming album, just shared a hip-hop track graced by rapper Manchester grime MC Shotty Horroh. Grime is usually pretty, er, grimy, and deadmau5 is usually pretty on edge with the synths and all meandering with the beat. These were the things swirling in my mind as I pressed play.\nAll of a sudden, I hear this dreamy, vinyl-popping \"dee, dee, dee, dee, doo\" like the soundtrack to an early 1960s claymation family Christmas. Then the headbangin' beat drops, not meandering at all, and the synths are somehow subdued under Holloh's cool, calm, and calamitous delivery. But when Holloh takes a break, you hear the signature deadmau5 sound clawing through in that counter melody.\nIf you'd had played this track without telling me it was deadmau5, I would have wanted to know immediately. The star power was not necessary, and it's got me real excited to see what other surprises deadmau5 has in store for 2017.\n\"Okay.\" (Sorry it's a stream rip) ft. @ShottyHorroh https://t.co/CzOHesbTgz\n- dead mow cinco (@deadmau5) November 22, 2016",

A caller told him that his primary opponent, the current MP, has been giving out roof repair stuff - plywood etc, to all in the constituency but, sir, what have you been doing? The FNM candidates’ reply before the storm we gave out sand-bags... We are preparing a development plan! He better get to know what politics Bahamian-style is all about - Matthew brought all early into testing their pockets. Voters are watching. New License plates and discs - so I get stopped, how do the Police have proof that the car I am driving is actually mine? Have the Police been provided with a mobile bar code reader or do they have to take my word? You know this thing cost $8m should have all the bells and whistles. Is the Police computer online to the Road Traffic? My bet because none of the others aren’t it isn’t... wow $8m! West Bay Street coming to Goodman’s Bay roundabout turn off to Prospects can’t PWD limit traffic in the right lane going east to only traffic that is turning at the roundabout? Boy people think this stretch of West Bay is a race track. Minister Davis really thinks the PLP Government since 2012 did something to reduce the price of electricity? Boy some think we real stupid! Tourism - direct flight from France to San Sal - lord be with us how stupid these officials are - we spent $21m building an airport to take long range jets years ago - what’s the fuss? B FERGUSON",

      "text": "Congress president Sonia Gandhi's political secretary Ahmed Patel took to Twitter this morning, urging users of the social networking service to listen to the \"voice of reason\". \nDo listen to Dr Manmohan Singh's remarks, a voice of reason and logic in an impetuous environment of rhetoric and gimmicks,\" he tweeted. \n\"The country should pay heed to what Manmohan Singh says because there is nobody in the history of independent India with such credentials in economic administration as he has. He does not only have academic understanding of the economy but is one person who has been part of the system for decades,\" Ramesh said. \nManmohan was the chief economic adviser to the Government of India, he was the finance secretary, RBI governor, deputy chairperson of the Planning Commission, finance minister and, finally, the Prime Minister,\" he added. \nSix characters rolled into one. All this, apart from being a renowned economist. Moreover, he was the finance secretary when the Morarji Desai government demonetised currency notes of Rs 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 in 1978.\" \n\"monumental mismanagement, organised loot and legalised plunder\", Congress leaders ran amok with the \"trophies\", hawking them as a vindication of the Opposition stand on the demonetisation drive. \n\"uses his words with extreme caution, not like today's Prime Minister\". \nHe speaks infrequently, has a feeble voice and doesn't resort to drama- bazi (theatrics) and false rhetoric. But his are thoughtful expressions, reflecting experience of 50 years.\" \nRamesh said it was well known that Singh doesn't speak\" unless he is \"hundred per cent\" convinced. \"Modi should listen to his views instead of relying on WhatsApp surveys. He should pay heed to serious critique from a person who knows the system, the economy and governance. If he says farmers will be hurt, small businesses will be affected and workers of unorganised sectors will suffer... the government should wake up.\" \nAsked what the former Prime Minister meant by organised loot\" and \"legalised plunder\", Ramesh told The Telegraph : \"These expressions describe how bad and thoughtless the decision was. That he put 96 per cent innocent citizens in peril because of four per cent corrupt.... He (Singh) also suggested information was leaked to the Prime Minister's friends and there is a possibility the poor man's cash will be used in loan write-offs and political largesse.\" \nRahul Gandhi, who also tweeted about Singh's speech, said: The myth of fascist efficiency lies shattered by the Prime Minister's incompetence.\" \nAsked about finance minister Arun Jaitley's stinging response that maximum black money was generated during Singh's regime, Ramesh said: We will reply to Jaitley's points in Parliament but he should tell the nation how the Saurabh Patel scam happened in Gujarat. Patel was minister of state (for petrochemicals and energy), but who was the cabinet minister when the scam happened? Modi himself, who was also the Gujarat chief minister then. No investment was possible without Modi's approval and who is responsible for the GSPC scandal?\" \nThe Congress has accused Patel of having financial interests in offshore firms. Reports regarding this appeared in the media last week. \nThe Congress has also held Modi responsible for the mess in the Gujarat State Petroleum Corporation. The GSPC has run up a Rs 20,000-crore debt because of alleged unwise investments, for which the Congress bl \nThese are indications that the Congress has sharpened its tool and there is no question of reconciliation in the coming days. While the Lok Sabha did not function even today, the Rajya Sabha was disrupted after an hour's work as the Prime Minister chose not to return to the House after the lunch recess. \nAsked if the Congress was looking for excuses to disturb Parliament, Ramesh said: Anger is swelling up every day on the streets but Parliament is disturbed because of the Prime Minister.\" \nRamesh added: The BJP did not allow Parliament to function demanding then Prime Minister Manmohan Singh's presence when the coal scam was debated. On August 30, 2013, when the ruckus started, our minister Rajiv Shukla said Manmohan Singh was sitting in the House for one hour. Venkaiah Naidu then said, 'so what'? Ravi Shankar Prasad insisted only the Prime Minister can clarify although Manmohan Singh held the coal portfolio for a brief period. We are applying the same principle.\" \nRamesh said demonetisation was a one-man decision, implemented and complimented by Modi alone. He has spoken about it in public rallies. Now why should he not be present in Parliament during the debate and answer questions? Had he not gone away today, the debate would have folded up by now.\" Singh",

Twitter declined comment, but noted its policies against hate speech and harassment. \nSome supporters of the movement cheered Dorsey's brief suspension with celebratory tweets Tuesday.

The note was posted with an image of a USA Today article stating that \"Twitter's alt-right ban may backfire.\"\nSince @Twitter is now in the #censorship business, I will no longer use its service for my constitutional right to free speech. #GoodbyeAll pic.twitter.com/bismJDb3wh\n- James Woods (@RealJamesWoods) November 18, 2016\nWoods, whose personal accounts boasts 484,000 followers, also updated his bio to read: \"Twitter has now sadly abdicated its position as a sole beacon of free speech. Voltaire's famous dictum has been quietly buried by these left wing savages.\"\nTwitter's alt-right ban was put into action after the group - often criticized for supporting white nationalism, homophobia and anti-semitism - helped seal Donald Trump's victory in the presidential election.\nIn a statement to The Hollywood Reporter emailed Wednesday, a Twitter spokesperson said, \"The Twitter rules prohibit violent threats, harassment, hateful conduct, and multiple account abuse, and we will take action on accounts violating those policies.\"\nAccounts that were suspended Tuesday were those associated with Richard Spencer, the head of alt-right think tank National Policy Institute, @PaulTown, @PaxDickinson, @DatRickyVaughn and @JohnRiversToo, according to USA Today.\nRead more: Twitter Suspends Multiple Alt-Right Accounts",

About 730,000 birds have been killed to prevent the spread of the disease as of Friday, according to the ministry - under 1 percent of the country's poultry population of 84.7 million.\nA new case was confirmed at a duck farm in the southwestern part of the country, where 16,700 ducks had been culled as a precautionary measure, according to the statement.\nKim Yong-sang, a senior official at the ministry's animal health management division, said six cases were confirmed as of Friday with four other suspected cases still being tested.\nMore on this...

      "text": "Published November 25, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print NEW ORLEANS (AP) Saints coach Sean Payton and Los Angeles Rams defensive coordinator Gregg Williams sound a touch sentimental when their time together in New Orleans comes up.\nPerhaps they don't see the point of revisiting the disenchantment, anger and betrayal surrounding a sequence of events which included Williams' firing from the Saints; his subsequent cooperation in the NFL's bounty probe; and both coaches' season-long suspensions in 2012.\nMaybe this isn't the best week to air old resentments, given Payton and Williams will coach in the same game for the first time since they were on the same staff. The Saints host the Rams in a crucial game for both clubs Sunday.\nMore from FoxSports Dez Bryant rips Josh Norman after Cowboys' win over Washington Dez Byrant and Josh Norman fight after final whistle on Thanksgiving Ezekiel Elliott, Dak Prescott win Galloping Gobbler after Thanksgiving win vs. Washington Jimmy Johnson reacts to Dallas Cowboys Week 12 Thanksgiving win over Washington Redskins Or maybe, nearly a half-decade later, they really have moved on.\n''No. 1, I think he's a real good defensive coordinator,'' Payton said of Williams. ''He's done a great job and is doing a great job in L.A. right now. When you win Super Bowls, those are important things and obviously he was a big part of that with our program and our team.''\nWhen Williams was asked Friday about his return to New Orleans, he said he's ''really looking forward to it,'' adding that he's ''got a lot of great memories, a lot of good feelings, a lot of good people there that I still stay in contact with.''\nHis reception by fans in the Superdome could very well be mixed. Some will appreciate his contributions during the best three-year run in Saints history, when the team won 37 regular season games and four playoff games, including the 2009 NFL championship. Others might never forgive him for his role in the bounty probe, since which the Saints have made the playoffs only once and won only one playoff game.\n''It's not about that, it's about these guys playing,'' Williams asserted. ''It's not about me.''\nAnd yet, there's no avoiding his imprint on both defenses.\nRams offensive coordinator Rob Boras referred to Saints defensive coordinator Dennis Allen as a ''Gregg Williams disciple.''\n''There's a lot of similarities there,'' Boras said. ''We know they're aggressive.''\nAllen was New Orleans' secondary coach during Williams' first two seasons with the Saints. While Allen didn't exactly embrace the term, ''disciple,'' he did not hesitate to acknowledge Williams' influence on his own approach to directing a defense.\n''There's certainly a lot of elements to the things that I learned when I was working here under Gregg. A lot of the things that we do defensively both from a philosophical standpoint and from a schematic standpoint are similar,'' Allen said. ''Those were obviously good times for us as far as playing defensive football here. ... So I don't know what word I would use to describe that, but I'd certainly say that there's a lot of things that I learned during that time.''\nAllen said he remains in touch with Williams ''every now and then.''\n''I've still got a lot of respect for Gregg as a defensive coach,''. ... We pay close attention to their tape and what they do schematically and things that they do well that we can maybe incorporate into what we're doing, you know, we try to incorporate some of those things. I just think there's a certain style to playing defense and I think it's fun to watch.''\nBoth Williams and Allen preach more of an aggressive than reactionary style. They blitz and don't shy away from taking risks with one-on-one coverage. They urge their players to play fast, attacking, hard-hitting defense with the goal of instilling some measure of fear in opposing skill players.\nBrees said he is sure it would mean a lot to Williams to have his defense play a role in beating the Saints.\n''I know his attitude, I know his demeanor and his approach,'' Brees said. ''He is going to have those guys ready to play - and we'll be ready to play, too.''\nWilliams said he is eager to test his scheme against Brees in a game for the first time since 2006, when Williams' Redskins beat Brees' Saints 16-10 in New Orleans.\nBrees ''presents challenges because of his understanding of the game,'' Williams said, adding it was ''always fun to compete in practices with him and now in a game.''\nAnd Brees made it clear the respect is mutual - at least as far as X's and O's are concerned.\n''I choose to focus on the positives and not the negatives,'' Brees said. ''Obviously, (the bounty probe) was a tough situation. The positive is Gregg Williams was our defensive coordinator from 2009, `10 and `11. We won a lot of football games together and he did a great job here with our defense, and we share a Super Bowl together from that 2009 season. I choose to look at that and I appreciate that.\n''As far as what's happened since then, coaches go to different places,'' Brees said. ''He is a very talented defensive football coach and I know his defense has played extremely well this season, especially the last four weeks. I know that we will need our best to beat them.''\n---\nFor more NFL coverage: http://www.pro32.ap.org and http://www.twitter.com/AP-NFL\n---\nAP Sports Writer Greg Beacham in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

      "text": "\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter initially on Saturday to react in only four words to Fidel Castro’s death before issuing a longer statement condemning the “brutal dictator” and yearning for a free Cuba. \n“Fidel Castro is dead!” Trump tweeted on the news of the 90-year-old’s death. Fidel Castro is dead! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016 \nThe longtime revolutionary leader died Friday, presenting potential opportunities for change in a country whose relations with the United States have recently begun to improve. \nCastro’s death came just weeks after Trump, a frequent critic of the reopening of diplomatic ties with Cuba, was elected president. \n“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,” Trump said in a statement issued a couple of hours after his tweet. \n“Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.” \nThe President-elect added, “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban-Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.” \nVice President-elect Mike Pence tweeted of the dawning of new hope now that “the tyrant” has died. \n“The tyrant #Castro is dead. New hope dawns. We will stand with the oppressed Cuban people for a free and democratic Cuba. Viva Cuba Libre!” Pence said. \nTrump had threatened to undo efforts by President Barack Obama to bring the US and Cuba closer together, slamming the recent agreement between the two countries for better relations. \nIn October, Trump criticized the Obama administration’s effort to normalize relations with Cuba as a “very weak agreement,” although he said some sort of a deal is “fine.” \nTrump told Miami CBS journalist Jim DeFede that he would do “whatever you have to do to get a strong agreement,” even if that meant breaking off the recently resumed diplomatic contacts. \nIn March, the billionaire businessman had expressed interest in opening a hotel in Cuba, telling CNN it was “OK to bring Cuba back into the fold.” \nThe real estate developer also had promised during the campaign “to find out” if a Newsweek report that his associates may have violated the US-Cuban embargo in 1998 by going to Cuba to explore business opportunities was true. A Bloomberg story said additional Trump associates went to Cuba in 2012 and 2013 to entertain opening a golf resort. \n“I don’t know exactly where they were. I can tell you that Cuba wants to, you know, really negotiate with us. They’ve said, ‘We want to negotiate.’ They want to make some kind of a deal. I’ve said, I don’t want to make any deals unless we know we have a deal with Cuba,” he told DeFede. \n“But you think they did, in fact, go to Cuba?” DeFede asked. \n“Well, know that Cuba wants us to go there. I’m not interested in going,” Trump replied. \nDeFede countered, “No, I meant as emissaries — did those individuals travel there to have those discussions?” \n“I would have to find out,” Trump said. “I know they had some meetings, but I would have to find out.” Related stories ",

      "text": "Chelsea fans on Twitter want one Manchester United player in exchange for Willian Published 24/7 \nWillian was the one shining light for Chelsea in an otherwise dismal campaign last season. \nThe Brazilian scored five goals and registered 10 assists in the Premier League for the Blues. He also bagged six more goals in the cup competitions, including five in Europe. \nFew would have predicted that Willian would find himself out of favour under Antonio Conte, the revered Italian coach who replaced Guus Hiddink in the summer. Article continues below \nThe 28-year-old missed Chelsea’s 3-0 win over Leicester City in mid-October following the death of his mother and has played just 26 minutes in the four Premier League fixtures since then. \nIn both the 5-0 win over Everton and the 1-0 win over Middlesbrough, Willian failed to even make the subs’ bench. Article continues below Liverpool fans furious with one player after first half vs Sunderland [Tweets] Willian faces a battle to win his place back \nOf course, it’s possible that Conte has given the South American some additional time to come to terms with the mother’s passing. \nHowever, an increasing number of Chelsea fans are starting to believe Conte simply doesn’t fancy Willian. \nAnd with Victor Moses currently playing so well on the right flank, the former Shakhtar Donetsk star faces a battle to win back his place in the Blues’ starting line-up. Chelsea fans on Twitter would swap Willian... for Martial \nReports this week have linked Willian with a shock move to Manchester United where, of course, Jose Mourinho is the manager. \nWillian flourished under Mourinho at Stamford Bridge and a reunion might suit both parties. \nSome Chelsea fans, rather surprisingly, would be up for the club selling Willian - but only if it means obtaining the services of Anthony Martial in return. \nMourinho has warned Mourinho that he’s running out of chances to impress at Old Trafford and a significant number of Chelsea fans would take the France international in return for Willian. \nCheck out these tweets… Surely no United fan thinks this is a good deal? \nDespite his recent struggles, few United fans would be content if such a deal took place. \nMartial showcased his immense talent and potential last season, scoring 17 goals in 49 appearances in his debut campaign in England, and still hasn’t turned 21 yet. \nWould any Man Utd fan take Willian in exchange for Anthony Martial?

      "text": "\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter initially on Saturday to react in only four words to Fidel Castro’s death before issuing a longer statement condemning the “brutal dictator” and yearning for a free Cuba. \n“Fidel Castro is dead!” Trump tweeted on the news of the 90-year-old’s death. Fidel Castro is dead! \n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 26, 2016 \nThe longtime revolutionary leader died Friday, presenting potential opportunities for change in a country whose relations with the United States have recently begun to improve. \nCastro’s death came just weeks after Trump, a frequent critic of the reopening of diplomatic ties with Cuba, was elected president. \n“Today, the world marks the passing of a brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades,” Trump said in a statement issued a couple of hours after his tweet. \n**More coverage on the death of Fidel Castro, here** \n“Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights. While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.” \nThe President-elect added, “Though the tragedies, deaths and pain caused by Fidel Castro cannot be erased, our administration will do all it can to ensure the Cuban people can finally begin their journey toward prosperity and liberty. I join the many Cuban-Americans who supported me so greatly in the presidential campaign, including the Brigade 2506 Veterans Association that endorsed me, with the hope of one day soon seeing a free Cuba.” \nVice President-elect Mike Pence tweeted of the dawning of new hope now that “the tyrant” has died. \n“The tyrant #Castro is dead. New hope dawns. We will stand with the oppressed Cuban people for a free and democratic Cuba. Viva Cuba Libre!” Pence said. \nTrump had threatened to undo efforts by President Barack Obama to bring the US and Cuba closer together, slamming the recent agreement between the two countries for better relations. \nIn October, Trump criticized the Obama administration’s effort to normalize relations with Cuba as a “very weak agreement,” although he said some sort of a deal is “fine.” \nTrump told Miami CBS journalist Jim DeFede that he would do “whatever you have to do to get a strong agreement,” even if that meant breaking off the recently resumed diplomatic contacts. \nIn March, the billionaire businessman had expressed interest in opening a hotel in Cuba, telling CNN it was “OK to bring Cuba back into the fold.” \nThe real estate developer also had promised during the campaign “to find out” if a Newsweek report that his associates may have violated the US-Cuban embargo in 1998 by going to Cuba to explore business opportunities was true. A Bloomberg story said additional Trump associates went to Cuba in 2012 and 2013 to entertain opening a golf resort. \n“I don’t know exactly where they were. I can tell you that Cuba wants to, you know, really negotiate with us. They’ve said, ‘We want to negotiate.’ They want to make some kind of a deal. I’ve said, I don’t want to make any deals unless we know we have a deal with Cuba,” he told DeFede. \n“But you think they did, in fact, go to Cuba?” DeFede asked. \n“Well, know that Cuba wants us to go there. I’m not interested in going,” Trump replied. \nDeFede countered, “No, I meant as emissaries — did those individuals travel there to have those discussions?” \n“I would have to find out,” Trump said. “I know they had some meetings, but I would have to find out.” 38.907192 -77.036871 ",

      "text": "By Andrew O'Reilly \nPublished November 26, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print When Fidel Castro and his rebel army marched into Havana in the early days of January 1959 Dwight D. Eisenhower was president of the United States. At the time of the Cuban strongman’s death on Friday, Donald Trump is preparing his move into the White House.\nThe 57 years in between Castro seizing power in Cuba and his death were filled with turbulent moments between Havana and Washington – from the Cuban Missile Crisis and the Bay of Pigs to the Mariel boatlift and Elian Gonzalez – but his passing will do little to change the current thaw in relations between the two Cold War-era foes that has sped up in the last few years, experts say.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Fidel Castro, left, raises his brother's hand, Cuba's President Raul Castro, center, as they sing the anthem of international socialism in Havana, Cuba. (AP) \n“With [Fidel Castro] gone there is less resistance to opening up to Cuba,” Jason Marczak, director of the Latin America Economic Growth Initiative at the Atlantic Council's Adrienne Arsht Latin America Center, told FoxNews.com. “It’s a real blessing in disguise for those in Cuba and the U.S. who want to see the opening in relations between the two countries continue.”\nWhile Castro still remains a potent symbol of anti-imperialism and a figurehead for the Latin American left, his ironclad grip on Cuban affairs had in the last few years dissipated tremendously since he formally handed over power to his younger brother, Raul, in 2008 amid failing health.\nAs his health continued to decline over the last decade, Castro had less and less say in the ruling of the country as Raul Castro began to steer the once hardline communist nation toward more free market economic policies and eased the long-standing tension between Cuba and the U.S.\nIt is well known that the elder Castro disliked a number of his brother’s polices and moves – especially President Obama’s visit to the island earlier this year – and some experts believe - now that his brother is dead - Raul Castro will push for even more changes both internally and with the U.S.\n“Castro inhibited Raul from making many reforms and moving forward,” Elizabeth Newhouse, the director of the Center for International Policy’s Cuba Project, told FoxNews.com. “His passing may embolden Raul to move a little faster. Maybe he’ll take advantage of this and speed up changes before he himself retires in 2018.”\nJUDY MILLER: EVEN WITH CASTRO GONE, CUBA'S FUTURE IS IN DOUBT \nThe death of Fidel Castro certainly marks a sea change in terms U.S.-Cuban relations, but analysts say the bigger question is less what Cuba will do now and more about what will become of the thaw when President-elect Trump takes office in January.\nOn the campaign trail, Trump flip-flopped on his stance toward U.S.-Cuban relations – at times speaking out against the decades-long embargo imposed on the island and at other times preaching that it must be upheld – and his response to Castro’s death was both damning and hopeful.\n“Fidel Castro’s legacy is one of firing squads, theft, unimaginable suffering, poverty and the denial of fundamental human rights,” Trump said in a statement on Saturday. \"While Cuba remains a totalitarian island, it is my hope that today marks a move away from the horrors endured for too long, and toward a future in which the wonderful Cuban people finally live in the freedom they so richly deserve.”\nGiven that Castro was such a polarizing figure within the Cuban-American community, his death could take away much of the drive for a harsher rhetoric from Washington toward Havana.\nRelated Image Expand / Contract Boys play near a graffiti of Fidel Castro and Hugo Chavez in Caracas, Venezuela (AP) \n“Fidel Castro was a symbol of the people’s animus,” Christopher Sabatini, a professor at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, told FoxNews.com. “A lot of the momentum to roll back these changes will slow down. It takes a lot of wind out the sails.”\nSabatini added that even if Trump tried to roll back the progress made by the Obama administration, he would face a severe backlash from a number of businesses that stand to benefit from the renewed relations between the country, including major airlines and the travel and tourism industry.\n“Trump has not said that he is opposed to the thaw in relations,” Sabatini said. “He’s a businessman and he has said that the just wants a better deal.”\nCastro’s death may have been celebrated on the streets of Miami and other Cuban-American enclaves across the country, but the late Latin American strongman in being mourned in other parts of the region.\nFor members of Latin America’s revolutionary leftwing, the death of Castro leaves a void that he had almost singlehandedly filled for over five decades. As leftist leaders in places like Venezuela, Bolivia and Ecuador battle struggling economies, civil unrest and regional shift toward conservatism, they have no one to look to anymore for guidance.\n“That iconic revolutionary figure is gone,” Sabatini said. “While the appeal of this type of leader may not be gone, there is no one to inherit Castro’s mantle.”",

      "text": "Published November 26, 2016 Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print MIAMI GARDENS, Fla. (AP) Brad Kaaya became Miami's all-time career passing leader, throwing for 396 yards and a career-high-tying four touchdowns as the Hurricanes beat Duke 40-21 on Saturday.\nKaaya completed 22 of 35 passes and now has 9,686 yards in three seasons - 121 more than Ken Dorsey, who piled up 9,565 from 1999 through 2002. Kaaya broke the mark with a 42-yard pass to Stacy Coley in the third quarter.\nDavid Njoku had touchdown catches of 76 and 58 yards, and Coley made nine catches for 118 yards and a touchdown for Miami (8-4, 5-3 Atlantic Coast Conference).\nMore from FoxSports (7) Penn State Nittany Lions crush Michigan State Spartans at Beaver Stadium (6) Wisconsin Badgers capture Paul Bunyan's Axe with win over Minnesota (1) Alabama Crimson Tide defeat (13) Auburn Tigers in 2016 Iron Bowl (18) West Virginia Mountaineers defeat Iowa State Cyclones in 30-point win Mark Walton also caught a TD pass for the Hurricanes, who have won four straight.\nDaniel Jones completed 34 of 50 passes for 316 yards for Duke (4-8, 1-7), which will miss a bowl game for the first time in five seasons.\nThe teams combined for five scores in the game's first five possessions, and Miami's lead was only 16-14 at the half. But Kaaya struck twice in the third quarter, hitting Njoku for the long score and then connecting with Coley to make it 33-14 not long after the record-breaking completion.\nAnd now the question becomes if this was Kaaya's home finale.\nGoing pro will be a serious option, and with good reason. This was the 11th 300-yard game of Kaaya's college career, the fourth four-TD game he's had as a Hurricane and he's now the only quarterback in Miami history with three seasons of at least 3,000 yards.\nHe's also now within seven completions of matching Jacory Harris' school record of 703.\nTHE TAKEAWAY\nDuke: Jones completed his first 10 passes, getting 119 yards and two touchdowns out of them. But the Blue Devils, after getting 14 points out their first two possessions, then sputtered to a halt. ... T.J. Rahming caught 10 passes for 117 yards and a touchdown for Duke.\nMiami: This was the first time this season Miami had two 100-yard receivers. ... Miami hadn't finished a regular season with four or more consecutive wins since 2002, when it was 12-0 going into the Fiesta Bowl. The Hurricanes will try to win a bowl game for the first time since 2006.\nSENIOR DAY\nMiami honored its 14 departing seniors in a pregame ceremony, as well as four underclassmen - one being reserve offensive lineman Hunter Knighton, who recovered from heatstroke and returned to the field last season. Knighton will try to play elsewhere in 2017.\nKAAYA WATCH\nIf he comes out, Kaaya could be the first Miami quarterback to get taken in the first round in 30 years. Miami has had only two QBs go that early in a draft - Jim Kelly (No. 14 overall) in 1983, and Vinny Testaverde (No. 1 overall) in 1987. Kelly was a college teammate of Hurricanes coach Mark Richt, and Testaverde's son Vincent is a current Miami backup.\nUP NEXT\nDuke: Season complete.\nMiami: Awaiting bowl invitation on Dec. 4, possibly to the TaxSlayer or Pinstripe.",

      "text": "Aspiring writer, women’s rights advocate, former Twitter user 17 mins ago If this doesn’t prove that the Alt-right is racist, I dunno what will It didn’t take long for the Alt-right to prove its racist roots. The first speech at their first conference was met with Nazi salutes and “Hail Trump” cheers. What else do you need? The conference, held in Washington D.C., brought together Alt-right-ers from all over the country to hear various speakers, such as Richard Spencer, who spoke before them and uttered “Hail Hitler” while boasting about white pride and white supremacy (he literally said that whites were superior ). This is the man who claims to have invented the term “Alt-right” as a “movement about white identity.” Video of Spencer’s speech has made the rounds at the news in the last few days (thanks to The Atlantic ). If you haven’t seen it by now, here it is, in all its racist, Nazi-saluting, Alt-right glory: “America was a white country, designed for ourselves and our posterity. It is our creation, it is our inheritance, and it belongs to us.”  — Richard Spencer. Disgusting.",

      "text": "TORONTO - Social media users were quick to mock Prime Minister Justin Trudeau for his statement Saturday expressing \"deep sorrow\" about the death of former Cuban president Fidel Castro.\nTrudeau acknowledged the late president was a \"controversial figure,\" but remembered him as \"a legendary revolutionary and orator\" who \"made significant improvements to the education and health care of his island nation.\"\nPeople from around the world took to Twitter under the hashtag \"#TrudeauEulogies\" with similar eulogies, in the style of Trudeau's, for various villains, both historical and fictional.\n@MW_Johnson1 tweeted: \"While a controversial figure, John Wilkes Booth will be remembered as a lover of the theatre.\"\nAnd from Mumbai, India, @AjitGJoshi tweeted: \"Voldermort ruled the wizard world and guided the death eaters to their Nirvana. He had a way with children and elves.\"\nOthers tweeted eulogies for Josef Stalin, Adolph Hitler, Jack the Ripper, King Kong, and Dracula as #TrudeauEulogies trended high in Canada on Saturday evening.\nTrudeau's statement on the death of Castro also drew criticism in a more serious form on Saturday, including from Conservative leadership hopeful Lisa Raitt who said that Trudeau should be ashamed of himself.\n ",

      "text": "Profile characteristics of fake Twitter accounts Supraja Gurajala , Joshua S White , Brian Hudson , Brian R Voter , Jeanna N Matthews DOI: 10.1177/2053951716674236, Oct 2016 PDF Abstract In online social networks, the audience size commanded by an organization or an individual is a critical measure of that entity’s popularity and this measure has important economic and/or political implications. Such efforts to measure popularity of users or exploit knowledge about their audience are complicated by the presence of fake profiles on these networks. In this study, analysis of 62 million publicly available Twitter user profiles was conducted and a strategy to identify automatically generated fake profiles was established. Using a combination of a pattern-matching algorithm on screen-names and an analysis of update times, a reasonable number (∼0.1% of total users) of highly reliable fake user accounts were identified. Analysis of profile creation times and URLs of these fake accounts revealed their distinct behavior relative to a ground truth data set. The characteristics of friends and followers of users in the two data sets further revealed the very different nature of the two groups. The ratio of number of followers-to-friends for ground truth users was ∼1, consistent with past observations, while the fake profiles had a median ratio ∼30, indicating that the fake users we identified were primarily focused on gathering friends. An analysis of the temporal evolution of accounts over 2 years showed that the friends-to-followers ratio increased over time for fake profiles while they decreased for ground truth users. Our results, thus, suggest that a profile-based approach can be used for identifying a core set of fake online social network users in a time-efficient manner. Twitter Introduction 1 Online social networks (OSNs) have become the preferred means of communication among a diverse set of users, including: individuals, companies, and families divided over several continents. Some of the most popular OSNs include: Facebook, Twitter, GooglePlus, Instagram, LinkedIn, Weibo, and RenRen. Of the different OSNs, Twitter has become popular with users such as young adults, governments, commercial enterprises, and politicians as a way of instantaneously connecting with their audience and directly conveying their message ( Parmelee and Bichard, 2011 ). Tweets-based information and communication have begun to play an important role in diverse areas such as political uprisings ( Syeed et al., 2014 ), digital epidemiology ( Salathé et al., 2013 ), and scientific communication ( Bennett, 2014 ). These diverse advances are facilitated by the large size of the platform’s audience and the ability to effectively and directly reach their targeted audience. Another advantage for users on OSN platforms is the ability to understand the characteristics of their audience, such as age, location, etc., thus, allowing users to tailor their products or messages as needed ( Mainwaring, 2011 ). The continued success of Twitter (and other OSNs) as a platform for large-scale communication and the expansion of efforts to mine their data for new and novel applications related to public health, economic development, scientific dissemination, etc. necessitates confidence in the authenticity of OSN users. The presence of fake profiles (or Sybils/Socialbots) generated by cyber-opportunists (or cyber-criminals) that are nearly indistinguishable from real profiles complicates authentication of user accounts ( Douceur, 2002 ). Some fake accounts are created to mimic a specific person’s account while others are created simply as a general account to serve as a fake follower. Sybils are automatic/semi-automatic profiles created to mimic human profiles. Fake profiles (or their operators) send requests to “follow” or “friend” OSN users and these requests are often accepted (80% probability when there are several common “friends”) by unsuspecting users (Yang et al., 2014). Sometimes, a fake profile is created to essentially duplicate a user’s online presence. Such attacks, called identity clone attacks, are devised to collect personal information and direct online fraud. Upon gaining acceptance of a few legitimate users, they then begin to gather “friends” or “followers” because of their ability to accurately fake the accounts of legitimate users. Even when there is no attempt to impersonate a real person, fake accounts can still cause problems. Many are created to serve as “followers for hire” and are used for inflating follower numbers for other accounts. The presence of fake followers can: affect the popularity rating of individuals or organizations measured based on follower number count ( Kwak et al., 2010 ); alter the characteristics of the audience ( Stringhini et al., 2013 ); or create a legitimacy problem for individuals/organizations ( Parmelee and Bichard, 2011 ). As a result of these problems, OSNs such as Twitter are interested in mechanisms for identifying and eliminating fake accounts on a near real-time basis. In this work, we present a detection technique that was developed to identify automatically generated Twitter accounts based on analysis of publicly available Twitter user profile information. The profile-based detection allows for fast analysis of the large Twitter user database and allows for identifying possible fake accounts even before they accumulate a “Tweet” history. The characteristics of the fake profile set are then compared and contrasted against a ground truth data set. This paper is organized into the following sections: Related work on spam detection in Twitter; Acquisition of Twitter data; Design and Methodology; Analysis of Results; and Conclusions. Related work There have been several detection strategies developed to tackle the problem of Spam in social networks. These techniques have largely relied on using a graph theory approach to characterize social graph properties of Sybil accounts ( Danezis and Mittal, 2009 ). In response, “spammers” have worked to integrate Sybils into authentic user communities by creating accounts with full profiles and background information similar to authentic users ( Yang et al., 2011 ). Such techniques have complicated detection efforts, requiring continued development of new spam-recognition approaches. Machine learning techniques and honeypot harvesting approaches have been used to classify Twitter accounts as legitimate or not. Honeypot techniques help identify spammers by attracting them to their sites and embedding themselves into their networks with the goal of harvesting information from them ( Lee et al., 2010 ). Machine learning techniques use spammer profile information, obtained via approaches such as honeypot harvesting, to train themselves to understand spammer behavior and thus aiding in the development of detection techniques ( Stringhini et al., 2010 ). Other Twitter-specific approaches to identify spammers and fake profiles include: detection based on tweet-content (e.g. “number of hashtags per word of each tweet” ( Benevenuto et al., 2010 ); use of tweet/tweeter characteristics such as “reputation score”, “number of duplicate Tweets”, and “number of URLs” ( Wang, 2010 ); and comparison of tweet links (URLs) to publicly blacklisted URLs/domains (Grier et al., 2010). As the creation and maintenance of fake accounts is generally done automatically, profile-pattern detection provides a fast way of detecting spam without detailed “Tweet” analysis ( Thomas et al., 2013 ). For example, Benevenuto et al. (2010) used profile information such as “number of followers and number of followings” to identify fake profiles. Thomas et al. (2013) used a multi-variable pattern-recognition approach based on user-profile-name, screen-name, and email parameters. They used fake accounts purchased from an underground market and determined that there was strong and consistent correlation between the three parameters for all fake accounts. Such a pattern recognition approach could potentially be used as a pre-identifier of fake accounts prior to a more detailed authentication effort. Most recent approaches to detect fake accounts in Twitter and other OSNs have focused on detection of clustered fake accounts based on their activity patterns. For example, Jiang et al. (2014, 2016) used a method, called CatchSync, to detect suspicious behavior in Twitter based on synchronized and abnormal user activity. They were able to show that their parameter-free approach resulted in high detection efficiency of fake accounts in Twitter. Similarly, Clark et al. (2016) used a classification scheme based on natural language trained on organic users to then identify messages from automated accounts and detect fake accounts. Such activity-based techniques can identify fake accounts after they establish their tweet-history. A different approach to identify fake accounts is based on analysis of a combination of features including tweets and user profiles for early and efficient identification of fake profiles (Xiao et al., 2015). For example, El Azab et al. (2015) showed that fake accounts on Twitter could be identified with high efficiency based on an established minimum set of factors, including number of followers, availability of geo-information, used a hashtag in a tweet, etc. Xiao et al. (2015) used a supervised machine-learning pipeline to compare text frequencies in features such as name, email address, etc. to classify LinkedIn accounts as either malicious or legitimate. In this study, we further examine the possibility of identifying fake accounts merely based on profile information to enable early classification of clustered fake accounts in Twitter. We use a user profile-pattern detection based approach with the inclusion of user activity time stamp information, to develop a new process for detection of fake profiles with high reliability. The details of our schema and the analysis of the fake profile set enabled with this approach are presented below. Design and implementation For analysis of user profiles, the first step was to obtain publicly available Twitter user profile information. Utilizing social web-crawling, we gathered profiles of ∼62 million users and used map-reducing techniques and pattern recognition approaches to detect fake profiles. The details of the Twitter user profile acquisition approach and analysis techniques are discussed below. Acquisition of Twitter user profiles Twitter provides access to user and social graph data through the Twitter REST API v1.1.2. (Twitter Inc., n.d.). For non-protected users, the majority of the users’ profile information is publicly available and accessible through this API. In order for Twitter to maintain the reliability of its services and control costs, they employ rate-limiting steps, restricting the number of calls that can be made to the API per rate limit window, currently defined as a 15-minute interval. Version 1.1 of the API rate limits an application based on the number of users that have authorized the application, and therefore granted it an access token. Crawling the social graph As recently as 2010, it was feasible to crawl over the entire Twitter user ID space. This was at a time when the maximum user ID was estimated to be less than 800 million ( Gabielkov and Legout, 2012 ). With the maximum Twitter user ID significantly larger than 1 billion now, an exhaustive search over the Twitter user ID space has become challenging. Furthermore, the sparsity of the Twitter user ID space also complicates the search process. It has been estimated that spam account creation accounts for as high as 93% of all new accounts, 68% of which are detected and automatically suspended or deleted by Twitter ( Dawson, 2013 ). This would mean that in an exhaustive search, approximately 68% of user IDs (roughly 1.4B) for whom we would request information are accounts that no longer exist or are unavailable due to suspension. This would waste both our and Twitter’s resources. With user IDs now exceeding 2 billion, the sparsity of the user ID space, and the rate limits imposed by Twitter with the rollout of the Twitter REST API v1.1, an exhaustive search over the entire user ID space is no longer feasible. To overcome these issues, our approach performs a breadth first search (BFS) over a given set of seed users. As the social graph is crawled, previously unknown Twitter user IDs obtained from the list of the user’s followers are pursued and eventually the user profiles for these IDs are acquired. This ensures that all user profile requests we make to Twitter include only valid Twitter user IDs. Effectively, this adds each previously unknown follower of a user as a seed user for the next iteration of the search. We used a multi-account approach with application access to crawl the Twitter social graph and gathered ∼62 million Twitter user profiles, within a three-month period in late 2013. Methodology Our crawler obtained 33 different attributes for each Twitter profile, and these attributes are listed in the online supplementary material. Our schema then analyzed patterns among combinations of these attributes to identify a highly reliable core set of fake profiles, which provided the basis for identifying key distinguishing characteristics of fake accounts based on their publicly available profile information. To limit the parameter space of our analysis, we initially investigated the database semi-manually to determine the primary attributes that differed among most users. From this analysis, it was established that several of the 33 attributes were largely unused (or left as default) by most users. The key attributes that were either user-selected or varied with account-usage were: id , followers_count , friends_count , verified , created_at , description , location , updated , profile_image_url , and screen_name . Using this reduced attribute set, we used the analysis approach described below for identification of a reliable fake profile set. A schematic diagram outlining our algorithm for detection of the core fake group is shown in Figure 1 . Starting with our 62 million user-profile database, we obtained groups (containing at least two accounts) with the same user profile information of name, description, and location. This filtering process resulted in generating 724,494 groups containing a total of 6,958,523 accounts. To further refine the 724,494 groups, their screen names were analyzed and near-identical ones were identified using a pattern-recognition algorithm procedure described below. ",

(AP Photo/Rebecca Blackwell, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) –   Fidel Castro's passing removes what was long the single greatest psychological barrier to a warmer U.S.-Cuba relationship. But it also adds to the uncertainty ahead with the transition from an Obama to a Trump administration.\n\"A brutal dictator\" of a \"totalitarian island,\" declared President-elect Donald Trump, underscoring the historical trauma still separating the countries.\nA more restrained President Barack Obama, carefully promoting and working to preserve his own attempt to rebuild those ties, said history would assess Castro's impact and that the Cuban people could reflect \"with powerful emotions\" about how their longtime leader influenced their country.\nIn death as in life, Castro has divided opinion: a revolutionary who stood up to American aggression or a ruthless dictator whose movement trampled human rights and democratic aspirations.\nPresident Raul Castro, Fidel's younger brother, is 85. Their Communist Party shows no signs of opening up greater political space despite agreeing with the United States to re-establish embassies and facilitate greater trade and investment.\nMore On This...

      "text": "increase font size Trump sounds off on Twitter about Clinton joining in recount His senior adviser also criticizes the move after the president-elect backed off his promise to prosecute the former secretary of state. The Washington Post Read Article \nPresident-elect Donald Trump unleashed a tweetstorm Sunday about plans by Hillary Clinton’s campaign to join in the election recount in Wisconsin initiated by Green Party candidate Jill Stein. \nHis sentiments were soon echoed by Kellyanne Conway, his senior adviser and former campaign manager, who went so far as to criticize the Clinton campaign for making the decision after Trump had been “magnanimous” in backing off his promise to prosecute the former secretary of state – even though the two issues are unrelated. \nTrump had already begun sounding off against the recount efforts late Saturday, when he called them a “scam” by the Green Party to “fill up their coffers.” He also criticized the Democrats for joining the effort. \nTrump resumed his criticism Sunday, saying that Clinton had conceded the election in her phone call to him before his victory speech Nov. 9 and that nothing would change. \nTrump then spent five tweets quoting parts of Clinton’s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would “keep you in suspense” rather than outright promise to accept the election results. \nAt the debate, Clinton had called Trump’s answer “horrifying” and “a direct threat to our democracy.” \nTrump’s tweets: \n“Hillary’s debate answer on delay: ‘That is horrifying. That is not the way our democracy works. Been around for 240 years. We’ve had free \n“and fair elections. We’ve accepted the outcomes when we may not have liked them, and that is what must be expected of anyone standing on a \n“during a general election. I, for one, am appalled that somebody that is the nominee of one of our two major parties would take that kind \n“of position.” Then, separately she stated, “He said something truly horrifying … he refused to say that he would respect the results of \n“this election. That is a direct threat to our democracy.’ She then said, ‘We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald” \nFor the record, Trump’s tweets capture the essence of Clinton’s debate responses but do not quote the full exchange faithfully. \nTrump capped it all off by quoting Clinton’s concession speech and then his signature adjective: “So much time and money will be spent – same result! Sad” \nOn the Sunday political-show circuit, Conway also derided plans by Clinton’s campaign to participate in an election recount effort. \nOn “State of the Union,” Conway said Trump was not focused on prosecuting Clinton but wouldn’t rule it out – which she said indicated that Trump was being “incredibly gracious and magnanimous” to Clinton. \nThough the two issues are neither related nor causal, Conway tried to link Trump’s latest public comments about not pursuing a prosecution of Clinton to the Clinton campaign’s decision to join the recount effort. \n“But this is how the president-elect feels at this moment about Hillary Clinton,” Conway said. “I would say, in response that, I guess her attitude toward that is to have her counsel, Mark Elias, go and join this ridiculously fantastical recount that Jill Stein is engaging in Wisconsin and perhaps elsewhere. So you’ve got the President-elect Donald Trump being quite magnanimous to Hillary Clinton and you’ve got her responding with joining into this recount.” \nConway said that she was confident the recount would not change the election results in Wisconsin, where Stein received 33,000 votes.

      "text": "November 28, 2016 1:03 AM Trump:Millions cast votes illegally Blasts Clinton on Twitter over joining recount effort Paul Kane | Washington Post \nPresident-elect Donald Trump spent Sunday ridiculing Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign for joining a recount effort in Wisconsin, ending his day on Twitter by parroting a widely debunked conspiracy theory that her campaign benefited from massive voter fraud. \nAs his senior advisers engaged in an escalating feud over who the next secretary of state should be, Trump focused publicly on Clinton’s tally of 64 million votes – more than 2 million more than he garnered – by suggesting without evidence that millions of people illegally voted in the election. \n“In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally,” Trump tweeted late Sunday, one of more than 10 tweets on the recount issue. \nThat accusation – spread by conspiracy sites such as Infowars.com and discredited by fact-checking organizations – gained traction among some far-right conservatives disappointed that Trump lost the popular vote. \nBut Trump’s embrace of the claim created even more instability around the election results from both ends of the political spectrum, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein leading calls among liberal activists for recounts in key battleground states to make sure vote fraud did not give the election to Trump. \nThe charges and countercharges could present a highly toxic issue for the Justice Department, including Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., Trump’s nominee to be attorney general, whose tenure, if confirmed, comes amid a long-running battle over renewal of the Voting Rights Act. The two parties are already locked in fights over ballot access, with Republicans advocating ID requirements and other limitations that Democrats say are aimed at suppressing the votes of minorities and others more likely to vote Democratic. \nTrump spent the Thanksgiving weekend out of the public spotlight, holed up inside his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and continuing his private deliberations about building the next administration. Kellyanne Conway, his former campaign manager and now senior adviser to the transition team, said on NBC’s “Meet the Press” that Trump and President Barack Obama spoke by phone for about 45 minutes on Saturday, the latest in a series of conversations the two men have had since the bitter campaign concluded. \nConway also led a remarkable rear-guard attack on 2012 GOP nominee Mitt Romney as a possible secretary of state, arguing that the former Massachusetts governor was disloyal to Trump and should not be considered for the post. \nHer remarks highlighted a fierce behind-the-scenes battle within the Trump camp over whether Romney should be offered the job as a healing gesture with the establishment or instead whether a loyalist such as former New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani should get the nod. \nRather than referee that dispute, however, Trump’s only public proclamations came over Twitter – his favorite means of communication – beginning at 7:19 a.m. Sunday, when he lambasted the Clinton campaign for agreeing to take part in a recount of votes in Wisconsin spearheaded by Stein. \n“Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in. Nothing will change,” Trump tweeted. \nTrump then spent five tweets quoting parts of Clinton’s responses at the third presidential debate, during which she blasted Trump for telling moderator Chris Wallace that he would “keep you in suspense” rather than outright promise to accept the election results. \nAt the debate, Clinton had called Trump’s answer “horrifying” and “a direct threat to our democracy.” \nOn Saturday, Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias said Clinton’s advisers had been monitoring voting patterns in critical states to see whether there were any signs of foul play, particularly in the wake of hacking of emails at the Democratic National Committee and of senior campaign officials earlier this year. Elias wrote that no evidence of wrongdoing had emerged in their preliminary review. \nBut once Stein’s campaign formally started the recount process in Wisconsin, Elias said Clinton’s campaign would join the effort even if her top advisers did not expect the outcome to change in any of the Midwestern states that tipped the Electoral College balance to Trump. \n“We had not planned to exercise this option ourselves, but now that a recount has been initiated in Wisconsin, we intend to participate in order to ensure the process proceeds in a manner that is fair to all sides,” he said. \nClinton’s campaign plans to do the same if Stein, who has raised more than $5 million to help fund the recounts, follows through on plans to ask for the same process in Michigan and Pennsylvania. \nThe total margin in those three states was 107,00 votes out of nearly 13.8 million cast, with a combined 46 electoral votes among them – enough to give the race to Clinton had she won those three battlegrounds. \nClearly irritated by losing the popular vote, Trump suggested that the math to getting to the 270-vote margin in the Electoral College made him come up short. “It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4 states instead of the 15 states that I visited,” he tweeted. \nMeanwhile, the extraordinary feud over his pick for secretary of state hit a fevered pitch when Conway took to three Sunday television shows to attack Romney’s credentials to be the nation’s top diplomat. Conway is part of a cadre of Trump confidants who are waging an unusual public battle against Romney to influence the president-elect’s decision. \nRomney’s supporters have largely counseled Trump privately, while his opponents – Conway, former House speaker Newt Gingrich and a handful of other Trump loyalists – have gone public in recent days to stoke a revolt. \nThose opposed to Romney have been advocating Trump to reward Giuliani with the secretary of state position, stressing his loyalty against Romney’s refusal to publicly say whom he voted for in the presidential race. \n“I don’t think a cost of admission for party unity has to be the secretary of state position,” Conway said on ABC’s “This Week,” suggesting Romney went too far in questioning Trump’s character and intellect during the presidential race. “There was the ‘Never Trump’ movement and then there was Governor Mitt Romney. He went out of his way to hurt Donald Trump.” \nThe Conway offensive, which began Thursday on Twitter and continued in her three appearances Sunday, led the echo chamber of opposition to the former 2012 Republican presidential nominee. Gingrich said most Trump supporters could not countenance Romney’s selection for any high-profile posting in Trump’s new administration. “I think we would be enormously disappointed if he brought Mitt Romney into any position of authority,” Gingrich said on Fox News. \nOthers inside Trump’s orbit, particularly Vice President-elect Mike Pence, are viewed as Romney supporters, believing he has a steady hand that would benefit Trump in the turbulent world of diplomacy, according to people familiar with the dispute who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The incoming White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, also has a long-standing relationship with Romney.",

      "text": "Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Email Print \nLet’s imagine, in an alternative universe, that the media were as sympathetic to Donald Trump as they were to Barack Obama right after his election. \nThe coverage might look something like this: \nPresident-elect Trump has shown himself to be surprisingly inclusive in reaching out to former rivals who bitterly criticized him, including Mitt Romney, who called him a “fraud,” Nikki Haley, who questioned his disavowal of the KKK, and Rick Perry, who dubbed him a “cancer on conservatism.” \nPresident-elect Trump has called a temporary truce in his rhetorical war on the media, even venturing to the much-derided New York Times and describing the newspaper as a “jewel.” \nPresident-elect Trump has shown striking flexibility in rethinking some of campaign promises, abandoning his support for waterboarding, declaring an open mind on climate change and walking away from overheated threats to have Hillary Clinton prosecuted. He also agreed to keep two key parts of ObamaCare. \nEven before taking the oath, he appears to be growing into the job. Predictions Map \nSee the Fox News 2016 battleground prediction map and make your own election projections. See Predictions Map → \nNow of course such positive assessments would have to be balanced with more critical ones. One man’s post-election evolution is another man’s blatant flip-flop. A Politico headline : “15 Trump Flip-Flops in 15 Days.” \nBut the positive analyses are, shall we say, muted. \nLet’s face it, almost no one in the media expected Trump to win, and few are giving him the benefit of the doubt. \nI never believed that Trump, if he won, would seek a special prosecutor after Clinton had already been cleared by the FBI. It would look like he was seeking revenge against a rival at a time when he’d have far bigger problems to tackle. \nThere has been some legitimate focus on disappointment on the right after all those “Lock Her Up” rallies. Breitbart, Steve Bannon’s former outfit, ran a “Broken Promise” headline. But more common are a bunch of Should-Hillary-Be-Jailed-Or-Not cable segments. \nSimilarly, Trump’s evolving views on some issues have either been played down or drawn left-handed compliments, as in this column by CNN’s Fareed Zakaria: \n“One might wonder why he didn’t have that conversation during the campaign or why he pounded home the opposite views on all these topics for a year and a half. But at this point, it doesn’t matter. Trump is president-elect. We should all hope that he flip-flops some more.” The liberal Zakaria had earlier called Trump a “cancer on American democracy.” \nFrom the right, Trump critic Kathleen Parker goes off on “Donald Trump’s many campaign lies. What else can one call the promises that he now treats as alien concepts?” Though she admits she’s happier with his new positions. \nAs for Trump trying to bring establishment Republicans into his tent, the press gave him some credit on Romney for an hour or two. But now the coverage is all about whether Romney critics and Rudy Giuliani fans can derail his nomination as secretary of State. That’s a legitimate story, and the best horse race we have at the moment. But it’s still incredible that Mitt is even in the running. \nAnd it’s equally amazing that Nikki Haley, who was so critical of Trump during the campaign, was tapped as U.N. ambassador. \nOther big media narratives at the moment: \nShould Trump divest himself of his real estate empire to avoid conflicts of interest? That’s a thorny question, and some of his properties were promoted, rather than hidden, during the campaign. But the truth is it would take years to sell off his hotels and golf courses, even if he wanted to. Still, the New York Times yesterday ran a zillion-word lead story on the subject. \nShould Jared Kushner play a role in his administration? There was much teeth-gnashing about whether Trump tapping his son-in-law would violate a nepotism law, but nothing prevents the president-elect from using him in an informal role. There are questions about his complete lack of government or diplomatic experience, but Kushner did help manage a winning presidential campaign. \nShould there be a recount in Wisconsin (and Michigan and Pennsylvania)? Trump has ripped Jill Stein’s fundraising as a “scam” and chided the Clinton campaign for cooperating, even though she didn’t seek the recount and claims no evidence of foul play. But the story is somewhat overplayed because it won’t change who presides over the inauguration in January. \nI am all for aggressive coverage of new presidents. The relationship between the media and an incoming leader of the free world should always be adversarial. But anyone who thinks Trump is being covered the way President-elect Obama was has a very short memory. \nHoward Kurtz is a Fox News analyst and the host of \"MediaBuzz\" (Sundays 11 a.m. and 5 p.m. ET).

      "text": "Falcons viciously troll Browns on Twitter after Taylor Gabriel catches second TD Posted by Jesse Kramer on Nov 28, 2016 08:30 \nFalcons receiver Taylor Gabriel continued his emergence Sunday with two touchdowns and 75 yards in a 39-19 win over the Cardinals. The Falcons took to Twitter to troll the Browns, who released Gabriel during training camp in September. \n— Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) November 27, 2016 \nGabriel now has five touchdowns (four receiving, one rushing) in the last four games. \nMaking things even worse for Cleveland, Gabriel had 27 rushing yards, which would have been good for the Browns’ top rusher in three different games this season. At least Isaiah Crowell beat him out on Sunday with a whopping 44 yards on 16 carries. \nThe Falcons are not new to this. Prior to a Monday Night Football matchup with the Eagles two weeks ago, they tweeted a video of their mascot smashing a TV featuring Rocky with a hammer. Not feeling that brotherly love today. #RiseUp pic.twitter.com/bJPQI9fKzJ \n— Atlanta Falcons (@AtlantaFalcons) November 13, 2016 \nThe Eagles won that matchup 24-15 and got the last word in this trolling exchange. Feel it yet? https://t.co/kowzLsXT5L \n— Philadelphia Eagles (@Eagles) November 13, 2016 \nHowever, the Browns lost on Sunday to the Giants, falling to 0-12. So it looks like the Falcons are safe from retaliation this time. About Jesse Kramer Jesse is a senior at Northwestern University studying journalism.

(Reuters) \nPatton Oswalt apologized for a since deleted retweet about the \"long list of targets\" that terrorists have when it comes to President-elect Donald Trump's worldwide holdings.\n\"Trump has properties all over the world. Terrorists will have a long list of targets that are literally owned by POTUS and bear his name,\" a Twitter use wrote.\nOswalt responded by retweeting the tweet and adding, \"Holy f--k. Come 'n' get it, terrorists!\"\nOswalt has since deleted the tweet reported by Breitbart , and issued an apology after garnering a lot of heat on social media.\n. @pattonoswalt is calling for the slaughter of families, citizens who use #Trump 's properties. What a sad, dopey loser you are, Oswalt. pic.twitter.com/iryMJ0yTTq \n— Jon Hall (@JonREGATED) November 25, 2016 @seancartwright7 - he's an unfunny, bitter comedian. Irrelevant until he wished death upon innocents for holding different views.\n— Jon Hall (@JonREGATED) November 26, 2016 This Oswalt person is sick and dangerous. FBI should be alert @JonREGATED @pattonoswalt \n— Carole Gilman (@CaroleGilman) November 26, 2016 @JonREGATED @pattonoswalt what kind of a citizen does this towards a US President? Shouldn't he be taken in for questioning?\n— Deplorable American (@Seven_Oaks_) November 28, 2016 The actor admitted that his tweet was \"badly-worded\" saying he was just \"trying to express my sincere horror at the situation and went too ironic.\"\nDeleted my first quoted RT of this 'cuz my horrified irony landed wrong. To be clear: this is awful & people are gonna get hurt. https://t.co/ouAew1CSq1 \n— Patton Oswalt (@pattonoswalt) November 25, 2016 This isn't the first time Oswalt has voiced his opinion on Trump.\nIn April, he called Trump an \"ignorant, vengeful, racist a--hole.\"",

      "text": "Published November 28, 2016 FoxNews.com Facebook 0 Twitter 0 livefyre Email Print Elsie Mahe was found tangled in a window cord.  (GoFundMe) \nThe family of Brigham Young University running backs coach Reno Mahe said they will donate the organs of their 3-year-old daughter who has been hospitalized since a tragic accident at the family’s home last week. Elsie Mahe was playing with a friend at the family’s home when a cord from the window blinds somehow became tangled around her neck, Fox 13 reported. \nElsie’s mother, Sunny, found her daughter and began performing CPR before paramedics arrived to transport her to Primary Children’s Hospital in Salt Lake City. It was unclear as to how long she had been without oxygen, and a later MRI showed extensive brain damage. Elsie was intubated and placed on a respirator, but her condition continued to deteriorate, Fox 13 reported . The family updated followers on a GoFundMe page Sunday and said they had met with the director of the hospital’s organ donation team to discuss how their daughter can help save others. \n“The miraculous healing we have been praying for is not FOR Elsie, but FROM Elsie,” Sunny wrote on the GoFundMe page. “We met this morning with a representative from the hospital organ donation team and feel confident that this is the Lord’s will for Elsie – to be a life saving miracle for others. It is not the miracle that we wanted, but it is the one we got. It is still a miracle.”\nMore on this... An audacious vision: Researchers aim for first human eye transplant within the decade",

(Evan Vucci/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   10:09 AM \nPresident-elect Donald Trump took to Twitter Monday morning, threatening to \"terminate\" the 2014 agreement that reopened relations between Cuba and the United States if he can't get a more favorable deal. \n\"If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U.S. as a whole, I will terminate deal,\" Trump tweeted. Donald Trump talks about future relations with Cuba. (Donald Trump Twitter) \nThe comment is the latest hardline stance towards the island nation following the Friday death of longtime leader Fidel Castro. While President Obama and some other world leaders issued carefully worded statements on Castro's death, Trump's statement called him a \"brutal dictator who oppressed his own people for nearly six decades.\" \nThe tweet goes further, suggesting that he would roll back the first major thaw in U.S.-Cuba relations since Castro seized power in the late 1950s. Following months of secret meetings, President Obama and Raul Castro, who now runs the island, announced an agreement to normalize diplomatic relations and begin allowing trade and travel between the countries.",
