      "text": "Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making.\nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n———\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi \n0 Shares Email Star Comments McDonald's CEO: Chain Still Plans to Expand in the US Again \" \n24 Bodies Recovered in Oakland Warehouse Fire; Search 20 Percent Complete \" \n9 Dead, 'A Couple Dozen' Unaccounted for in Fire at Oakland Warehouse \" \nTrump Slams 'SNL' Spoof, Baldwin 'Can't Get Any Worse' \" \nLAPD Identifies USC Grad Student Who Killed Professor \" \n'You Belong': Man Offers Message of Support to Muslim Community \" \nMartin Scorsese Meets Pope Francis \" \n'Full House' Creator Buys Home Used in Show \" \nMom Fights Back Against Cruel Meme of Terminally Ill Toddler \" \nBeauty Salon Owner Learns Tips to Make Over His Business \" \nWoman Buys 23-Pound Lobster to Set Him Free \" \nMan Walks Off With $1.6 Million Pot of Gold in Apparent Theft Caught on Camera \" \nExperts Warn of Mental Health Woes as Wildfires Ravage South \" \nTenn.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.",

      "text": "NEW YORK — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. The chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 per cent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 per cent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making.\nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\nCandice Choi, The Associated Press",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. What's going on in the markets today? \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.   \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

      "title": "7 up-and-coming healthy fast food chains that should scare McDonald's",
      "text": "Salad and Go \nLegacy mega-brands like McDonald's, KFC, and Burger King have dominated the fast food industry for decades.\nBut within the last few years, many American consumers have shown a growing interest in healthier fast food that incorporates more low-calorie ingredients and fresh produce while remaining convenient and affordable.\nIn late November, top food executives from PepsiCo and Campbell Soup Company  told Fortune that cleaner food is not just a trend, but a movement. And that shift is spilling over into the fast food market too, forcing legacy chains to try to keep up. In the last four years, Taco Bell has pledged to cut artificial ingredients and use cage-free eggs, and has introduced a lower-calorie menu. McDonald's has even  worked with dietitians , removed antibiotics from its chicken, and added more salads to its menu.\nBut new healthy fast food chains are also seizing the opportunity to compete with legacy brands, creating low-calorie menus for around the same price. Though these new US chains are regional, they're  growing in popularity,  so they could spread nationwide in the coming years. \nCheck them out below. \nSalad and Go — A drive-thru salad chain Salad and Go/Facebook \nSalad and Go sells 48-ounce salads  for  around $6, as well as soups, smoothies, and breakfast items for around $4. \nSalad and Go is trying to rival more established drive-thru chains by making the ordering experience fast and convenient, cofounder  Roushan Christofellis told BI.  \nAlthough it just launched this fall , Salad and Go already has six locations in Arizona, with plans to open eight more by 2018 and to expand elsewhere in the US by 2020. \n\n\nEatsa — An automated vegetarian chain Jillian D'Onfro/Business Insider \nAt the vegetarian chain Eatsa , customers place their orders on iPads and pick up their food from automated cubbies. Human workers, though, prepare everything in the back.\nSpecializing in quinoa bowls that cost around $7, the chain's meals range from 450 to 700 calories.\nCurrently, Eatsa (which debuted in 2015) has four locations in San Francisco and Los Angeles. In late November, it added a DC location and will open  its first New York City on December 6.\n\n\nDig Inn — A farm-to-table eatery Madeline Stone / Business Insider \nWith a menu that emphasizes locally sourced vegetables, Dig Inn offers things like maple and sriracha-glazed Brussels sprouts and poached wild salmon. Diners order pre-made mains and sides at a counter, which are placed in compostable boxes.\nSince its launch in 2011, the farm-to-table chain has opened 14 locations in New York City and one in Boston. By 2018, Dig Inn's CEO Adam Eskin told BI that the company plans to open more Massachusetts locations and add others in a third state as well.\nDig Inn forms partnerships with local farmers, which allows it to keep its prices relatively low, Eskin said . However, the chain removed its small meal size option in 2015 (which cost around $6), so a plate from Dig Inn generally costs between $8-$11, which is more expensive than most food from McDonald's or Burger King. But not by much — in New York City, where real estate prices are among the highest in the country, a McDonald's Big Mac meal costs around $8.\n\n\nSee the rest of the story at Business Insider ",

      "title": "McDonald's CEO: Chain still plans to expand in the US again",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) -- Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald&apos;s is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn&apos;t yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald&apos;s Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald&apos;s USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn&apos;t gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we&apos;re seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That&apos;s what we&apos;re working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we&apos;ve been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn&apos;t up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don&apos;t think so. I&apos;m very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we&apos;ll have to see the trends. But everything we&apos;re hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald&apos;s will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We&apos;ve taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we&apos;ve made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald&apos;s with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there&apos;s that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there&apos;s plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald&apos;s food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There&apos;s no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food - what&apos;s in it, where&apos;s it come from, how&apos;s it prepared. That&apos;s not unique to the U.S. That&apos;s a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they&apos;re making.\nQ: You&apos;ve introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There&apos;s clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald&apos;s, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you&apos;re British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin&apos; Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It&apos;s a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n---\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\n ",

      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story NEW YORK \nArtisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. Related content",

      "text": "By CANDICE CHOI\nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward.\nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making.\nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi\n ",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.   \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

      "text": "View Comments \nPETALING JAYA : McDonald’s Corp has named Lionhorn Pte Ltd as the developmental licensee (DL) for its Malaysia and Singapore markets, effective Dec 1, 2016. \n“This transaction marks another milestone in our company’s ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners who share our values and vision to accelerate our growth and scale across diverse markets, drive innovation and place us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,” McDonald’s president and CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement last Friday. \nThe new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald’s business in Malaysia and Singapore on Dec 1, 2016, which includes a total of 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \nUnder the DL structure, McDonald’s transferred its ownership interest in McDonald’s Malaysia and Singapore and granted a licence to the DL to run McDonald’s restaurant operations in the two markets. \nThe DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business. It will also pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald’s. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe day-to-day management of the Malaysia and Singapore markets will be led by local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan respectively. Both Azmir and Chan have previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald’s and have more than 40 years’ experience combined. \nMcDonald’s said the changes come after a rigorous evaluation and selection process over the past year. \nAs part of its turnaround plan announced in May 2015, McDonald’s committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. \nWith this transaction, McDonald’s has now refranchised about 1,300 restaurants. \n- The Sun Daily",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

      "text": "View Comments \nPETALING JAYA : McDonald’s Corp has named Lionhorn Pte Ltd as the developmental licensee (DL) for its Malaysia and Singapore markets, effective Dec 1, 2016. \n“This transaction marks another milestone in our company’s ongoing efforts to identify strategic partners who share our values and vision to accelerate our growth and scale across diverse markets, drive innovation and place us closer to our customers and the communities we serve,” McDonald’s president and CEO Steve Easterbrook said in a statement last Friday. \nThe new DL assumed ownership of the McDonald’s business in Malaysia and Singapore on Dec 1, 2016, which includes a total of 390 restaurants, more than 80% of which are company-owned. Financial terms of the transaction were not disclosed. \nUnder the DL structure, McDonald’s transferred its ownership interest in McDonald’s Malaysia and Singapore and granted a licence to the DL to run McDonald’s restaurant operations in the two markets. \nThe DL partner will provide the capital necessary to support and grow the business. It will also pay an initial franchise fee and an ongoing royalty to McDonald’s. \nLionhorn is led by Sheik Fahd and Abdulrahman Alireza, who bring 20 years of experience as the DL for the nearly 100 McDonald’s restaurants in the Western and Southern regions of Saudi Arabia. \nThe day-to-day management of the Malaysia and Singapore markets will be led by local operating partners Azmir Jaafar and Kenneth Chan respectively. Both Azmir and Chan have previously held senior leadership positions at McDonald’s and have more than 40 years’ experience combined. \nMcDonald’s said the changes come after a rigorous evaluation and selection process over the past year. \nAs part of its turnaround plan announced in May 2015, McDonald’s committed to refranchising 4,000 restaurants by the end of 2018 with the long-term goal of becoming 95% franchised. \nWith this transaction, McDonald’s has now refranchised about 1,300 restaurants. \n- The Sun Daily ",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers.\nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits.\nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook , who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski , who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length.\nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive?\nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward.\nFindTheCompany | Graphiq Easterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us.\nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places?\nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target.\nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically?\nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well.\nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants?\nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt.\nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that?\nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That 's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making.\nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs?\nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay.\nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge.\nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds?\nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion!\nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities.\nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan.\n___\nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi",

      "text": "A view from Andy Pemberton Brands should harness Twitter, Donald Trump-style Brands such as McDonald's can learn from the way the US president-elect uses the platform to listen to his audience and test the water. 2-3 minutes Donald Trump loves Twitter. Interrupting a stream of tweeted criticism of Broadway show Hamilton and other targets of his rage, the US president-elect recently used Twitter to heap praise on Mitt Romney, raising speculation that the former presidential candidate could become secretary of state in Trump’s new Republican administration. Over the past 18 months, Trump has garnered more than 229 million mentions on Twitter , while Hillary Clinton has earned 127 million, according Brandwatch figures reported in Campaign . Trump typically posted more than 25 pieces of content a day – 17 on Twitter alone. Ninety per cent of his tweets were direct, with only 10% being retweets and almost no replies. Crucially, about 70% of Trump’s tweets were sent by the man himself; Clinton’s were generally sent by her 500-strong team. So it is perfectly natural for pundits to believe that Twitter was somehow instrumental in Trump’s victory in the US presidential election. Richard Edelman, chief executive of PR company Edelman, believes Trump’s use of the platform and reduced reliance on TV ads highlighted the power of \"peer-to-peer\" communication. This sounds exciting. Certainly, according to Bloomberg, Clinton’s TV adspend was $211.4m – more than double what Trump spent ($74m) and, lest we forget, she lost the election. So that’s it for TV ads! They are a waste of time and money! We should all prepare ourselves to be bombarded with a barrage of tweets about how terrible everyone else is. Or maybe not. \"Trump is a television creation,\" The Ad Contrarian, Bob Hoffman, says. \"Do you think he’d be president if The Apprentice was a fucking webinar?\" Critics point to the fact that, in the US, only 20% of adults have a Twitter account, and only 15% of rural adults (strong Trump supporters) and 11% of people over 50 (those most likely to vote) use the platform. Indeed, only half of Twitter’s own board use it. (Imagine being on the board of a jam factory and never eating any of the company jam!) Take away TV coverage and Trump’s tweets would have been \"dust in the wind\", Hoffman argues. But still, it’s obvious that Twitter had some kind of impact. It’s just that the impact was given the loudhailer effect by TV news reporting of the things Trump tweeted. In fact, Trump knowingly manipulated this fact two weeks ago. When he sent vice-president-elect Mike Pence to get booed at Hamilton , Trump would have known it would cause a news storm, especially after he tweeted how outraged he was about the whole business. That tweet got picked up by TV news and social media, conveniently drowning out the fact that Trump had also just settled his lawsuit over the discredited Trump University for a whopping $25m – despite saying he never would. The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 20, 2016 So how can this be of any use to McDonald’s, which has just hired 200 people to bolster its digital capability in an effort to win back young adults ? (Just one in five millennials has tried its flagship Big Mac, fact fans.) In case you are wondering, a typical McDonald’s tweet runs like this: \"We’re here for you when you are ready! What’s your go-to breakfast food?\" But maybe there is something else at work here. Using Twitter, Trump was able to poll himself. He could try out denying climate change, attacking Obamacare or threatening to throw Clinton in jail and then see how his base reacted. The louder his supporters cheered, the more Trump said the crazy things that excited his base. And the more votes he got. So while Trump worked on the content, the content (and his audience’s reaction to it) worked on him. Right now, eight of the 13 companies that have outperformed the S&P 500 five years straight are gleaning data about their many users and then using that data to seamlessly improve their customers’ experience. Every time you conduct a search on Google, you make its algorithm 0. 3% better. Amazon changes its prices 2.5 million times a day. And so on. The lesson from Twitter and Trump for McDonald’s is a simple one: identify your audience, listen to them and then, crucially, let them change you. Being so close to audiences, social media is very, very good at telling you what is going to work and what isn’t. For better or worse, that is what success looks like in 2016.

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Tags",

Q: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? A: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. Q: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? A: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. Q: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? A: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. Q: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? A: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That 's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. Q: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? A: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. Easterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. Q: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? A: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! Easterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. Kempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. ___ ",

      "text": "Source: Mike Mozart via Flickr \nThe first jolt to MCD came when McDonald’s announced that its popular breakfasts would be served all day. Then there was the talk about creating a fresher and healthier menu. The company also announced initiatives to get its eggs from less intensive producers that provide a better environment for the animals. \nAll welcome changes, and all reflected in McDonald’s stock. Shares are up 23% since announcing all-day breakfast, though they’re mostly flat in what has been a challenging year for restaurant stocks as a whole. \nBut if you look out longer, you can see the real value in MCD stock is its long-term performance. So does Nomura, which just upgraded shares from “neutral” to “buy,” in large part because the Golden Arches are innovating again. MCD Stock Needs (And Is Getting) New Ideas \nMCD is returning close to 10% a year for the past decade. That is a very respectable return, and its moves in recent quarters shows that it is committed to keeping that growth trend growing. \nAnd don’t forget: McDonald’s is no slouch on the dividend side. It is a Dividend Aristocrat, raising its dividend every year for the past 40 years. That’s a very impressive record that is matched by only a handful of companies. \nThe dividend yield on McDonald’s stock currently sits at 3.1%, which is still beating inflation by a good stretch. \nTo keep this growth trend going, MCD recently announced some new ideas to further reinforce its ambition to be a healthier fast food restaurant.",

      "text": "Shares of McDonald's Corp. MCD, +1.01% climbed 1.1% in morning trade Monday, after the fast food giant was upgraded by Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, who said investor fears about slowing same-store sales are overblown. Kalinowski raised his rating to buy from neutral, and lifted his stock price target to $139--16% above current levels--from $126. \"Our checks suggest that November should end up as one of the best same-store sales months for the quick-service burger sector in 2016, with McDonald's playing a key role in this despite lapping difficult comparisons,\" Kalinowski wrote in a note to clients. He said that although it is difficult to pinpoint the reason for the same-store sales improvement, it is nevertheless important that sales don't appear as bad as anticipated. \"Once investors obtain more comfort with this, those that have been avoiding the stock due to these difficult comparisons may choose to re-enter it,\" Hargreaves said. The stock has gained 1.2% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.49% has run up 11%.",

(AP Photo/Richard Drew) \nNEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. \nThe chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. \nMcDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook, who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski, who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. \nQ: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? \nA: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. \nEasterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. \nQ: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? \nA: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. \nQ: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? \nA: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. \nQ: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? \nA: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. \nQ: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? \nA: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. \nQ: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? \nA: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. \nEasterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. \nQ: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? \nA: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! \nEasterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. \nKempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. \n___ \nFollow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi More Headlines",

We are impressed with McDonald’s potential product pipeline heading into 2017. Big Mac and French fry line extensions, platforms for customization, fresh beef, and further menu innovation have been in test across multiple U.S. geographies. Add in a likely national rollout of its new mobile order-and-pay and we see a number of potential growth drivers for McDonald’s.\nShares of McDonald’s have 0.8% to $119.21 at 10:19 a.m. today, leaving 17% of upside to Instinet’s $139 target.",

      "text": "Shares of McDonald's Corp. (MCD) climbed 1.1% in morning trade Monday, after the fast food giant was upgraded by Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski, who said investor fears about slowing same-store sales are overblown. Kalinowski raised his rating to buy from neutral, and lifted his stock price target to $139--16% above current levels--from $126. \"Our checks suggest that November should end up as one of the best same-store sales months for the quick-service burger sector in 2016, with McDonald's playing a key role in this despite lapping difficult comparisons,\" Kalinowski wrote in a note to clients. He said that although it is difficult to pinpoint the reason for the same-store sales improvement, it is nevertheless important that sales don't appear as bad as anticipated. \"Once investors obtain more comfort with this, those that have been avoiding the stock due to these difficult comparisons may choose to re-enter it,\" Hargreaves said. The stock has gained 1.2% year to date, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average has run up 11%.\n-Tomi Kilgore;\n 0955ET\n ",

      "text": " 49 AM EST McDonald’s Is Counting On McCafe Overhaul To Spur Growth \nAs the growth contribution from its successful “all-day breakfast” move wanes, McDonald’s Corporation ( NYSE:MCD ) is looking to its stagnant coffee business to drive more sales. \nThe company will relaunch McCafe with better coffee beans and more sustainable sources, the company said. Other moves will include better deals, increased seasonal beverages, and higher levels of marketing for its coffee rewards program. \nMcDonald’s has its eye on Starbucks ( NYSE:SBUX ) and Dunkin’ Donuts ( NYSE:DNKN ) with the moves, hoping to better compete in the lucrative coffee world. From Bloomberg : \nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nAs supermarkets and other retailers cut prices and offer more prepared foods, coffee offers an attractive avenue for McDonald’s and other fast food giants to spur store traffic. As you’d expect from a low-cost chain, price will be an important factor for MCD in its revamp: \nMcDonald’s still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nSo far, analysts are skeptical over MCD’s plans. The company’s key demographic is in the low- and middle-income range, and those consumers don’t typically want to buy gourmet coffee drinks. Plus, the chain is unlikely to lure customers away from chains with more cache, like Starbucks. \nBut doubting McDonald’s has never proven to be very profitable, so investors should probably take a wait-and-see approach to how the company’s big coffee plans progress. \nMcDonald’s shares rose $0.94 (+0.80%) to $119.19   MCD has risen just 0.91%, versus an 8.4% gain   during  ",

Analysts say investor concerns about tough U.S. same-store sales comparisons will subside. They are impressed with the McDonald's U.S. plans for the next year, which include Big Mac and French fry line extensions and platforms for customization. The company will launch two news versions of the Big Mac for a limited time in early 2017: The Grand Mac and the Mac Jr. The analysts also say that with a national rollout of the company's new mobile order-and-pay, they see a number of potential growth drivers for McDonald's. Nomura also increased its price target to $139 from $126.",

      "text": "Mike Mozart/flickr \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in hopes of chipping away at Starbucks' coffee empire.\nThe company first launched its coffee brand, McCafe, eight years ago, and it now generates about $4 billion annually, or about 16% of sales per year.\nNext year it's relaunching the brand by upgrading its espresso machines and kicking off a marketing campaign that will highlight its competitive prices, Bloomberg reports .  \nFor the first quarter of the year, McDonald's will offer a promotion for $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages, according to the report. \nThat's about half the price of Starbucks. \nStarbucks Pike Place brewed coffee costs $2.10 for a grande, and specialty beverages cost upwards of $4.25 for a tall.\nMcDonald's is also hoping to improve its specialty coffee beverages with new $12,000 espresso machines. The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology. \nThe original McCafe machines cost about $13,000 . \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in the face of growing pressure from falling food prices , which has resulted in more people eating at home over restaurants. \nNOW WATCH: 9 items you shouldn't buy at Costco \n",

      "text": "Print this article Font size - 16 + 8 SHARES Share \nMcDonald’s has just released a fantastic video. It epitomizes the quintessential American value of hard work and puts forth huge support for that character trait. In the short clip, a worker gets accepted to college with the help of McDonald’s. They state it is part of their college assistance program and part of being America’s Best First Job . It’s brilliant branding and I have to say I’m impressed. \nYou know who won’t be? Those behind #FightFor15. They are going to hate this ad with a passion. Because they have tried to paint McDonald’s as a big, evil corporation who doesn’t care about their employees. That’s just not true. Many people have begun by working at places like McDonald’s. The trick is, that’s your first job. You are supposed to build up from there, not stay there and stagnate. \nFrom Louder from Crowder: \nThe cornerstone of click bait is to say how X responds to Y in the “best way possible.” But in this case, McDonald’s really does respond to #FightFor15 in the best way possible with their new spot, America’s Best First Job . If you’ve been keeping up with the movement, you likely noticed a pattern among the activists. Leftists pushing a $15 minimum wage seem to have locked onto McDonald’s as their main target (see Minimum Wage Hikes Result in McDonalds Closing Doors. We Told You… ). \nWell, McDonald’s has an answer for whiny protesters. And it’s awesome… \nMcDonald’s just McMelted the faces off of liberals worldwide. The company made its point in a not so subtle way, sure, but they kept it positive. Grilling meat byproduct and pink chicken ooze at McDonald’s isn’t meant to be a career, it’s supposed to be a stepping stone on your way to a grown up job. \nThe thing about minimum wage jobs is they require minimum skills. McDonald’s gets it, you and I get it, even James Franco gets it . The only ones not getting it? Soppy leftist milquetoasts. \nMcDonald’s has less than no patience with these whining protesters and I don’t blame them in the least. Working at McDonald’s was always meant to be a job for kids, so they could find out what a hard work ethic amounted to. It was never meant to be a career move or to feed a family of four. My son, when he started out, worked a fast food job for all of two weeks. Then he went into business for himself programming. He learned his lesson fast. Unfortunately, there seem to be many on the Left who never learn. \nMcDonald’s pays minimum wage to begin with because the required skill set is, well, minimal. As radical protesters keep bullying McDonald’s and others to raise the minimum wage, these businesses are now being forced to automate many of those jobs. No one can afford to pay $15 an hour for this type of work and stay in business. \nI think what McDonald’s does for kids is fantastic and I love their ad. I love it even more because the Left is having a meltdown over it. 8 SHARES",

      "text": "Courtney Harrell: I'm still questioning where 'The Voice' is going to take me, I'd love to see We McDonald win By       when the eleventh season's Top 8 artists were determined. ADVERTISEMENT Courtney, a 36-year-old professional songwriter from Boston, MA   Los Angeles, CA, landed in the bottom three with Austin Allsup from Texas and Aaron Gibson from Georgia based on home viewer votes cast following Monday night's Top 10 performance show. After the three artists sang a survival song, America tweeted to \"instantly save\" Aaron for the third week in a row. Aaron represents Miley Cyrus ' team, while both Austin and Courtney were on Blake Shelton 's team. For her last regular performance on the show, Courtney sang \"If I Could Turn Back Time\" by Cher, and for her \"Instant Save\" song on the most recent live results show, she belted out \"Bless the Broken Road\" by Rascal Flatts. In addition to talking to Reality TV World about whether she was surprised to be eliminated , Courtney spoke with reporters   her experience on The Voice . Below is what she had to say. Your performance of \"Bless the Broken Road\" was really beautiful, I thought. Would you ever consider a country career? Courtney Harrell : Yes. I would consider my career taking me into the country world, but I don't know. You know, Austin may laugh when I say this because he was surprised that I know this phrase, but they have one that says, you know, \"All you need in country is three chords and the truth.\" And the truth is, I'm not a country singer. But I do share similarities and I like to sing with truth in everything that I'm doing, every song that I take on. And if that led me to a song that might be considered traditionally country in the way \"Bless the Broken Road\" is... I would love to do more songs like that. But, you know, it's funny it came to the point where, you know, every time I got to the chorus in practicing that song I would break down and cry because it really is my life leading up to even being on The Voice . And so, I would love to find songs that suit me in that way, suit my story that my heart can shine on that and my voice can support what my heart is trying to sing. And, you know, if that means I end up in country in some way, shape or form, then absolutely. But it definitely isn't something that is on my immediate to-do list, to be known as a country artist. You had been performing in the background musically for a long time. Where do you think this Voice experience is going to lead you? What do you see in your musical future? Courtney Harrell : Wow. I'm still questioning where it's going to take me. Again, like, I didn't come here with, you know, the intention to win the show and/or once I do well, I'm going to just start off with this big musical career that I never got to fully live out. I do think there is some singing in my future. I don't know in what capacity. I do have a passion for writing and for singing. I think I'll always do that. Whether or not I want to do that in the same way some of the other contestants have or even the people that I write for, I know it entails a lot. And one of the acts that I sang background for was John Legend . And, you know, it's a lot of work. It's a lot of work and lot of putting yourself out there. And I'm trying to figure out whether or not that's in my future in the way that it is for some of the others. But I do, in addition to this, have a tremendous love for teaching. I was a schoolteacher before this. And coaching other artists, I was doing that as well. And, you know, I may go on and expand in that. I haven't figured it out quite yet how I'm going to do it. So you're not really sure whether you'll be releasing music of your own? Courtney Harrell : I think I owe it to myself and to the people who have followed me and have grown to love me to release the songs that I've written and to just to share my heart in that way. I just am unsure on how my career as a singer is going to look. You know, is it something that I've put out just to say that I've done it and I go back to writing, or is it something that I'm going to go full throttle with? And I haven't figured that out yet. Now that you're getting back to normal as more of, like, a behind-the-scenes person writing for other artists, whom do you think is your frontrunner to win The Voice ? Who is your favorite to win the whole thing? Courtney Harrell : I don't have a favorite, I think. And I'm not saying that to be politically correct. I really do think it's anyone's game. They're all incredibly talented and incredibly, you know, just deserving. And the other reason I don't have a favorite is I know how hard everyone has to work to progress in the show. No one is there off of raw talent alone. They're all there because they're putting in the work. And when I consider, you know, who deserves to win, I consider how hard have you worked? And they all are doing that. And so, I would be thrilled with whomever walks away with that title. Okay, it is politically correct, but it is the truth. And the one thing I can promise you is that I will be truthful with you. And to further that truth, we all are very close to each other, and I know some people have a hard time grasping that because the world sees a competition. And in essence it is, but none of us carry it that way. Like, you know, I'll give you an example of [ We McDonald ], who I would love to see win the show. And what We says to me after -- she realized that I had confidence issues -- was how much I believed in everyone else around me. She said, \"Now I just wish you could believe in yourself in the same way you believe in us, you know, and then you could win.\" So for her to say that -- and she's slated as the one to win -- like, we all just really love each other. And Austin is right about the people who work for The Voice . They foster that love and that relationship. I've been in the music business, like, mainstream music business, for a very long time. The Voice is hands down the most loving, nurturing, encouraging, affirming musical environment I have ever been in. And if I will miss anything about being on the show, it will be being in that beautiful family environment. So while it is politically correct, I am most definitely telling you the truth... I don't have a favorite. I really don't. I really don't. They're all brilliant. Whoever wins, I hope I'm writing for them.

      "text": "Mike Mozart/flickr \nMcDonald's is making changes to its coffee line in hopes of chipping away at Starbucks' coffee empire. \nThe company first launched its coffee brand, McCafe, eight years ago, and it now generates about $4 billion annually, or about 16% of sales per year. \nNext year it's relaunching the brand by upgrading its espresso machines and kicking off a marketing campaign that will highlight its competitive prices, Bloomberg reports . \nFor the first quarter of the year, McDonald's will offer a promotion for $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages, according to the report. \nThat's about half the price of Starbucks. \nStarbucks Pike Place brewed coffee costs $2.10 for a grande, and specialty beverages cost upwards of $4.25 for a tall. \nMcDonald's is also hoping to improve its specialty coffee beverages with new $12,000 espresso machines. The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology.",

      "text": "Video Of McDonald's McRib Lover Pleading To City Council To Bring Sandwich Back December 5, 2016 \nThis is a video from Thanksgiving Day 2015 of Zanthe Pajarillo pleading with the Santa Clarita, California city council to reach out to the area's McDonald's restaurant managers and urge them to bring the McRib back to their stores (last year individual franchise owners and managers were given the option to sell the McRib or not, and only 55% of locations decided to participate). As far as city council videos go, this one is pretty solid. Sure there were no fisticuffs, but there's no denying Zanthe's passion about the McRib. It made me wish I was as passionate about something as she is about this sandwich. I'm not though, I hardly get excited about anything but going back to sleep whenever I'm awake. Eight out of ten of the country's top doctors suspect I was been born without emotions. All ten plus five dentists agree I've got a penis though. \nKeep going for the video. \nThanks to Allyson S, who agrees McDonald's needs to stop dicking around and bring back the Arch Deluxe already.",

      "text": "• An exclusive sit-down with McDonald’s CEO \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nMcDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand. The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. \nThe chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. \nThe company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move it said “showcases the company's passion for elevating the cafe experience.” McDonald's now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. \nIn the U.S., McDonald's is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent-tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. \nBut the typical McDonald's diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens. Customers are looking for something that's affordable and familiar, he said. \n“It's going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,” Slabaugh said. “I don't expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.”",

The machines are better at steaming milk than the restaurants' current equipment, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut the new machines will likely draw some ire from franchisees, who almost always foot the bill for new technology.",

      "text": "Image courtesy of Michael Kappel \nDecember 5, 2016 12:10 pm EST By Laura Northrup @lnorthrup espresso markup mccafe franchisees coffee machines mcdonald's \nJust like better burger joints have nibbled away at McDonald’s sandwich business, competitors with a wider variety of coffee options are attracting the caffeine-seeking consumers away from the Golden Arches. Now the fast food giant wants to re-establish its coffee bona fides, investing in equipment to help stores compete with the likes of Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nWhile Americans know McCafé as the brand on their brewed coffee or the occasional pumpkin spice latte, it’s a fancier line and even a standalone higher-end café in international markets. The Hong Kong branch teamed up with hazelnut confectioner Ferrero to make hazelnut-themed coffee beverages and confections a few years ago , for example. In Australia, the company used the McCafé brand on an experimental restaurant marketing healthier fare, calling it “The Corner by McCafé.” \nThat’s probably bad news to franchisees, who would like to do away with the whole McCafé line to simplify processes behind the counter. Instead, according to Bloomberg , what they’ll be getting are upgraded McCafé machines that make a wider variety of fancy beverages from the McCafé menu and cost $12,000. \nThat will only be good news to franchisees if the new machines are the product that was tested in Chicago earlier this year, which allows customers to press a button and make their own mochas and lattes . \nEspresso-based beverages have a higher markup, which is why fast food eateries push them. McDonald’s wants to sell more of them, and plans to increase its offerings of seasonal beverages, along with a better coffee rewards program. ",

      "title": "The Big Mac's 50-Year Anniversary and Fresh Meat Could Supersize McDonald's Profits in 2017",
      "text": "Selling fresh beef and new versions of the Big Mac -- the high-calorie fast food creation that turns 50 years old next year -- could do their part to fatten up McDonald's ( MCD ) profits in 2017.\n\"We are impressed with McDonald's potential product pipeline heading into 2017. Big Mac and French fry line extensions, platforms for customization, fresh beef, and further menu innovation have been in test across multiple U.S. geographies,\" said Nomura analyst Mark Kalinowski in a note on Monday, \"along with a likely national rollout of its new mobile order-and-pay and we see a number of potential growth drivers for McDonald's.\"\nThe analyst upgraded his rating on McDonald's to buy from neutral.\nIt's hard to argue that the Golden Arches doesn't have a supersized amount of initiatives on tap next year that could jump-start slowing sales.\nMcDonald's will launch two new versions of the Big Mac nationwide for a limited time in early 2017. The Grand Mac, which rests on a larger sesame seed bun, is made with two beef patties that weigh in at one-third of a pound compared to a traditional Big Mac, which has two, 1.6-ounce beef patties. The Mac Jr. is a essentially a single-layer Big Mac. Each sandwich will have the traditional Big Mac sauce.\nMcDonald's started testing the Grand Mac and Mac Jr. in more than 120 restaurants in the central Ohio and Dallas areas in April.\nMeanwhile, McDonald's has expanded a test of fresh beef -- which began at 55 locations in Dallas -- to about 75 restaurants in the Tulsa, Okla., area. \"Should McDonald's figure out ways to address the not-insignificant logistical and supply chain challenges involved, perhaps never-frozen beef gets somewhat of a bigger roll-out over time in 2017. McDonald's could also launch a $1 any size soft drink campaign and French Fry line extensions (such as the successful garlic fries in San Francisco ) nationally in 2017, said Kalinowski. Factor in the upcoming launch of mobile order and pay functionality, and suddenly McDonald's stock is looking a touch more appetizing after a disappointing 2016. McDonald's stock has been unchanged so far this year due to a stretch of slowing sales in its largest market of the U.S. as more people are eating at home amid falling grocery prices. The Dow Jones Industrial Average , in which McDonald's is a component, has tacked on 7.5% year to date. The fast food giant's U.S. sales rose 1.3% in the third quarter, a slower pace than the 1.8% increase seen in the second quarter. In the first quarter, McDonald's U.S. same-store sales rose 5.4%. \"We are mindful of the headwinds, most notably in the U.S.,\" McDonald's CEO Steve Easterbrook told analysts on a conference call in October.",

Artisan burger buns, ... more Photo: Richard Drew, AP McDonald's CEO: Chain still plans to expand in the US again 1 / 2 Back to Gallery NEW YORK (AP) — Artisan burger buns, cage-free eggs and table service are some of the changes McDonald's is promising in the U.S. as it scrambles to update its image and win back customers. The chain, based in a Chicago suburb, has seen customer visits slip, with its flagship U.S. market of particular concern as tastes change and competition intensifies. The rollout of an all-day breakfast menu last fall hasn't yet translated to a bump in customer visits. McDonald's Corp. CEO Steve Easterbrook , who took over last year, and Chris Kempczinski , who takes over as president of McDonald's USA on Jan. 1, talked with The Associated Press about the recent changes. Their answers were edited for length. Q: Customer traffic in the U.S. has been down for the past of couple years, and hasn't gone up despite the turnaround efforts. When do you expect the figure to turn positive? A: Kempczinski: The trends we're seeing over time have been in the right direction. When exactly that tips over to positive, to me the key is not just once, but can it consistently be positive? That's what we're working toward. FindTheCompany | Graphiq Easterbrook: For large periods of this year, we've been taking market share out of our near competition, which is a very important measure for us. Q: You said you took market share, but traffic isn't up. Is there a broader change happening where people are just going to supermarkets or other places? A: Kempczinski: I don't think so. I'm very optimistic about the opportunities. A number of retailers earlier in the year talked about a slowing of traffic. And now obviously there are lots of questions about what happens post-election. So we'll have to see the trends. But everything we're hearing from customers is that they still love going out, particularly millennials. They eat out more than any other consumer group we target. Q: You have more than 14,100 restaurants in the U.S., but the store count is on track to shrink for the second straight year after decades of expansion. Do you think McDonald's will eventually start expanding again domestically? A: Easterbrook: We've taken time to right-size the estate. As part of the turnaround plan, we've made some of those tougher decisions (to close restaurants) to get our foundation strong. I think if we look into the out years, we will be net adding restaurants. Certainly globally, but in the U.S. as well. Q: How much room do you see for expansion in the U.S.? It seems like the industry is becoming more fragmented. Is there a place for a McDonald's with 14,000, 15,000 or 16,000 restaurants? A: Kempczinski: We only have about a 10 percent share of the total market in terms of eating out. So if you look at me, there's that 90 percent of the market that we still have an opportunity to go after. So I think there's plenty of growth, no doubt. Q: Another issue is the image of McDonald's food and its association with junk food. How much of an issue is that? A: Easterbrook: There's no doubt consumers are increasingly interested in and knowledgeable about their food — what's in it, where's it come from, how's it prepared. That's not unique to the U.S. That 's a global movement, and one that we support. The more informed people are, then the better choices they're making. Q: You've introduced more premium burgers with the growth of all the \"better burgers\" out there now. Five years down the road, will people still be ordering Big Macs? A: Kempczinski: I would predict in 10 years, we would be selling many, many times more Big Macs than any other type of burger on the premium end of the menu. This is an opportunity for us to continue to offer options. The Big Mac is here to stay. Easterbrook: There's clearly a market for a more premium priced burger with more premium ingredients. If we can bring to our menu the quality ingredients, but maintain the value of McDonald's, then I think that gives us a competitive edge. Q: Steve, you're British, and the executive many believe will be the next CEO of Coke is British. The CEO of Dunkin' Donuts is British. Is there something culturally about a British management style that is good for turnarounds? A: Kempczinski: It's a British invasion! Easterbrook : I would put it down more to coincidence than reading too much into it. We are a significant international business, and I would imagine an increasing proportion of our senior leadership will come from all around the world. I happen to be British. Our next leader could be one of a number of nationalities. Kempczinski: Although, now he is a Cubs fan. ___ Follow Candice Choi at www.twitter.com/candicechoi Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

No one was injured, Canton firefighters said. \nCause of the fire still is being investigated, but it's suspected that equipment on the roof malfunctioned and started the blaze. \nThe fire was reported at 12:03 a.m. When firefighters arrived there was heavy smoke from the roof and heavy fire in the dining area. The roof had collapsed into the dining area, fire officials said. \nCheck back at cantonrep.com and The Canton Repository for more details. \nReach The Canton Repository's newsroom at newsroom@cantonrep.com \nOn Twitter: @CantonRepdotcom",

      "title": "McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand as it lags Starbucks",
      "text": "The Washington Post McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand as it lags Starbucks McDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand — part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. 5   (mcdonalds.com) The company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. Coffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. McCafe is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" Re-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. McDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic. McDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. McDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafe brand . The company is planning a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said. (Pedestrians walk past a Starbucks coffee shop in New York; the coffee company is targeted every holiday season for its politics. Bloomberg photo by Victor J. Blue) The chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants , said in October that it would buy all of its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald's sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the U.S. this fall — the first time it's done so in three years. The company opened its first stand-alone McCafe location in Toronto last year, a move that it said \"showcases the company's passion for elevating the cafe experience.\" McDonald's now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafe locations even bake McCafe pastries in house. In the U.S., McDonald's is upgrading its espresso machines with equipment that creates more consistent -tasting drinks, Cunningham said. The new gear, which has better milk-steaming technology and can make a wider variety of drinks, costs about $12,000 apiece. But the typical McDonald's diner is a low- to middle-income consumer and not adventurous when it comes to coffee, said Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc. Customers are looking for something that's affordable and familiar, he said. \"It's going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,\" Slabaugh said. \"I don't expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.\" (c) 2016, Bloomberg · Leslie Patton / The Washington Post",

      "text": "Aladdin’s Eatery to Fill Former McDonald’s Spot at Cleveland Clinic Posted By Douglas Trattner on Mon, Dec 5, 2016 at 12:01 PM click to enlarge A little over a year ago, Cleveland Clinic made the controversial decision to give McDonald’s the boot after 20 years by not renewing its lease. The decision, the hospital said, was intended to promote healthier choices by patients, employees and visitors in an attempt to curtail chronic disease. Now we have learned what will replace it: Aladdin’s Eatery . “We are proud to have been chosen by the Clinic to open an Aladdin’s restaurant in the former McDonald’s space,” explains Gaelle Nasr, marketing manager for the locally based Mediterranean restaurant chain. “This location will feature our award-winning menu with modified versions of several dishes that comply with the Clinic’s food court policies.” At nearly a dozen locations, Aladdin’s Eatery offers freshly prepared Lebanese-American foods with a wide selection of vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free options, making them a great fit for the health-focused Clinic. That location, as well as a new Strongsville shop in the Pearl South Plaza Shopping Center, is expected to open in late winter or early spring.",

      "text": "McDonald’s Hits Refresh on McCafe (MCD, SBUX) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 12:31 PM EST \nAccording to a recent article in Bloomberg, McDonald's Corporation ( MCD ) is seeking to refresh its McCafé coffee concept in order to compete with Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX ) and Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc. ( DNKN ). This is expected to include increased promotions and more emphasis on a price advantage over Starbucks. \nConsumers have differences in taste when it comes to coffee, which often leads to loyalty to one brand over another. While some consumers feel as though Starbucks coffee tastes burnt, other consumers will never give up their daily Starbucks ritual and continue to pay a premium for higher quality coffee (compared to peers). It’s often a matter of Starbucks vs. Dunkin’ Donuts when it comes to coffee; McCafé is there as a low-priced and convenient option. The lower prices for McCafé opens a wide door, especially in today's cost-conscious consumer environment, but that door would be opened even wider if convenience improved. \nWhile it’s possible to visit a drive-thru for coffee in the morning, many of the customers on that line will be ordering breakfast sandwiches, which slows down the process. McCafé’s best shot at long-term success might be as small standalone drive-thru locations. The employee and retail costs would be low, and by only offering McCafé items, the ordering process would be expedited, which would improve the customer experience. \nMcDonald’s was just upgraded to “buy” from “neutral” by Nomura. The price target was raised to “buy” from “neutral,” but this was based on McDonald’s as a whole, and the analyst cited new burger innovations and the expected rollout of a smartphone ordering system in 2017 as catalysts. \nThe chart below includes 1-year stock performance and dividend yield for the aforementioned companies: 1-Year Stock Performance",

      "text": "Nomura Upgrades McDonald’s (MCD) By Dan Moskowitz | December 5, 2016 — 12:17 PM EST \nMcDonald's Corporation ( MCD ) is moving higher today—up 1.07% at the time of this writing—based on a recent upgrade. McDonald’s has been at the forefront of news headlines recently, which relates to the implementation of self-ordering kiosks and whether or not that was a result of a minimum wage of $15 per hour being implemented in some cities and states. Either way, it’s a cost-cutting measure for McDonald’s, and based on the restaurant chain’s reputation for poor customer service, this implementation is highly unlikely to negatively impact consumer opinions on customer service at McDonald's. On the headwind side, McDonald’s must contend with the rise of the health-conscious consumer and increased completion. Traditional foes remain a threat, but Shake Shack poses the biggest long-term threat. Based on these conditions, an upgrade is welcomed by McDonald’s and its investors. \nNomura analyst Mark Kalinowski wrote the following in a note to clients: “We are impressed with McDonald's potential product pipeline heading into 2017. Big Mac and French fry line extensions, platforms for customization, fresh beef and further menu innovation have been in test across multiple U.S. geographies. Add in a likely national rollout of its new mobile order-and-pay and we see a number of potential growth drivers for McDonald's.” \nBased on that information, Kalinowski has upgraded MCD to “buy” from “neutral” and increased his price target to $139 from $126. MCD is currently trading at $119.50. According to TipRanks, Kalinowski has a success rate of 72% on his calls since 2010, and his average annual return per recommendation is 9.9%. \nMCD has appreciated 1.56% over the past 12 months and currently offers a dividend yield of 3.18%.",

      "text": "Zhang Peng | LightRocket | Getty Images \nMcDonald's McCafe concept is getting a makeover. \nThe burger chain is slated to revamp its $4 billion coffee brand in 2017 as part of an effort to take on rivals Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts , Bloomberg reports. \nThe Golden Arches is \"recommitting\" to McCafe, a spokeswoman told CNBC. \n\"We know preferences are changing and people today are looking for great taste, high quality, value, and even more choice and flexibility than ever before,\" she said. \"In order to evolve with those changes, we are enhancing the McCafé experience. This includes new seasonal flavors and enhancements to our beverage line up, a focus on sustainable sourcing of our espresso and coffee beans, a rewards program through our mobile app, and training crew members to deliver delicious beverages and great service for our guests.\" \nIn the first quarter of 2017, the company will offer $1 any-size McCafe signature blend coffee and $2 small specialty coffee — including lattes and mochas — as part of a limited-time promotion. \nMcDonald's has not traditionally been the go-to source for higher quality coffee beverages, but the burger joint hopes that this shake-up could help boost its coffee business. \nThe coffee brand is \"a very important piece,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, told Bloomberg . \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\" \nSales at burger chains have grown 3.3 percent in the last year, a fraction of the 10 percent growth coffee cafes have seen, according to Bloomberg, which cited the research firm Technomic. \nMcDonald's has attempted to gain traction with consumers by offering a buy-five, get one free deal for its McCafe beverages. Traction in this area would be helpful as the benefits from McDonald's all-day breakfast promotion are starting to fizzle. \nLast quarter, McDonald's same-store sales rose 3.5 percent, with across-the-board improvement in all its global sectors, however, U.S. growth was more tepid. U.S. sales gained only 1.3 percent, proving that McDonald's isn't immune to persistently soft traffic within the U.S. restaurant industry. \nThe Golden Arches' cafe brand isn't the only aspect of the company getting an upgrade. The burger chain revealed last month that its restaurants will be getting revamped as part of an effort to become a \"modern and progressive burger company.\" \nMcDonald's will be adding self-service ordering kiosks, craft burgers and table service to its stores. \n\"It's going to continue to be a slow build for them, especially in this type of environment where the customer expects a deal,\" Will Slabaugh, analyst at Stephens Inc., told Bloomberg said of the McCafe shift. \"I don't expect that to be a huge needle mover for them.\"",

      "text": "Home / Badge Abuse / McDonald’s Employee Charged with 2 Counts of Battery — For Putting Mustard in a Cop’s Drink McDonald’s Employee Charged with 2 Counts of Battery — For Putting Mustard in a Cop’s Drink Matt Agorist December 5, 2016 1 Comment \nTopeka, KS — If a disgruntled fast food employee put mustard in the drink of a person they did not like, they would be fired and the person who got the drink would likely have very minimal civil recourse. However, if the person who had the mustard in their drink is a police officer — the offending fast food worker can and will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, or further; as is the case in Topeka. \nJonathan Gill, a 26-year-old McDonald’s employee was fired last week after he put mustard in a Topeka Police Officer’s drink as well as a Kansas Highway Patrol Troopers. His termination is certainly warranted. However, days after he was fired, a pro-cop Facebook page posted an image the officer took of the mustard in his drink and the outrage began. \nThe Facebook group Kansas GOING BLUE posted the photo the Sunday before last saying “a McDonald’s here in Kansas just served a Law Enforcement Officer on duty a Dr. Pepper with Mustard in a drive thru order. This is extremely unacceptable!!” \nNo one here is arguing that what Gill did was right or just. However, the subsequent reaction by police after this photo went viral is over the top. \nFor putting mustard in a soda, Gill was arrested and booked into jail on Friday. He was charged with two counts of battery against a law enforcement officer. \nAccording to the Kansas State Law, the definition of Battery is as follows: (1) Knowingly or recklessly causing bodily harm to another person; or (2) knowingly causing physical contact with another person when done in a rude, insulting or angry manner; Gill putting mustard in a soda hardly constitutes knowingly causing bodily harm and the very fact that police are attempting to charge him for this, speaks volumes. Had Gill known that the officers were allergic to mustard and maliciously put the condiment in their drinks to deliberately hurt them, this would be a different story. However, it is clear that this is not the case. What this case illustrates is the special treatment of law enforcement and their ability to use the law to retaliate against those who would mock or prank them. Mustard is a food. It is not a poison or bodily fluid that could actually cause harm, as it is meant to be eaten. Again, Gill was not justified in putting mustard in someone’s drink. But, does he really deserve two counts of battery against a law enforcement officer? Also, could a citizen expect these charges against someone who put mustard in their drink? If a citizen went to a police department or called 9-1-1 to report mustard in their drink they would most likely be met with laughter or ridicule. They might even be charged with abuse of an emergency hotline. The special treatment of police in America has been coming to a head, and this is one more example of it. In states across the U.S., legislators are proposing and passing Blue Lives Matter laws to give police the status of protected class. Per the ridiculously unnecessary Blue Lives Matter legislation, the voluntarily undertaken occupations of police officer, emergency responder, and firefighter are protected against hate crimes the way historically persecuted categories like race, gender, creed, religion, and sexual orientation have been — making crimes specifically targeting cops hate crimes with enhanced penalties in the eyes of the law. In Louisiana, a homeless man was the first to be charged under the state’s Blue Live Matter law. For being drunk, pounding on a window, calling a female officer “a dumb c__t” and another officer “a dumb n____r,” p olice charged Raul Delatoba with “simple criminal damage to property, disturbing the peace, and a felony-level hate crime.” It seems police in Kansas are also attempting to set an example for the masses — cross us and we will flex our blue privilege to bury you.

      "text": "McDonald's, losing ground in its battle for coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafé brand — part of a bid to challenge Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts. The company will reintroduce the McCafé concept next year, about eight years after it debuted across the United States. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival.\n\"We're really excited about the McCafé brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice-president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafé campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said.\nCoffee is still a booming business in the U.S., but fast-food companies haven't been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 per cent last year, compared with an almost 10 per cent jump for coffee cafés, according to research firm Technomic. Though McCafé generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said.\nStarbucks and Dunkin' Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald's offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn't become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks.\nMcCafé is \"a very important piece,\" Cunningham said. \"It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.\"\nRe-emphasizing coffee is crucial at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also are increasingly selling prepared meals, adding to the competition.\nMcDonald's is looking to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the U.S. It's also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. The all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 per cent last quarter, and McDonald's is facing declining foot traffic.\nMcDonald's isn't alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle's Best drinks in 2013, including flavoured lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Canadian coffee chain Tim Hortons, though the two brands remain distinct.\nMcDonald's still plans to emphasize its price advantage over Starbucks as it retools the McCafé brand. The company is planning a $1 US drip coffee and $2 US small specialty-beverage deal for the first quarter of next year, Cunningham said.\nThe company opened its first standalone McCafé location in Toronto last year, a move that it said \"showcases the company's passion for elevating the café experience.\" McDonald's now sells Americanos and shots of espresso across its Canadian restaurants. The McCafé locations even bake McCafé pastries in house.\nBloomberg",

ET Why McDonald’s Could Gain 17% By Ben Levisohn \nInstinet’s Mark Kalinowski and Ryan Kidd explain why they upgraded McDonald’s ( MCD ) to Buy from Neutral: Getty Images \nWe are upgrading McDonald’s (MCD US) to Buy from Neutral (TP to $139 from $126), based upon our view that investor concerns about tough U.S. same-store sales comparisons to be lapped in Q4 2016 and Q1 2017 will subside, and our encouragement surrounding much of McDonald’s U.S. plans for the next 12 months. We are impressed with McDonald’s potential product pipeline heading into 2017. Big Mac and French fry line extensions, platforms for customization, fresh beef, and further menu innovation have been in test across multiple U.S. geographies. Add in a likely national rollout of its new mobile order-and-pay and we see a number of potential growth drivers for McDonald’s. \nShares of McDonald’s have 0.8% to $119.21 at 10:19 a.m. today, leaving 17% of upside to Instinet’s $139 target.

      "title": "The West St. Paul woman who became a McDonald's billionaire",
      "text": "Joan Mansfield was a West St. Paul girl. The blonde beauty, born in the city in 1928, was the daughter of a railroad worker and a violin teacher. She dreamed of being an ice skater, or maybe a veterinarian. \nIn her 20s, she had a job playing the organ at the Criterion Restaurant on University Avenue. \nAnd by 55, she was the largest individual shareholder of McDonald's, in possession of more money than you could spend in a hundred lifetimes. She made donations so large, they set records, giving away $2 billion to the Salvation Army alone. \nIt all started in St. Paul. \nIt was in 1957, in the Criterion dining room, when Joan first met Ray Kroc, the man who made McDonald's an American icon. At the time, he was a traveling salesman, trying to sell franchises of the fledgling burger stand. Ray was also a piano player, and from the minute he saw Joan, he was smitten. There was a 26-year age difference, and both were married at the time, but Ray was relentless. \nTheir relationship, and Joan's legendary philanthropy, are at the center of a new book by Lisa Napoli — \"Ray & Joan: The Man Who Made the McDonald's Fortune and the Woman Who Gave It All Away.\" \nNapoli joined MPR News guest host Marianne Combs to explain the tumultuous history behind the success of McDonald's and Joan's philanthropic goals. \nIt may have been love at first sight on Ray's part, but their relationship took a long time to come together. Joan's first husband, Rawland Smith, was actually in charge of running McDonald's ninety-third store, in St. Louis Park, Minn. Rawland and Joan then moved to Rapid City to open South Dakota's first McDonald's. In that time, Ray had gotten divorced and re-married — \"he couldn't stand to be a bachelor,\" Napoli said. \nWhen Joan finally accepted Ray's proposal — six years after she rejected his first one, and twelve years after they met — Ray sent his lawyer ask his then-wife for a divorce. Ray and Joan married in 1969. \nShe was a bleeding heart, Napoli said, and he was a ferocious drinker. Their relationship was volatile and charged. At one point, Joan tried to file for divorce. \nInstead, Napoli said, \"she stayed and she started an alcoholism education charity.\" And she didn't just write checks: She helped produce addiction treatment videos that were ahead of their time. \nShe saw media \"as a way to describe to people what addiction was — giving it a name and showing people that they could help. She convened addiction specialists in the '70s, at a time when this was not something commonly spoken about.\" \nShe worked with filmmakers to produce films about addiction that aired on national television. \n\"Instead of looking at just how to solve her own problem, she looked at how to turn her pain into something that was useful for the world at large,\" Napoli said. \nHer philanthropy became more political after Ray's death in 1984. She became the first individual to give a million dollars to the Democratic party, and she was active in anti-nuclear campaigns. \n\"She was very interested in causes that Ray probably would not have been so keen on,\" Napoli said. \"She kept her politics at bay while her husband was alive, because she felt it would be disrespectful.\" \nJoan died in 2003 at 75, having donated billions of dollars to causes from AIDS treatment to alcohol addiction to public radio. \nThough she had a complicated relationship with the company that made her a billionaire — she called McDonald's a chauvinistic corporation — the restaurant chain issued a press release after her death: \"The world has lost a true humanitarian, and McDonald's has lost a true friend.\" \nFor more about Joan Kroc, her philanthropy and the rise of McDonald's, use the audio player above to listen to the full interview with Lisa Napoli. \nSign up to get an exclusive weekly book pick, literary news and event details.

      "text": "Pin it Share Here are some of the stocks the Yahoo Finance team will be watching for you today. Aetna ( AET ) and Humana ( HUM ) shares are in focus this morning. The two health insurance giants’ legal battle with the Justice Department over their planned $37 billion merger begins to unfold in court today. The key issue in the antitrust trial is whether Medicare Advantage customers will face higher prices and lower benefits if Aetna and Humana are allowed to merge. ExxonMobil’s ( XOM ) chairman and chief executive Rex Tillerson is among the candidates being considered for Secretary of State as President-elect Donald Trump looks to fill the top diplomatic job. Tillerson who joined Exxon in 1975, is set to retire next year. McDonald’s ( MCD ) shares were higher this morning after Nomura turned bullish on the fast-food chain, upgrading the stock to “buy” from “neutral” and raised its price target to $139 from $126 a share. The investment firm is optimistic that same-store sales will improve and is encouraged by potential menu updates in 2017, such as the new burgers and and the roll out of its smartphone ordering system. FairPoint Communications ( FRP ) soared in early trading. Consolidated Communications ( CNSL ) is buying the broadband service provider in an all-stock deal valued at $1.5 billion, which also includes debt. Apple ( AAPL ) stock is also on investors’ watch list. We’re learning a bit more about Apple’s interest in developing technology for self-driving cars. In a letter to safety regulators, Apple reveals it is “investing heavily in the study of machine learning and automation”in areas including transportation. An Apple spokesman said the company wants to work with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration to define best practices for the autonomous driving industry. ",

      "text": "McDonald's revamps $4 billion McCafe brand Video Photo A McDonald’s restaurant sign is seen at a McDonald’s restaurant in Del Mar, California April 16, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake Bloomberg News Dec 5, 2016 at 5:02 pm | Print View \nMcDonald’s Corp., losing ground in its battle for the nation’s coffee drinkers, is planning to shake up its McCafe brand — part of a bid to challenge Starbucks Corp. and Dunkin’ Donuts. \nThe company will reintroduce the McCafe concept next year, about eight years after it debuted nationwide. The push follows efforts to upgrade its java and get more of its beans from sustainable sources, mimicking a move by its Seattle-based rival. \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” said Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain’s coffee rewards program, she said. \nCoffee still is a booming business in this country, but fast-food companies haven’t been able to capitalize on much of that growth. Sales at burger chains rose just 3.3 percent last year, compared with an almost 10 percent jump for coffee cafes, according to research company Technomic. \nThough McCafe generates $4 billion annually in U.S. sales, it could better cater to customer needs, Cunningham said. \nStarbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts have attracted customers with high-margin espresso, lattes and mochas. Though McDonald’s offers a wide range of coffees these days, it hasn’t become as much of a go-to source for upscale drinks. \nMcCafe is “a very important piece,” Cunningham said. “It gives us the chance to follow what the customer is really looking for.” \nRe-emphasizing coffee is critical at a time when food sales are under pressure. Supermarkets have lowered prices, making it more alluring to eat at home instead of at a restaurant. Gas stations and other channels also increasingly are selling prepared meals, adding to the competition. \nMcDonald’s is aiming to build on the success of its all-day breakfast, which rolled out last year across the United States. It’s also upgrading stores with table service and more touch-screen ordering kiosks. \nThe all-day breakfast push helped fuel a return to growth, but the resurgence has been waning: Domestic comparable sales rose just 1.3 percent last quarter, and McDonald’s is facing declining foot traffic. \nMcDonald’s isn’t alone in struggling to build a more sophisticated coffee menu. After Burger King introduced 10 new Seattle’s Best drinks in 2013, including flavored lattes, the rollout fizzled. The company later merged with Tim Hortons, a Canadian coffee chain, though the two brands remain distinct. \nThe McDonald’s chain, with about 14,000 domestic restaurants, said in October that it would buy all its coffee from sustainable sources by 2020. In another sign of Starbucks envy, McDonald’s sold pumpkin-spice lattes across all of the nation this fall — the first time it’s done so in three years. Your next Nation & World articles",

      "text": "McDonald’s Takes on Starbucks With Elaborate Espresso Machines McCafes are being overhauled with some serious barista tech share Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Aside from their shared status as global behemoths, McDonald’s and Starbucks have few similarities in terms of perception. The former is viewed by many as the picture of low-cost, low-quality fast food, while the latter projects itself as a hip destination for today’s remote workers to plop down in front of their MacBooks for hours at a time. McDonald’s is trying to change those perceptions. Already raising its bar in other areas of service , Mickey D’s is looking to become a more serious player in the modern coffee game, reports Bloomberg . The chain is overhauling its McCafe brand with beans sourced from sustainable purveyors and fancy espresso machines that check in at $12,000 a pop. A company spokesperson tells Bloomberg the reboot will allow McCafe to “better cater to customer needs.” Whether the changes will draw in a new clientele seeking a premium experience remains to be seen, but McDonald’s isn’t turning its back on customers who look to the chain for value. McDonald’s will offer $1 drip coffee in the first quarter of 2017, according to Bloomberg , and it’s planning a $2 “specialty coffee” deal as well. Still, it can’t be denied that McDonald’s is evolving. The chain has made its McCafe announcement less than a month after it revealed plans to roll out table service at its restaurants across America. It is also deploying more touchscreen kiosks that offer a line of “Signature Crafted Recipes.” Diners get to choose their protein (grilled or fried chicken or a burger patty) and a flavor profile for toppings (apple-bacon-dijon, sweet barbecue-bacon, or pico-guacamole). It’s an increasingly popular ordering style at burgeoning fast-casual chains. Thanks in large part to the debut of all-day breakfast last fall, McDonald’s has emerged from a years-long sales slump . The chain is clearly trying to take advantage of its newfound momentum and carve out a secure position in the fast food market going forward. If the latest moves are any indication, company executives believe that may mean a transition from the traditional fast food model to a nouveau fast-casual approach. The timing of the Golden Arches’ McCafe news comes on the heels of Starbucks’ own big announcement: Longtime chief executive officer Howard Schultz is stepping down in April . Schultz will remain with the company in a different role, but McDonald’s is giving incoming CEO Kevin Johnson a new challenge to consider.",

      "text": "Home > Blogs > On the Margin > McDonald's makes another run at Starbucks McDonald's makes another run at Starbucks \nThis post is part of the On the Margin blog. \nMcDonald’s Corp. is making another run at the coffee business. \nThe Oak Brook, Ill.-based giant is planning a big push to improve its McCafé brand , with enhancements to its beverage lineup and a planned beverage promotion in a move first reported by Bloomberg and confirmed by the company. \nAs part of the effort, McDonald’s is also requiring operators to install new $12,000 machines to improve the quality of its McCafé beverages. The new machine, according to Bloomberg, can create a wider variety of drinks. \n“We are recommitting to McCafé in 2017 by reinvigorating excitement around our McCafé beverages,” spokeswoman Becca Hary said in an email statement. \nThe company is improving its beverage lineup and will focus on sustainably sourcing its espresso and coffee beans. It is also planning a rewards program through its mobile app and will train workers to deliver the drinks. \nThe big deal will be a promotion next year, offering $1 coffee and $2 small specialty coffees for a limited time, including lattes and mochas. \nMcDonald’s has been eager to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts for some time — the chain opened coffee shops in Australia in the 1990s and opened one in Chicago in 2001. It started pushing its McCafé line of beverages in the U.S. in 2007, ultimately requiring operators to add espresso machines to sell lattes and mochas. \nYet the chain has struggled to generate positive sales and traffic in recent years, and the beverage line outside of coffee hasn’t generated the strength the company had hoped. \nBeverages remain a strong source of sales and traffic at many chains. Starbucks routinely generates strong same-store sales, and its domestic growth has been so strong it is now the second largest U.S. restaurant chain, after McDonald’s, according to the NRN Top 100 . \nMcDonald’s believes it can offer these drinks because they naturally follow the company’s strong breakfast platform as well as its coffee. \nThe question, of course, is whether McDonald’s customers actually want an expansion of the drink platform. \nConsumers generally consider McDonald’s for its speed, price and convenience and have traditionally shunned the company’s higher-end products, be they espresso drinks or burgers or chicken wings. \nThat said, McDonald’s is aggressively working to change that perception and become, in the words of CEO Steve Easterbrook, a “modern, progressive burger company.” \nIt is testing fresh beef . It removed antibiotics from chicken. And it’s trying out table service and kiosks in many markets . \nJonathan Maze, Nation’s Restaurant News senior financial editor, does not directly own stock or interest in a restaurant company. \nContact Jonathan Maze at",

The live playoffs are upon us as the top 8 hopeful artists compete to come out on top on The Voice. The finals are almost upon us as each team’s artists look to win over the audience for a spot.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the top artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save. Then, America has the opportunity to save their favorite performer by tweeting #VoiceSave along with the artist’s name. The singers with the lowest number of votes are sent home each week. In the end, one is named “The Voice” and receives the grand prize of a recording contract.\nShare with us who you liked during the live playoffs in the comments section.

The account has since been restored and below you can see video of Nikki Bella getting ready backstage at WWE TLC last night: - It will be interesting to see if Paige is brought back to the road as her WWE Wellness Policy suspension ends on Friday of this week. It's unlikely she will be wrestling as she had neck surgery back in October but she may be brought back for Total Divas filming. - As seen below, RAW Tag Team Champion Big E received a strange package from McDonald's today: — ShinigamE (@WWEBigE) December 5, 2016  ",

The finals are almost upon us as each team’s artists look to win over the audience for a spot. Miley Cyrus said that she saw what a We tour would look like. She loved how We used the stage and how she worked it on the runway.\nAlicia Keys said that she was so proud of her and that she knows what she wants.\nThe name Wé is Kenyan for “diligence,” which is something that Wé has had her entire life. Her father helped her get into vocal lessons at the Harlem School of the Arts, which she still attends after school and on weekends. Wé has performed at Lincoln Center, Carnegie Hall and, most recently, at the Apollo Theater. Although Wé has always found her place with music, she struggled to fit in at school. Kids teased her for her high-pitched voice and thick glasses, but she stuck it out and slowly things got better. Now she embraces her differences and is hoping her uniqueness will help her stand out on The Voice.\nIn the final live-performance phase of the competition, the top artists compete each week against each other during a live broadcast. The television audience votes to save their favorite artists. The three artists with the lowest number of votes are eligible for the “Instant Save.” These artists each perform a new song that represents why they should earn the save.
