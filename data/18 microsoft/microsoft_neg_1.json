      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nJust as with the Windows Insider program for Windows 10, Microsoft calls on adventurous customers to test new builds of the Xbox One operating system. The company launched the Xbox Preview Program in February of 2014, and since then, it has incorporated feature requests and provided means for voting on potential feature additions to improve the Xbox One experience for all owners. Now, more than two years later, Microsoft is overhauling the program. \nMicrosoft’s head of the Xbox preview program, Emily Hanson, said on Monday that it’s now called the Xbox Insider Program, which falls in line alongside the Windows Insider Program. The name change reflects the program’s expansion beyond offering just previews to system updates with the ability to offer feedback on preview builds of apps, games, and other “experiences.” \nRelated: Xbox One Holiday Gaming Preview \nWith the new program name comes an update to the Xbox Preview Dashboard. According to Hanson, this was rebuilt “from the ground up” to reflect user feedback. The changes start with a new “Xbox Insider Hub” name, a more personalized approach, and a new user interface inspired by the New Xbox One Experience. The update will also provide the ability for multiple users on a single console to provide feedback. \n“We’re starting to roll these changes out today to a small number of preview members who have provided the most feedback since the inception of the Xbox Preview Program,” Hanson said. “If you have your Xbox One console in Instant-on mode and you have the Xbox Preview Dashboard app installed, then you don’t have to do anything — the app will update automatically overnight.” \nIf you haven’t jumped on the Xbox One preview bandwagon, the renamed program provides an additional benefit: an open door for all Xbox One owners. That’s right: Microsoft will provide the Xbox Insider Hub to all Xbox One gamers “soon” for testing new games, apps, and other console “experiences.” What the general base won’t test are new builds of the Xbox One operating system. \nAs shown in Microsoft’s FAQ here , the Xbox Preview Program was split into two offerings: the Xbox Insider Program and the Xbox One Update Preview. The former provides previews for games, apps, new “experiences,” and system updates. The former program focuses only on previewing system updates for the console. \nBased on that information, current Insiders can test apps, games, experiences, and system updates whereas the upcoming new Insiders can only test apps, games, and experiences when the program launches for the masses. The second program, which appears separately in the Xbox Insider Hub app, seems to focus on gamers who only want to test system builds. \n“Xbox Insiders become eligible for previews based on their interests, previous activities in the program, tenure as an Xbox Insider, Xbox Insider XP, and other factors,” the FAQ states. “If you previously participated in the Xbox Preview Program, you can rejoin the Xbox One Update Preview at any time by selecting it from the Insider content list in the Xbox Insider Hub.” \nWith the introduction of the two programs, Microsoft is providing Xbox One owners several ways they can participate in software testing. When the Xbox Insider Program actually rolls out to all Xbox One owners is unknown for now, but hopefully it will be long before Microsoft serves up the Creators Update for Windows 10 in spring 2017.

      "text": "ZDNet Japan ​Webjet partners with Microsoft for blockchain-based online booking service Webjet and Microsoft have teamed up to build a blockchain proof-of-concept that it said has the potential to create a new industry standard. | Topic: E-Commerce \nTravel booking website Webjet has announced it has developed a blockchain proof-of-concept solution with Microsoft that has the potential to transform the way the entire travel industry handles online payments for hotel bookings, the companies said. \nThe partnership has resulted in the building of smart contracts that Webjet's managing director John Guscic said resolves issues created by data mismatches. Latest Australian news NBN doubles capex spending to AU$4.5b in FY2016 \n\"Every day there are millions of transactions taking place and a single hotel stay could involve five or more transactions in the distribution chain,\" Guscic said in a statement. \n\"This marketplace can be prone to data discrepancies due to the volume of bookings passing through multiple systems. Between 5 and 10 percent of bookings can be impacted or, in other words, up to 10 billion dollars' worth of transactions.\" \nBlockchain technology is the underlying system that facilitates bitcoin trading, but its application extends beyond simply finalising a payment. A blockchain is a shared, distributed ledger that can store the complete transaction history of not just cryptocurrency but other kinds of records. \nTo Gusic, the distributed ledger technology provides Webjet with a solution to data mismatch challenges and has the potential to create a new industry standard that will improve the customer experience and reduce costs, with the companies hoping to inspire others to follow their lead. \n\"Blockchain eliminates transaction errors by having an indisputable record of truth,\" Guscic added. \"As we've tested the technology, we quickly realised it had the potential to improve processes with the rest of our travel partners who face similar complexities. It didn't just benefit the Webjet environment; it could potentially assist every one of our partners in the supply chain to improve their efficiency.\" \nMicrosoft said the proof-of-concept project has proven the ability to create shared, independent, and trustworthy documents that remove the risk of data inaccuracies and streamline the payment processes in a way that has reduced fraud and establishes trust and accountability. \nWebjet is rolling out the blockchain platform in three phases. The first phase involves the proof-of-concept now live, with Webjet's Lots of Hotels and Sunhotels brands trialling the platform. The second will see the same brands trial blockchain's automated features, processing thousands of transactions weekly. Following this, Lots of Hotels and Sunhotels will invite selected external parties to use the platform to demonstrate the benefits it delivers to the industry. \nGuscic said Webjet realised facilitating bookings through blockchain could become an additional business it could enter in the future, and also said the same technology could potentially help solve problems outside the travel industry. \n\"Undoubtedly, the blockchain technology built with Microsoft is an exciting opportunity for us over the next few years,\" he said. \nIn September, Microsoft launched an early version of its Azure Blockchain-as-a-Service middleware . Codenamed Project Bletchley , the fabric is meant to provide some of the missing pieces that business users might need before they start using blockchain applications. \n\"Microsoft is uniquely positioned in this era of massive business and societal transformation,\" Microsoft Azure chief technology officer Mark Russinovich said Tuesday. \n\"We're the company that cares most deeply about computing technologies for both people and the organisations they build. By working with Webjet to use our digital platform, together we have created an innovative blockchain solution in Australia that has the potential to not only transform the travel industry but many other industries as well.\" \nMicrosoft initially launched Azure Blockchain as a Service in November 2015. In June this year, Microsoft made a white paper about Bletchley available. \nOn September 20, Microsoft announced the release of Bletchley v1, a blockchain template -- accessible via the Azure Resource Manager -- aimed at helping customers and partners create private consortium Ethereum networks. Microsoft is claiming the template reduces the estimated three-week process of setting up a globally distributed multi-node consortium Ethereum network down to eight questions and five to eight minutes . \nIt is not just Microsoft getting behind the distributed ledger. Analyst firm Gartner has predicted that in 2017 and beyond, blockchain-based businesses will be worth $10 billion by 2022 and that the technology will revamp how transactions are conducted. \nThe Australian Securities Exchange (ASX) recently said its blockchain initiative is on track for a final decision in the second half of 2017, with the prototype complete and the organisation now moving to building an \"industrial-strength solution\" to use as its equity settlement and clearing platform. \nThe Sydney Stock Exchange (SSX) similarly announced a project that would see it instantly settle trades using blockchain technology with the help of Sydney-based Bit Trade Labs. \nLocal banks and telecommunications carriers have also made their own play with blockchain, with Australia's incumbent telco carrier Telstra announcing in September it was experimenting with a combination of blockchain and biometric security for its Internet of Things (IoT) smart home offerings.

      "text": "4 Min Read Webjet and Microsoft aim to transform hotel bookings with new blockchain solution \nWebjet and Microsoft have today announced the creation of a new blockchain proof-of-concept [PoC] solution that they believe will transform the travel industry. The solution has the potential to change the way online payments are processed and managed for hotel bookings. \nGlobally, hotel room wholesaling is a $100 billion industry, with more than a million transactions taking place every day. A single hotel stay could involve five or more transactions, however the sheer volume of bookings passed through the distribution chain is prone to numerous data discrepancies. \n“Between five and 10 percent of bookings can be impacted, or in other words, up to $10 billion dollars worth of transactions,” said managing director of Webjet, John Guscic. \nWebjet is one of Australia and New Zealand’s largest online travel agencies and is responsible for managing thousands of hotel bookings daily across brands including Lots of Hotels and Sunhotels. \nTogether with Microsoft, Webjet has been exploring blockchain as a way to improve the wholesale hotel environment and better manage online payments. In Australia blockchain technology is slowly entering more industries, branching out from fintech and crypto-currencies. \nIn the last year blockchain has been used in the healthtech, agritech and the entertainment industry, with startup Cyph MD improving healthcare payment processes, Full Profile helping farmers get paid on time and Veredictum looking to prevent independent film piracy. \nBlockchain technology has already been established as the next revolution in transaction recording and according to IT research analyst, Gartner, blockchain-based businesses will be worth US$10 billion by 2022 . \nInitially Webjet were looking to use blockchain PoC to boost efficiencies in its own supply chain, however when it saw the potential it had to change the entire travel industry it decided to work with Microsoft to start building smart contracts. \n“We realised facilitating bookings in the travel industry through blockchain could become an additional business we could enter in the future, and the same technology could also help solve problem outside the travel industry. Undoubtedly, the blockchain technology built with Microsoft is an exciting opportunity for us over the next few years,” said Guscic. \nThe smart contract that is currently being built by Webjet and Microsoft will address four key issues in the areas of data mismatches. The smart contract will look to remove the risk of data inaccuracies, streamline payment processes, boost data security and resolve pain points in the payment process. \nWebjet will be rolling out the blockchain platform in three phases. The first phase will involve the PoC, which is now live and trialling with Lots of Hotels and Sunhotels. The second will see the same two brands trialling automated features to process thousands of transactions weekly and following these trials, the third phase will involve the delivery of the platform to external parties. \nSince 2004, Webjet has fostered a relationship with Microsoft, with both working on growing infinitely scalable technology platforms. \nMicrosoft Azure CEO, Mark Russinovich said, “By working with Webjet to use our digital platform, together we have created an innovative blockchain solution in Australia that has the potential to not only transform the travel industry but many other industries as well.” Image: John Guscic.

      "text": "This was supposed to be the Microsoft Lumia 750 This was supposed to be the Microsoft Lumia 750 Posted: Tags : Windows - Windows + Microsoft - Microsoft + While Microsoft is still selling some Lumia smartphones, it looks like the company is getting ready to slowly phase out the brand . The last Lumia phone announced was the low-end Lumia 650 (in February), which followed the Lumia 950, 950 XL, and 550 (all three unveiled over a year ago, in October 2015). But what happened to the Lumia 750 and Lumia 850 that were also expected to be released last year? Well, both have been cancelled. Even so, if you're curious to know what the Lumia 750 could have been, we can now take a look at it. Evan Blas (aka @evleaks) uncovered a couple of high-res renders that show the cancelled device - codenamed Microsoft Giulin - from front and back. According to previously leaked details , the Lumia 750 had a 5-inch 720p display - just like the Lumia 650. However, as we can see in the images below, the 750 had smaller bezels around its screen, arguably looking better than the Lumia 650. The Lumia 750 was also supposed to be a bit more powerful than the Snapdragon 212-based Lumia 650, thanks to a Snapdragon 410 processor. The phone packed a 2650 mAh battery, further offering 1 GB of RAM, 8 GB of expandable storage space, an 8 MP rear camera, and a 5 MP front-facing camera. We don't know why Microsoft cancelled the release of this particular device, but it may have something to do with the fact that the company wants to make Surface Phones from now on (though it looks like we won't be seeing any of these before the second half of 2017).

      "text": "Start by checking the basics as described in Microsoft's technet article on event 1130: \nMake sure the Remote Desktop server has network connectivity to the licensing server. If you can ping the licensing server, you're probably OK as far as the basics go (but see below). \nMake sure the license server is configured to be automatically discovered. Use the \"Review Configuration\" Action in the Remote Desktop Licensing Manager. \nCheck that the Remote Desktop server can discover the license server. Using the Licensing Diagnosis option in Remote Desktop Session Host configuration, make sure the licensing server appears in the list. \nCheck that the licensing service is running on the license server. The service name is TermServLicensing, the friendly name may be \"Terminal Services Licensing\" or \"Remote Desktop Licensing\" depending on the version of Windows. \nIf you are using Windows Firewall, check that the Remote Desktop Licensing Server exceptions are enabled on the license server. If you are using a third-party firewall, or if there is an external firewall between the Remote Desktop server and the licensing server, make sure all the relevant ports are opened. See this forum thread, and also Which ports are used by a RDS 2012 deployment? on Technet. \nIn my case, however, the problem was with the Local Security Policy on the license server, specifically the \"Access this computer from the network\" option under User Rights Assignment. Although it does not appear to be documented, the Active Directory computer objects representing the Remote Desktop servers must be granted this right, either explicitly or indirectly. (The default setting includes Everyone, which is sufficient to allow Remote Desktop licensing to work.) \nOnce this access right was granted, the next Remote Desktop logon caused the missing X509 Certificate registry entries to be created, and event ID 1130 stopped appearing. \nYou should also check the \"Deny access to this computer from the network\" setting, which takes precedence, and any other configuration changes you might have made to the licensing server which could affect the Remote Desktop server's ability to establish an IPC logon. The security event log on the licensing server may be useful in determining whether the IPC logon is successful or not. \nAdditional notes: \nIf one of your Remote Desktop servers is experiencing this or any similar problem, you can still log into it remotely for troubleshooting purposes using this command line: mstsc /admin /v:servername \nIn case the link in the question goes dead, you can reset the grace period as a temporary workaround by deleting the REG_BINARY value in this key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SYSTEM\\CurrentControlSet\\Control\\Terminal Server\\RCM\\GracePeriod \n(This is of course unsupported and should be used only with due care and at your own risk.) \nIf you have experienced the same problem but due to a cause not covered by my self-answer, please post another answer (preferably) or a comment. Thanks in advance!",

      "title": "System Center Configuration Manager 2007 Affected by New Windows Update Model",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft's new update service model for Windows 7 and Windows 8.1 clients, initiated last month, may cause additional work for IT pros using System Center Configuration Manager 2007 (SCCM 2007). \nSCCM 2007 users face carrying out manual steps to temporarily resolve issues should a monthly cumulative Windows update cause problems. Those limitations were described on Friday in this Microsoft blog post . \nMicrosoft kicked off the new update model for all supported Windows operating systems on Oct. 11. Under this model, Microsoft releases monthly cumulative updates for Windows clients and server operating systems. That change in policy put Windows 7/8.1 users on the same cumulative update treadmill as faced by Windows 10 users. Organizations now get a \"security-only quality update\" and a \"security monthly quality update\" each month on \"patch Tuesday,\" or the second Tuesday of the month, for Windows operating systems. \nIn the past, application compatibility issues that had occurred after Windows updates were installed might be resolved by rescinding a single patch. With the new model, though, that's not possible. The whole cumulative update has to be rescinded. \nOrganizations facing application compatibility issues after a Windows update can opt to install the security-only quality update. That's one strategy to stay patched against security issues until a solution for a problem is found. However, users of SCCM 2007 specifically lack this flexibility. Essentially, the security-only quality update shows up as \"superseded\" for those users because SCCM 2007 lacks patch supersedence customization capabilities. The presence of the security monthly quality update causes the security-only update to be seen as unnecessary, or superseded. \nThe workaround for SCCM 2007 users is to get the security-only update from the Microsoft Update Catalog. Next, they then have to manually install the security-only update using the command-line standalone installer tool (Wusa.exe) . \nUsers of new client management solutions, such as System Center Configuration Manger 2012, do have the ability to customize supersedence rules. Consequently, they can delay the supersedence of Windows updates. Doing so will let them opt to use the security-only update, if wanted, without supersedence taking place,   explained. \nDespite the limitation, SCCM 2007 currently is a supported product, which means that Microsoft continues to send security and nonsecurity patches for it. SCCM 2007 will lose support on July 9, 2019, according to Microsoft's lifecycle support description  ",

      "title": "Microsoft Issues Azure Container Service Engine as Open Source Code",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft today released the source code for its Azure Container Service (ACS) Engine as open source code, and also added support for Kubernetes 1.4 and DC/OS 1.8.4. \nThe ACS Engine is now an open source project hosted on the GitHub repository. The Engine code can be customized, and Microsoft is looking to add contributions to it from the community now that it's open source, according to its announcement . \nACS is a service delivered from Microsoft's Azure datacenters that provides open source tools for managing virtual machine clusters. It's based on Apache Mesos open source technology and was built in collaboration with partners Docker and Mesosphere. The ACS service can be used by developers for dev-test purposes, since containers allow applications to run with their own virtualized OS, permitting applications to run without conflicts. \nMicrosoft first issued a preview of ACS almost a year ago , and began offering the service commercially in April of this year . Today's announcement is yet another example of Azure support for open source container technologies, which originated on the Linux operating system side of things. However, Microsoft did promise back in April that Windows Container support would be coming to ACS at some point. \nMicrosoft also announced today that ACS supports Kubernetes 1.4, although it's still at the preview stage. Kubernetes was developed by Google and is an \"open source platform for automating deployment, scaling, and operations for applications across clusters of hosts,\" according to a Kubernetes \"Getting Started\" document . With the ACS support for Kubernetes 1.4, it's yet another choice for performing container orchestration across Azure virtual machines. ACS now has \"deeper and native support of Kubernetes,\"   indicated. \nACS also now supports DC/OS upgrades to version 1.8.4, Microsoft announced. DC/OS is yet another open source platform for distributed systems. It adds management components for distributed systems that use Apache Mesos technologies. DC/OS version 1.8.4 in particular has \"new virtual networking capabilities along with job-scheduling and Marathon-based container orchestration,\" the announcement explained. \nMicrosoft also announced some forthcoming ACS improvements. The service will be getting a preview of a new \" Azure Container Registry \" on Nov. 14, which Microsoft described as a \"private repository for hosting container images.\" The new registry will be compatible with Docker Registry version 2, enabling common tools support. Users of the Azure Container Registry will be able to store container images in the \"same datacenter as your deployments,\" thereby reducing network latency. The Azure Container Registry also will permit the management of Linux and Windows container images from a single registry, Microsoft promised. \nMicrosoft also will be bringing greater Visual Studio capabilities for deploying multiple container Linux applications using ACS on Nov. 14. Organizations will be able to use \"Visual Studio, Visual Studio Team Services and the open source Visual Studio Code\" to manage those applications in \"dev-to-test-to-prod\" scenarios,   promised. \nACS improvements will get further discussed at the Microsoft Connect(); 2016 event for developers happening this month. Part of the event will be live streamed on Nov. 16  ",

      "text": "Microsoft postpones Windows anti-exploit tool's retirement Extends Enterprise Mitigation Experience Toolkit support until July 2018 Related Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 7, 2016 1:06 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Apple just removed hundreds of fake shopping apps from the App Store See More \nMicrosoft last week announced that it would support the Enterprise Mitigation Experience Toolkit (EMET) through July 2018, a year-and-a-half extension for the anti-exploit utility. \nAt the same time, the Redmond, Wash. company dismissed EMET as a behind-the-times tool, and again urged customers to upgrade to Windows 10, arguing that the new operating system is much more secure than previous editions when supplemented by EMET. \n\"EMET hasn't kept pace,\" wrote Jeffrey Sutherland, a Microsoft principal program manager lead, in a post to a company blog Nov. 3. \"Its effectiveness against modern exploit kits has not been demonstrated, especially in comparison to the many security innovations built into Windows 10.\" \nEMET has served multiple masters since its 2009 debut. \nAlthough it was originally designed for enterprises and advanced Windows users, Microsoft quickly began recommending EMET to other customers when ongoing attacks were discovered, but patches had not yet been issued. ALSO ON NETWORK WORLD: What if Windows went open source tomorrow? \nOutsiders concurred. In 2014, Belgian security researcher Peter Van Eeckhoutte, who had reported a vulnerability in Internet Explorer 8 to Hewlett-Packard's Zero Day Initiative bug bounty program, said, \"It should be clear by now that installing EMET has become an important layer of defense on your Windows endpoints. EMET won't stop every single exploit, but it does increase the cost (for an attacker) to pwn [pawn, or hack] a box. If you're serious about security, install it.\" \nEMET was most valuable to Windows XP users during the last five years of its support lifecycle, and to the more secure -- but inevitably targeted -- Windows 7, which remains the most popular OS on the planet. \nWith Windows XP retired and Windows 7 facing the same in January 2020, Microsoft clearly saw EMET as superfluous: Sutherland highlighted the tool's shortcomings, rather than tout its effectiveness. \"EMET has serious limits as well -- precisely because it is not an integrated part of the operating system,\" Sutherland wrote. \"Not surprisingly, one can find well-publicized, often trivial bypasses, readily available online to circumvent EMET.\" \nThose comments were harsher than anything Microsoft has said about EMET in the past. As recently as October 2015 , for example, Microsoft posted a nine-item list of benefits, leading off with, \"EMET helps protect against new and undiscovered threats even before they are formally addressed through security updates or anti-malware software.\" \nDisparaging their older software -- even when they had previously sung praises of that software -- and trumpeting the newest is a common ploy by developers pushing customers to upgrade. \nMicrosoft will support EMET 5.5x -- the only version now supported -- until July 31, 2018, Sutherland said.

      "text": "Twitter \nIn March, 2016 Microsoft announced the awesome Canonical partnership. Touted as Linux on Windows, the developers rejoiced at the prospect of Bash coming to Windows 10 Surprising Reasons Why You Will Like Windows 10 10 Surprising Reasons Why You Will Like Windows 10 It's almost cool to hate on Windows 10 these days. Don't let that deprive you of all the benefits Windows 10 will bring! We show you what you're missing out on. Read More . Rather than a virtual machine, the Windows 10 Anniversary Update promised to bring the full functionality of bash to Windows. \nBash for Windows has been live for some time, and packs a wallop of capabilities. While certainly catering to a developer audience, more features lurk beneath the command line Windows 10 Receives a Full Linux Command Prompt Windows 10 Receives a Full Linux Command Prompt BASH shell, complete with a Linux sub-system, is coming to Windows 10 with the Anniversary Update this summer. That was one of the biggest announcements at the Build Developer Conference. Here's why this matters. Read More . Learn more about Bash on Windows, from how and why you should install it, to hidden features you probably didn’t know about. System Requirements for Bash on Windows \nGetting Bash on Windows installed is pretty simple, but let’s start with the basics. \nYou’ll need a PC running Windows 10 How to Install Windows 10 for Free on any Windows, Linux, or OS X PC How to Install Windows 10 for Free on any Windows, Linux, or OS X PC You don't have to upgrade to Windows 10 to try it. Whether you qualify for the free upgrade or want to try Windows 10 on Linux or OS X, you can evaluate it for free. Read More , a 64-bit PC, and the Windows 10 Anniversary Update installed. Since the update targeted developers, you’ll also need to toggle developer mode on. Rebooting may be required. Once it’s back on, Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta) may be enabled under Windows Features. This then prompts another reboot, and finally once your system has turned back on, you can open Bash. Woohoo! \nSo installing and running Bash on Windows is surprisingly easy. As long as you’re armed with a 64-bit Windows 10 PC and have the Anniversary Update installed, it’s as simple as switching on a few features. Enabling Bash on Windows \nEnabling Bash on Windows isn’t as difficult as it sounds. Here’s how to go about with install. \nFirst, enable Developer Mode. Navigate to Settings > Update & Security > For Developers and select the bubble by Developer Mode . \nNext, hit Windows keys + Q and search for Turn Windows Features on or off . \nCheck OK and reboot. Once up and running again, open the Start Menu and search for Bash . Click on the Bash run command option. \nYou’ll be promoted to accept the terms of service, and after agreeing to those, Bash will download. \nOnce this is finished, you can finally run Bash! To do this, simply open the Start Menu and search for Ubuntu . What You Can Actually Do \nOne of the biggest questions, what can you actually do with Bash on Windows? Standard GNU command line tools including… grep ssh nano \n…should work perfectly. Installing packages and updates using apt and apt-get functions great as well. Symlink and file system support comes via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) environment, and there’s some programming language support for the likes of Python, NodeJS, and Perl. While Bash on Windows is not intended for running graphical apps, it can be accomplished. \nLuckily, you can’t edit/open/delete Windows apps or alter Windows system settings. This is a great failsafe, as we all know mistakes can happen when using the command line. Installing Linux Software \nOn Linux, you can install apps via several methods. The command line is most commonly used. The apt-get downloads software packages from repositories, along with dependencies. It’s nifty, and would look like this (sans-brackets, and with the actual package name): sudo apt-get install [packagename] \nIf we’re installing Git for instance, we’ll run: sudo apt-get install git \nPretty simple. However, make sure to include sudo as we need superuser permissions. Git, and other software may be installed from source as well. Born to Run (Graphical Apps) \nBash on Windows does not support graphical Linux apps, or at least officially. However, community members found a method of doing so using the apparently rather versatile Windows Subsystem for Linux. Just because something isn’t made for one purpose doesn’t mean it can’t be used for that. \nCase in point: installing Bash for Windows installs an entire Ubuntu user space image. Basically, you get everything (all the binaries) that is featured on a traditional Ubuntu install with a graphical user interface (GUI). \nBy including a complete Ubuntu user space, it’s therefore possible to run graphical Linux apps on Windows. The workaround calls for installing X Server, using apt-get to install a program, setting a display environment variable, and finally launching the application. Though not particularly difficult, it is a cumbersome process as display environment variables must be set each time you want to run a graphical app. \nFurthermore, it’s an unsupported feature, so functionality is contingent on a bevy of factors. As any native Linux user knows, app installs often require dependencies and tweaks as is, so you can only imagine jerry-rigging Bash on Windows to run these. \nWant to run Linux graphical applications? You’re probably better off using Cygwin Forget Cygwin: CASH Brings The Best Of Linux To Windows Forget Cygwin: CASH Brings The Best Of Linux To Windows Linux and Windows are very different operating systems, and nowhere is that more apparent than with the command line. Various tools are available to make Windows feel more like Linux, such as Cash. Read More , a VM on Windows to run a Linux distribution or just dual booting. Then again, there is the novelty of graphical Linux apps on Windows. Accessing Files \nInstalling Bash for Windows creates a full Ubuntu user space. You can easily access these files using the Windows File Explorer. However, you will have to know where to look, which requires first enabling Show hidden files, folders, and drives under File Explorer view options. Each Windows user account has its own Ubuntu user space, which can be found by navigating to the folder: \nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Lxss\\rootfs \nThe account home folder resides at: \nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Lxss\\home\\USERNAME \nWith the root folder of: \nC:\\Users\\USERNAME\\AppData\\Local\\Lxss\\root \nAccessing Windows system files in Bash is a bit different. The default in Bash is the Ubuntu root directory created within the Windows file system. But you may mount the Windows system drive. So to mount the C: drive, use the command: /mnt/C \nFor the D: drive this would be: /mnt/D \nAnd so on. Since we’re using the command line, we can couple such commands with the likes of cd (change directory). Permissions work a bit differently. To access the admin folder, the Bash on Windows program requires the “Run as Administrator” privilege. Server Management \nWant a super practical reason to use Bash for Windows? Server management is a great idea. Creating a server is really easy, but if it’s headless, you’ll need a way to manage it. There are loads of apps including PuTTY, but the command line offers a simple solution. Just ssh into the server and you can manage it from the terminal. Running remote scripts works quite well using Bash on Windows, and it’s a fantastic useful application. Uninstall Bash for Windows \nOnce you’ve installed Bash for Windows, it’s fairly easy to uninstall. There are two main methods for accomplishing this: one removes Ubuntu environment but keeps your home folder intact. To accomplish this, run these commands via the command prompt or PowerShell: lxrun /uninstall \nA notification will then warn of the results of uninstalling: “This will remove the Ubuntu environment as well as any modifications and new applications…” \nType y to proceed with removal. \nThe alternative turns off the Windows Subsystem for Linux and this removes the Ubuntu environment and the home folder: lxrun /uninstall /full \nA notification warns: \n“This will uninstall Ubuntu on Windows. This will remove the Ubuntu environment as well as any modifications, new applications, and user data.” \nType y to allow the removal of the software. \nBash on Windows packs loads of potential, and there are superb resources from the likes of the Windows blog, Ubuntu community sites, and even everyone’s favorite: Reddit . Conversations in the /r/bashonubuntuonwindows thread include running Visual Studio code, Samba file servers, and developing with WSL. As running graphical apps proved, the possibilities are almost infinite. \nWhat are you currently using Bash on Windows for? Are you even running Bash on Windows?

      "text": "How to Add Images and a Site Logo to Your Website with Microsoft Expression Web Chapter 2: Insert Photos and Other Pictures to Your Web Page How to Add Images and a Site Logo to Your Website with Microsoft Expression Web by Christopher Heng, thesitewizard.com \nMost websites have one or more pictures on their pages. Such images usually include their site logo, photos of their products, design elements, and perhaps even a picture of their webmaster. This chapter shows you how you can add such images to your site. \nPlease note that this is the second chapter of the Microsoft Expression Web Tutorial series. I shall assume that you already have done the things mentioned in chapter 1 and are familiar with the concepts introduced there. If this is the first time you are designing a website, I recommend that you start from the beginning, with my article on the steps to creating a website . Goal of This Chapter \nBy the end of this chapter, you will have placed an image containing your website logo onto your web page, along with any other pictures that you may want there. You will also have learnt (\"learned\" in US English ) how to centre (\"center\") a picture horizontally on a page, make text wrap around it, as well as to put space between the image and the surrounding words. How to Get the Images For Your Site \nYou will need the following pictures for this tutorial. Site Logo \nYour website logo is just a picture of some sort that uniquely brands your website. For example, thesitewizard.com's logo can be found at the top left corner of every page of this site, including this one that you are reading. \nIf your site is for a business, and you already have a company logo, you should of course use that same image. Get a digital copy of that logo, or if you don't have one, scan it (eg, from your company's letterhead) into your computer. \nOtherwise, you will have to create one. Your logo does not have to be a masterpiece of artistic talent, but it should be unique, so you will probably not want to get it from a clip art or royalty-free photo collection . If you are at a complete loss as to what to do, read How to Create a Logo for Your Site the Quick and Easy Way for some tips. \nIn all cases, whether you design one from scratch or use an existing logo, make sure that your image is in the PNG, JPEG (JPG) or GIF graphic file format. Don't use any other format, or your logo may not be displayed correctly in many web browsers. If you have a picture in a different format (eg, a TIFF file or something), convert it with a picture editor. There are many free image editors around, most (if not all) of which can convert pictures from one format to the other. (Usually, all that's needed is to open the picture in that software, and save the same file in a different format.) Product Photo and Other Pictures \nOther pictures that you may want to display include your product photos (for those intending to sell stuff), holiday snapshots (eg, if yours is a personal site, and you want to inflict your holiday photos on others) and even decorative pictures. \nLike all things you put on the Internet, be circumspect about revealing personal details (eg photos of yourself, friends and family, photos of your place of residence, work or school, photos of places you frequent or the routes you take daily, etc). Make sure you know what you are doing before posting such things; they cannot be undone in any effective way — once something is online, someone will probably have a copy of it even if you delete your entire website. Copy the Pictures Into a Folder on Your Website \nEven if your pictures are already placed in some directory (or \"folder\" in layman's language) on your computer, you will need to copy them into the directories monitored and managed by Expression Web. \nOpen the folder where you currently store your images. For example if they are currently located in your \"Pictures\" directory, open that folder. That is, by the end of this step, you should have a window open showing you the picture files that you want to use for your website. Leave this window open for now, and go on to the next step. \nStart up Expression Web, if you have closed it since the previous chapter. \nIf Expression Web shows you the home page that you were working on in chapter 1, close it by clicking \"File | Close\". If you remember, this means to click \"File\" from the menu bar followed by \"Close\" in the drop-down menu that appears. \nMove your mouse pointer so that it is hovering somewhere in the main section of the Expression Web window (in the Site View tab), where your \"index.html\" and \"styles.css\" files should be listed. Don't point it at any of the files, but at a blank spot (say) underneath those files. \nNow click your right mouse button. A menu should appear. Click \"New | Folder...\" on that pop-up menu. \nA new folder will appear in the section where \"index.html\" and \"styles.css\" are listed. Its default name of \"New_Folder\" will be selected with an edit box around it indicating that you can change its name. Rename it \"images\" (without the quotation marks). Notice that I said \"images\" and not \"Images\" or \"image\" or any other combination of letters. \nIf you had accidentally clicked elsewhere before changing the folder name, resulting in the edit box disappearing, you can get it back again by clicking the filename, then pressing the \"F2\" key on your keyboard. \nNow right click the \"images\" folder. That is, move your mouse pointer so that it is over the word \"images\" in the file listing, and click the right mouse button. \nIn the menu that appears, click \"Open Folder in Windows Explorer\". A folder window will open. \nThe window will show a number of files, including \"index.html\", \"styles.css\" and \"images\". Depending on your windows settings, you may not see the file extensions (the \".html\" and \".css\" parts of the filename) and you may or may not also see \"_vti_cnf\", \"_vti_pvf\" and \"desktop.ini\". \nDoubleclick the \"images\" folder. That is, click the \"images\" folder twice in quick succession. You should now see the contents of the \"images\" folder, which is, for now, empty. \nSwitch back to the window that you opened in step 1 and select (ie, highlight) all the files that you want to use on your site. Right click the selection and click the \"Copy\" item in the menu that pops up. \nSwitch to the currently empty \"images\" folder. Right click the blank space in the middle of the window and click \"Paste\" from the menu that appears. Windows will then copy the pictures into the images directory. \nClose both this \"images\" folder window and the window you opened in step 1. You won't need them any more. How to Insert Your Site Logo \nAs mentioned in chapter 1, we will be inserting your site logo into the header section (or masthead) of your home page. \nDoubleclick the \"index.html\" file in the Expression Web's Site View pane to open it. \nClick to put your text cursor in the header section, somewhere among the words \"Placeholder content for your header section [etc]\" and delete those words. \nLeave your text cursor in the now empty section. \nClick \"Insert | Picture | From File...\" from the main menu. \nA dialog box with the title \"Picture\" will appear. Doubleclick the \"images\" folder. \nYou should see the pictures that you copied here earlier. Click the picture that you want to use as your logo. Its filename should appear in the \"File name\" field. Click the \"Insert\" button near the bottom of the dialog box. \nA dialog box with the title \"Accessibility Properties\" will appear. \nType \"Example Co's logo\" (without the quotes) into the \"Alternate text\" field. You should of course replace the words \"Example Co\" with either the name of your website or its domain name . The contents of this field will be displayed in non-graphical web browsers, such as the screen reader software used by the blind. It is also used by search engines to understand what the picture shows, since search engines can't actually \"see\" your picture and appreciate its art. \nLeave the \"Long description\" box empty, and click the \"OK\" button. \nYour logo will now appear on your web page, flushed to the left. (You may not be able to see that it is aligned with the left edge of the page if your logo is as wide as, or wider than, the Expression Web's main section.) \nBe patient. We'll fix that in a bit, within this chapter itself. First, we have to deal with a common problem faced by newcomers at this stage. How to Delete the Picture \nNow that your logo is inserted into the page, if you are new to web design, you may find that it doesn't look as good as you thought it would. For example, you may not like its colours, or you may find that it is too wide or too tall, or some other thing. Relax. This is normal. Since you're new to web design, you don't have sufficient prior experience to guide you in the creation of a logo, resulting in such teething problems. \nThe easiest way to solve this is to delete the picture, go back to your picture editor and fix the problem (whatever it may be), copy the newly revised picture into your \"images\" folder (yes, don't forget to do this, or you'll still see your old picture), and redo the picture insertion process again. \nTo delete the logo (and in fact, any image that you have inserted onto your page), click it once to select it. Then hit the \"Delete\" key on your keyboard. The picture will immediately be removed. If you're afraid that you won't be able to locate the header section again later (because now it neither has a picture nor the original placeholder words), just type some words there, eg, \"picture comes here\". You will of course have to delete those words later before reinserting your revised picture. How to Centre the Website Logo \nBefore we go into the technical details of centring (\"centering\") the logo, we need to talk a bit about how your web page appears in a browser. \nWhen you tested your home page in a browser at the end of chapter 1, you may have notice that it does not look 100% the same as in Expression Web. In fact, the page looks different depending on how wide or narrow you resize the browser. For example, a sentence on your page may only occupy a single line in a big window, but be folded so that it takes up several lines in a narrower one. \nThis is, of course, expected, and perfectly logical, given that the text size remains the same no matter how wide or narrow the window is. But this malleable nature of a web page also affects how your logo appears on it. \nIn a narrow window, your logo may appear perfectly placed, spanning its entire width. Widen that window and what was once properly positioned will now appear to dangle on left side, with the right side an empty expanse. \nIn view of this, I recommend that you follow the instructions given below, even if your logo seems to be perfectly balanced on your page in Expression Web. The only time you should skip the steps below is if you really want your logo to be flushed to the left of your page. \nClick the picture once (to select it). \nLook at the bottommost panel on the left side of the Expression Web window. The panel has two tabs at the top, \"Tag Properties\" and \"CSS Properties\". Make sure the \"Tag Properties\" tab is selected (otherwise click it once). The panel should look similar to my picture below, although it won't be exactly the same since my logo has different properties. (For example, your logo will probably not be called \"Example Co's logo\".) \nLook at the word \"style\" in that panel. Notice that the field next to it ends with \"...\". Click that line (eg click the word \"style\" if you don't know where to click). This puts the focus on the line and transforms the \"...\" into a clickable button (although it won't look like one). Click the \"...\". \nThis time, a dialog box with the title \"Modify Style\" will appear. By default, the first line in the left column, \"Font\", will be selected. Click the \"Box\" line in that column to select it instead. \nLook for \"margin\" section, and uncheck the box \"Same for all\" in that section by clicking it. See the picture below to make sure you get the correct field. \nClick the down arrow for the field labelled \"right\" in the \"margin\" section and select \"auto\" in the drop down box that appears. \nDo the same for the field labelled \"left\". \nBy the end of this step, the dialog box should look like the picture below. \nIf you find that the \"right\" and \"left\" fields are disabled, and cannot be selected, it means that you did not uncheck the \"Same for all\" box as mentioned earlier. \nNow click the \"Layout\" line in the left column. (It's just underneath \"Position\" which is under the \"Box\" line you clicked earlier.) \nThe contents of the right side of the dialog box will change accordingly. Look for the line that says \"display\" and click the drop-down arrow for that field. Select \"block\" from the list that appears. \nClick the \"OK\" button. Your logo should now be centred along the horizontal axis of the page. How to Insert Normal Pictures into Your Web Page \nNow that you have finished adding your logo, it's time to insert the other pictures. The procedure is the same, except that you have other decisions that you need to make. \nThere are at least two ways you can put your images onto your page. One is to place them apart from the existing paragraphs. This is the way I have placed the illustrations in this article. (Scroll up to see this.) Each picture stands alone in its own paragraph (loosely speaking). The words in the paragraph above it stop cleanly before the image starts, and the words following form a new paragraph underneath. \nTo insert a picture this way, do the following: \nPosition your text cursor after the last letter of the paragraph before the picture and hit the ENTER key to make a new paragraph. This is where the picture will be inserted. \nClick \"Insert | Picture | From File...\" as before, select your picture, and hit the \"OK\" button. \nEnter a brief sentence (or even just a phrase) describing the picture. For example, if your picture shows one of the products you are selling, type its name (eg, \"Widget A\", without the quotes) into the \"Alternate text\" field. Then click the \"OK\" button. \nThe picture should now appear on the page in its own \"paragraph\". \nOn the other hand, if you prefer to have your picture surrounded by text, with the words flowing either on the left of the picture or on the right, do the following. \nPut your text cursor at start of the paragraph where you want the picture to appear. Do this even if you want it to appear on the right instead of the left. \nInsert your picture the usual way at this spot, with \"Insert | Picture | From File...\". As usual, add the appropriate alternate text when prompted. (If this sounds too vague to you, scroll up this page to see the detailed instructions. It's the same procedure.) \nThe picture will now appear in an awkward position at the place you inserted it. \nDon't worry. We will fix this in the next step. \nClick the picture once to select it. \nLook at the \"Tag Properties\" panel at the bottom left column of Expression Web. Yes, this is the same panel we used earlier for your logo. Again, click the \"style\" line to put the focus there, and click the \"...\" on that line. \nThe familiar \"Modify Style\" dialog box should appear for your picture. Click \"Layout\" in the left column. \nClick the drop down box for \"float\" in the right column. If you want your picture on the left of the text, click \"left\". If you want it on the right, click \"right\". (My picture below shows the \"float\" field with \"left\" selected, but you should choose \"right\" if that's what you want.) \nIf you have enough words in the paragraph, they should now flow to the right or left of your picture with any additional text underneath. However, notice that the words are probably far too close to the picture for it to look good. To fix this, bring up the \"Modify Style\" dialog box again. (See above if you've forgotten how to do this.) \nClick the \"Box\" line in the left column. \nUncheck the \"Same for all\" box for the \"padding\" section. Notice I that said the \"padding\" section this time, and not the \"margin\". \nWhat your picture needs is a bit of padding (blank space) between the picture and the words. If the words are on the right of your picture, you need a bit of padding on the right. Otherwise, if the words are on the left, the padding needs to be on the left. \nClick to put your text cursor into either the \"right\" or \"left\" field accordingly. (Reread the paragraph above, if you don't know which field.) Then enter \"10\" (without the quotation marks). The field next to it should now show \"px\". If it doesn't, click the down arrow and select \"px\" (which means \"pixels\"). You are putting 10 pixels worth of space between your picture and the words next to it. \nClick the \"OK\" button to dismiss the dialog box. \nThe words should now shift slightly away from your picture. To see it properly, you need to click to put the text cursor somewhere on the page (it doesn't matter where) so that the outline around your picture (which is there because you selected it earlier) does not obscure the actual distance. \nIf your words are now too far away (or still too close) to the picture for your liking, go back to the \"Modify Style\" dialog box and put a different number into the appropriate field. For example, if it is now too far away, change the \"10\" to (say) \"5\" and view the result. You can keep repeating these steps with some other number till you get the appearance you want. \nNote that if you find the vertical space between the bottom of the picture and the words underneath to be too narrow, you can also adjust the \"bottom\" field for the \"padding\" section as well. Saving Your Work \nOnce you have added all the pictures you want, save your changes with \"File | Save\". Testing in a Browser \nOpen your page in a browser as you did in chapter 1, that is, with \"File | Preview in Browser\". \nAs in chapter 1, you will probably find that your page looks slightly different here, since the browser window is likely to be far wider than the centre pane of Expression Web. And it also doesn't show all those guiding lines that the editor displays to help you edit your page more intelligently. If you don't like the result you see, go back to Expression Web and make adjustments to the page. \nYou should probably also resize your browser window to mobile phone sizes the way you did before . Notice that your pictures shrink automatically to fit the window size without the surrounding text also shrinking along with it. This is the result of the responsive web design code produced by the Layout Wizard ; the code adjusts your page according to the size of the browser window. Next Chapter \nIn the next chapter, you will find out how to change font sizes, put text in bold and italics, and even switch fonts. I am in the process of writing the next chapter at the moment.

That's fine, I play a ton of old games too. I have been binging on Diablo II (using glide ironically, hah) lately, but I also like to play the latest games when I want to with the most efficient way and API to play them. Would you call Windows Vista obsolete for modern gaming? I would, because most new releases use DirectX 11 or above now. Sure, there's no real reason why DirectX 12 wouldn't in theory work on Win 7 and below if Microsoft updated it them to, but they have no vested interest in keeping you on old software. They're a business, of course they would want you to use their latest product. 7 is not as bad as Vista in terms of obsolescence, but it's heading that way. I think if you were still using Windows 7 in 2027, you could justifiable be called a Luddite.",

      "text": "Trimble's New SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens Enables Users to Inhabit and Experience Designs [November 07, 2016] Tweet \nLAS VEGAS , Nov. 7, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Trimble (NASDAQ:TRMB) launched today its SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens . The new mixed-reality solution allows users to virtually inhabit and experience their designs to improve quality, communication and efficiency in the design, construction and operation of buildings. SketchUp Viewer is the first extensible commercial HoloLens application available in the Windows Store. \nThe announcement was made at Trimble Dimensions . \nSketchUp is the world's most widely used 3D modeling software for architects, engineers, design and construction professionals as well as members of the global maker community. \nDemonstration Highlights Design and Collaboration Scenarios \nDuring the Trimble Dimensions keynote, Trimble, Microsoft and architect Greg Lynn demonstrated how the SketchUp Viewer solution could improve design and construction processes. Using HoloLens, architects were able to experience SketchUp models in mixed reality, as holograms placed in the real world—enabling them to quickly analyze various \"what if\" design scenarios in the context of the physical environment. The demonstration also illustrated how using Trimble solutions with HoloLens holographic technology enables remote teams to effectively review and collaborate in order to resolve constructability issues in real time. \nGreg Lynn leveraged Trimble's mixed-reality solution and Microsoft HoloLens to re-imagine the Packard Plant—a historic, abandoned automobile factory in Detroit . The architectural project was commissioned as part of the U.S. Pavilion at the 2016 Venice Biennale exhibition in Italy . \n\"Trimble mixed-reality technology and Microsoft HoloLens bring the design to life and bridge the gap between the digital and physical. Using this technology I can make decisions at the moment of inception, shorten the design cycle and improve communication with my clients,\" said Greg Lynn . \nThe emergence of mixed-reality technology is enabling new workflow processes for the Architecture, Engineering, Construction and Operations (AECO) market. Trimble's mixed-reality solution gives users the ability to understand and communicate complex spatial conditions in one comprehensive and immersive experience. The combination of SketchUp with mixed reality ushers in a new paradigm: Experiential Design Review—the ability to inhabit and experience design and construction projects in the most natural way possible. \n\"Empowering people to design and communicate better in 3D is part of our DNA. Across the SketchUp platform, we are dedicated to the idea that technology should get out of the way of our users,\" said Chris Keating , general manager of Trimble's SketchUp. \"With SketchUp Viewer, we are taking another big step toward delivering the ultimate experience for designers and theirclients—the experience of inhabiting their own work.\" \nTrimble's SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens \nMicrosoft HoloLens is the world's first self-contained, holographic computer that provides a mixed-reality experience for a range of commercial and consumer applications. HoloLens extends interaction with 3D models beyond the confines of a 2D computer screen, creating new ways for the many stakeholders of complex, multi-phase construction projects to visualize, collaborate, share ideas and manage change. \n\"We are thrilled to work with Trimble to deliver new innovation to SketchUp, one of the most widely used applications in the architecture, engineering, construction and operations industry,\" said Lorraine Bardeen , general manager of Microsoft HoloLens and Windows Experiences. \"SketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens can dramatically improve collaboration, decision making, efficiency, quality, and safety by giving users the unique ability to bring digital content into the real world, real-time as part of their current workflow.\" \nWith SketchUp Viewer, users can view models that have been published to their HoloLens device via the newly launched AR|VR Extension for SketchUp Desktop; they can browse and download models from Trimble's 3D Warehouse or they can pull project files down from Trimble Connect , a cloud-based collaboration platform. Users then have the option to place a model within their physical environment. \nIn Tabletop mode, models can be scaled as needed to best fit the available space or specific design review requirements. While the experience is intended to mimic viewing a physical scale model, it maintains the flexibility and the dynamic nature of a digital model. Users can re-scale, move and rotate the model as desired. Models can be anchored and re-anchored in the physical environment, so designers and engineers can walk around the project and examine it from any vantage point. \nWhat truly differentiates SketchUp Viewer from any other product on the market is the ability for users to transition seamlessly to an immersive experience. Mixed reality enables unique opportunities to overlay physical models in real world environments; and as a completely untethered device, HoloLens allows users to move freely as they inhabit their digital surrounds. \nIn both Tabletop and Immersive mode, SketchUp Viewer allows users to do more than just look at the model. The application provides access to the most critical pieces of information for making vital project decisions and gaining consensus among project stakeholders. The Entity Info feature gives users access to important Building Information Modeling (BIM) data embedded within project components; and with the Tape Measure functionality, users can pull up dimensional information from the model. Users can also control the visibility of various aspects of the model by toggling layers on and off. \nReal-time, remote and co-located collaboration are key elements to the experiential design review process in SketchUp Viewer. With multiple HoloLens devices, a group of users can load the same model, engaging a \"see what I see\" collaboration mode. Remote collaborators can communicate via real-time audio and use mixed-reality visualization \"sight-guides\" to better understand who in the group is looking at what. \nAvailability \nSketchUp Viewer for Microsoft HoloLens is available now from the Microsoft Windows Store. For more information, visit: www.sketchup.com/viewer . A new AR|VR extension for SketchUp Desktop, which enables users to publish models directly from their desktop to the Microsoft HoloLens, is available from SketchUp's Extension Warehouse. Microsoft HoloLens devices are available for purchase from the Microsoft Store: www.microsoft.com/microsoft-hololens . \nAbout Trimble Buildings \nSketchUp is a core product of Trimble Buildings, a part of Trimble's Engineering and Construction segment focused on solutions to optimize the complete Design-Build-Operate (DBO) lifecycle of buildings.

      "text": "However, thanks to a deep dive by the folks over at Windows Central , more details about Microsoft’s next console offering have surfaced. \nAccording to the head of Xbox Phil Spencer, “is designed to power 4K games and “high-fidelity VR.” On top of powering 4K games Windows Central also reports that development for Project Scorpio will remain relatively streamlined. \nWith minimal changes, developers have been able to create apps for Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile that work across all sorts of devices, including phones, laptops, tablets, Xbox One consoles and even the holographic HoloLens. \nOur source told us that any game programmed natively for UWP on Windows 10 will run on Project Scorpio with a trivial amount of changes. This has always been Microsoft’s vision for UWP.” \nWith that being said, some gamers have already begun getting a taste of Projet Scorpio’s prowess over the past few months with releases such as Gears of War 4, Forza Horizon 3 and Rise of the Tomb Raider. When gamers play those selected games at 4K resolution on a high-end PC, the experience is analogous to how a UWP developed Project Scorpio game will eventually run. Xbox Play Anywhere \nWhen a game is being run by a customer, it will detect the hardware making the runtime request and unpack the correct assets dynamically. Since UWP games on PC already support most Xbox features, including controllers, there will be a minimal amount of work involved when bringing PC UWP games to the Xbox consoles. Our source told us that games such as Gears of War 4, ReCore, Rise of the Tomb Raider and Forza Horizon 3 are already using this system on Xbox One and Windows 10 PCs today. There’s also a fair chance the new Call of Duty on the Windows 10 Store is also using this system to prepare for Scorpio, but without seeing the app’s manifest, there’s no way to know for sure.” \nOther questions addressed by the Xbox group involve whether or not the Windows 10 Store will compete with Steam as far as being a gaming hub and paraphrasing Xbox team member Mike Ybarra, the answer is no. Windows 10 Store \nLastly, for any early adopter who may feel jilted by the seemingly sudden upgrade timing this console generation, rest assured Project Scorpio is more than just hardware. According to Windows Central “Finally, Project Scorpio will run on the Xbox One OS, with additional features that support VR and 4K gaming. Whether it will retain the same visual interface is unknown, but considering Project Scorpio is designed to sit alongside the Xbox One, rather than supersede it, it makes sense.” \nProject Scorpio was first unveiled during E3 2016 as Microsoft’s next version of its flagship Xbox gaming console but almost as a side note to the company’s announcement of its revised and slimmed-down version of the Xbox One. \nNot it seems that Project Scorpio will be more than just a hardware evolution from a previous game console and more of software feat that binds all of Microsoft’s future initiatives.

      "title": "Windows 10 rumored to have a fourth Redstone update in the works",
      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nMicrosoft seems to be continuing the tradition of relating their big releases to the codename Redstone even up to the fourth nearly a year and a half away. \nEarlier this year, we saw the Windows 10 Anniversary Update release across all devices. Originally, it had been called Redstone. Since then, we have been eagerly digging for more information about the next rumored Redstone 2 update. Now that we’ve seen what’s coming in what has officially been titled the Creators Update , enthusiasts have turned their sights forward to wonder what’s next. \nWindows Central writer Zac Bowden wrote that the tech giant wouldn’t stop the tradition at Redstone 3 , but hasRedstone 4 already in the works and slotted for early 2018. This follows the trend that Microsoft has put forward with only two large updates per year to satisfy the needs of their growing consumer base while smaller updates maintain and improve minute tasks. \nWe can’t say for certain of the accuracy of the continued Redstone codename, but it wouldn’t be surprising. After all, why fix something that isn’t broken? In this story stream:",

      "text": "Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin it \n(Microsoft) A potential replacement for the Microsoft Lumia 950 (shown), the rumored Microsoft Surface Phone, may be released next year \nMicrosoft's rumored Surface Phone has been in the headlines a bit more recently, but it's not because the device itself has shown up. \nRecently, noted tipster Evan Blass tweeted some pictures showing some kind of new smartphone. \nThe internet quickly came to life and rumblings that the Surface Phone had finally made an appearance began to make the rounds online. \nNotably, Blass did not indicate that the device shown was the highly sought-after Microsoft device even though many people thought it was. Now, as it turns out, the smartphone previewed in the pictures was indeed something else. Advertisement \nA later report from Thurrott shed more light on the matter, revealing that the phone showcased in the images was a Dell-made device. \nAfter a whirlwind weekend, the end result is that there is still no early look at the Surface Phone available at this moment. \nIt's not the end result people who have been seeking this particular smartphone will likely want to hear about, but that's been the case all year when it comes to this Microsoft device. \nPrevious rumors have had the smartphone launching at various points throughout this year, and yet, it's already November and there's still no indication that it will be coming out soon. \nIf anything, signs are hinting that next year may be the time to start the search anew for this smartphone. \nAs an earlier report from ZD Net noted, \"when anything like a Surface Phone ends up materializing, it will likely be late 2017 or maybe even not until 2018.\" \nAt this point, it's simply too hard to tell exactly what Microsoft has planned in terms of their smartphone offerings. \nUnsatisfying as it may be, the only option available to those looking for the Surface Phone right now is to simply prepare for an extended wait as the device they are after is likely not showing up anytime soon.

      "text": "0 A Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop rests on a tabletop at an event in the Manhattan borough of New York City, U.S., October 26, 2016. Reuters/Lucas Jackson \nWhile Apple fans eagerly wait to get their hands on the upcoming Apple MacBook Pro 2016, there’s another laptop in the market that is generating a lot of buzz. The Microsoft Surface Book i7 has all the innovative features that users would love to see in the laptop for which they are ready to empty their pockets. \nThe Surface Book i7 has a metallic chassis and a detachable keyboard. It is considered the heaviest of Microsoft devices weighing around 1,647g. In fact, the Microsoft Surface Book i7 has more or less kept the old design. The screen can be separated from the body and used as a tablet. \nIn terms of power, the base model of the Surface Book i7 has the latest Intel Core i7 processor and 8GB RAM. The premium versions have a dedicated Nvidia GeForce GTX 965M GPU. This means the laptop has the capability to handle a multitude of tasks, provided it’s kept in one piece, reports Trusted Reviews . \nAs per Microsoft , the new 256GB/8GB/Intel Core i7 version of the Surface Book i7 is available for US$2,399 (AU$3,120). The new 512GB/16GB/Core i7 version costs US$2,799 (AU$3,636) and the new 1TB/16GB/Core i7 version is priced at US$3,299 (AU$4,285). \nIn comparison to the Surface Book i7, the Apple MacBook Pro 2016 is thinner and lighter in build. The all-metal body adds to the stylish look. Performance-wise, the MacBook Pro shold be faster as it uses a Skylake processor, better RAM and 2TB of storage. The 15-inch MacBook Pro version also has the AMD Radeon Pro graphics card. \nThe 13-inch MacBook Pro model uses the Intel Iris Graphics. However, battery-wise the Surface Book i7 provides 12-16 hours of battery life compared to MacBook Pro’s 10 hours. \nAs per Apple , the 13-inch basic model comes at a price of US$1,499 (AU$1,950), the Touch Bar and Touch ID included 256GB model comes at US$1,799 (AU$2,340) and the same 512GB model comes at US$1,999 (AU$2,600). The 15-inch 256GB model is available for US$2,399 (AU$3,120) whereas the 512GB model comes at a price of US$2,799 (AU$3,636). \nWhile Apple is constantly improving its MacBook Pro versions, the Microsoft Surface Book i7 laptop provides a better package deal for now. Moreover, its detachable screen is an added bonus.",

      "text": "By Tiernan Ray Microsoft ( MSFT ) bull Karl Keirstead with Deutsche Bank today writes that estimates for the company’s profitability are poised to go higher “after years of being flat/down,” which makes a path to $70 per share not reliant on “multiple expansion” of its valuation.\nMicrosoft shares are today up $1.62, or almost 3%, at $60.33.\nKeirstead, who has a Buy rating on Microsoft, and a $70 price target, writes that the recent fiscal Q1 results have made clear the “most of the margin pressure from the huge cloud investment phase may be behind us.”\nThe bull case that MSFT is closer to (or at) a margin/EPS “inflection point” is being fueled by several positive data points, including 1) a better-than-guide GM decline in 1QF17 and the 2QF17 guide for only a 70 bps GM decline. 2) the FY17 guide for a material improvement in cloud GMs and slowing capex growth. 3) c/c adjusted EPS growth of 10%+ for six consecutive 0.62 0.74 quarters, and 4. improving operating cash flow (OCF) performance. We now estimate that Azure GMs are roughly zero, a significant improvement in the span of three quarters. MSFT’s FY17 guidance for overall GMs to be down 100bps implies a 100bps+ decline in on-premise GMs, which seems too conservative. Combined with continued good opex control, we conclude that we are indeed at a point whereby our FY17 and FY18 EPS estimates now have an upward bias.\nKeirstead is estimating Microsoft will make earnings of $2.83 per share this fiscal year ending in June, and $3.19 per share in 2018.",

Available now in select regions, the app supports the new Rooster Teeth First paid subscription video on demand service, Rooster Teeth First, which provides over 5,000 hours of original content. \nRooster Teeth CEO and co-founder, Matt Hullum, told Variety , “As we’ve expanded into more premium content, where episodes can be up to an hour long, we’ve realized our audience wants the option of a lean-back experience, to watch these shows from their couch, and our new apps support that.” \nExamples of some of Rooster Teeth’s premium content includes new episodes of Day 5, Crunch Time, and their original American anime series, RWBY. \nThe Rooster Teeth app is now available to download on Xbox One consoles and can be found by performing a search in the Store tab. Are you a fan of Rooster Teeth? Which of their shows do you recommend?  ",

      "title": "Microsoft wants your gaming memories for Xbox’s 15th Anniversary",
      "text": "  \nMicrosoft is getting ready for Xbox’s 15th anniversary on November 15th and the company has begun asking fans to share some of their favorite Xbox gaming memories in 10-15 second videos on Twitter. Here’s the message from a post in the official Xbox discussion forums : \nHey Xbox Gamers, November 15th, 2001 is a day I’ll never forget as a video game fan. It was the launch of the Original Xbox. Now, nearly 15 years later I can’t help but reflect on the amazing memories that I’ll always cherish. From the first time I took control of a Warthog in Halo, to the moment I witnessed the magic of Xbox Live connect me to gamers all over the world, it has been an incredible ride that continues to delight. I remember begging my dad to get me an original Xbox at the age of 10, then getting a part time job just to buy an Xbox 360, followed by standing in the freezing cold awaiting the launch of the Xbox One as an adult. Everyone has a story and what makes Xbox special to everyone, is different. \nIf you’d like to share with us your thoughts on the 15th Anniversary of Xbox, we’d love to see it. Here’s how you can: Tweet out a 10-15 second video wishing Xbox a Happy 15th Anniversary and/or what makes Xbox special to you using the hashtag #XboxAmbassadors. We know Xbox wouldn’t be where it is today without this community so we can’t wait to hear from you! \nIt’s unclear exactly how the videos will be used by Microsoft beyond the occasional retweet but more will likely become apparent next week as larger announcements are made concerning the console franchise’s milestone. \nThe original Xbox console launched in North America on November 15th 2001 while its successor, the Xbox 360 , arrived four years later on May 12th 2005. Microsoft’s current console, the Xbox One , premiered in North America on November 22nd 2013, almost three years ago. The Xbox One has been doing very well and has recently outsold Sony’s rival PlayStation 4 console in several regions . \nHow many of these consoles have you owned?  ",

It’s designed to make 3D object creation easy across devices with a regular mouse and keyboard, touchscreens, and stylus input. Sketch a flat drawing with the inflate tool and watch it instantly balloon into a puffy, 3D object, then stick pictures of your dog, a rainbow, or your friend’s faces right onto the 3D models. \nMicrosoft published a preview version of Paint 3D in the Windows Store, free for Windows Insiders to download, install and test out. It requires the Windows 10 Creators Update (Build 14800 and greater).",

      "text": "Microsoft Selfie app finally makes it to the Android platform, almost a year after it was released for iOS .\nTo begin with, the Selfie app was aimed at improving selfies with the use of machine learning. So, once you open the app, you will find options such as choose a photo from the gallery or take a photo. You will then find filters to choose from, just like you see in Instagram. The Selfie app then evaluates age, gender, skin tone, lighting and other variables that help enhance the photo.\nIt is capable of adjusting the exposure, colour balance as well as lighting that eventually help improve the image quality of your selfies. Besides, a user can also choose from colour themes for the images.\nOver the past year, Microsoft has made its keen interest in AI and machine learning quite clear. Recently, the company said it will create a new artificial intelligence unit, as the company pushes deeper into the fast-growing field.\nYou can download the Selfie app for Android from the Google Play store , and Microsoft has also ensured users get to enhance their photos via the web app .\nIt is available for free, and requires a device that runs Android 4.1 and above.\nThe post Microsoft Selfie app now available on Android appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nIn the run-up to the upcoming Windows 10 Creators Update, Microsoft has launched a November Bug Bash for Windows Insiders. If you’re unfamiliar, a Microsoft Bug Bash is a weeklong event during which members of the Windows Insiders program team up to discover and take down bugs lurking in different corners of Windows 10. \nInsiders will be able to use the internal Feedback Hub to choose a number of “Quests,” which will lead them to perform tasks like testing the Windows Subsystem for Linux, or use Microsoft Edge for web browsing. Using familiar MMO terminology, Microsoft has spiced up what is essentially just a standard bug hunt. \nAny bugs that pop up during those quests are reported to Microsoft whose engineering team will be working overtime to, well, bash them. \nRelated: Off the grid gaming: Microsoft shows gamers how to play Windows Store games offline. \nUnfortunately, the focus on the November Bug Bash means this latest Insider Build won’t feature much in the way of new functionality, instead it provides users a way to help out with the Windows 10 development process. Not quite as fun as running an instance in World of Warcraft , but a little more productive. \nLuckily, if you’re a bug-hunting aficionado, this latest Bug Bash likely won’t be the last before the Windows Creators Update goes live early next year. According to MS Power User , we could see at least two more forays into the bug-infested depths of Windows 10. \nIt’s no surprise that the the upcoming Creators Update will be the focus of the Windows Insider program in the coming months, as Microsoft gets it ready for prime time. Instead of testing incremental updates, Insiders will help shape the next major update for Windows 10. \nThe Creators Update will reportedly feature a revamped Paint app, and many other features tailor-made for creative professionals. We first saw the update teased at Microsoft’s event in late October, which saw the introduction of the Surface Studio . Also watch: HP Spectre Review",

      "text": "November 07, 2016, 03:15:56 PM EDT By Karen Webster, SeekingAlpha Shutterstock photo By Karen Webster : \nWilliam Safire wrote a story in The New York Times in 1994 tracing the origin of the phrase. He was prompted to do so when First Lady Hillary Clinton used it in response to a pointed question she was asked during the Whitewater hearings. Safire, in that piece, traced its usage to a number of different situations dating all the way back to 1854. Lexicographers, he concluded, peg the phrase to mean, more or less, \"spare me the useless excuses.\" \nWiktionary takes a bit of a softer stance, defining the phrase as an expression of disappointment over missed opportunities - in other words, regret over not doing something that might have resulted in a different outcome. Rappers and balladeers have written songs about it, too - and the downside of not \"going for it\" in love and life. \nWhatever the use case or application of the phrase, it's typically uttered with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight and often to rationalize why something shoulda been done that also coulda been done and woulda been done - if only things had been different. \nWhich brings me to Steve Ballmer, Microsoft and smartphones. \nJust last week , former Microsoft ( MSFT ) CEO Steve Ballmer invoked the spirit of the phrase to answer a question about how and why Microsoft ended up blowing the smartphone opportunity that was well within its reach in the mid-2000s. \n\"I would have moved into the hardware business faster and recognized that what we had in the PC, where there was a separation of chips, systems and software, wasn't largely gonna reproduce itself in the mobile world.\" \nIn that same interview, Ballmer also suggested that he long advocated for Microsoft to get into the handset business and that his stance on that point strained his relationship with Microsoft Founder Bill Gates. Remember, it was Ballmer who pushed Microsoft to buy Nokia for $7.6 billion in 2013 over the reservations of the board and incoming CEO Satya Nadella. The acquisition was announced weeks after Ballmer made public his intentions of stepping down. Three years later, Microsoft shut down what analysts described as a \"colossal mistake\" and wrote off nearly all of what it paid for the asset. \nIn that same interview, Ballmer also explained away his initial skepticism of Apple ( AAPL ) as his inability to process the \"business model\" innovations that he claimed drove its popularity - the carrier subsidies that made the iPhone cheaper for consumers to buy. \nShoulda-Woulda-Coulda. \nMaybe those lexicographers have a point after all. \nGrab your coffee, and let's go back in time 20 years. \nMICROSOFT AND APPLE MAKE PEACE - AND START A NEW WAR \nOne might say that Microsoft was Apple's smartphone ignition strategy. \nIt was 1997, and Apple was on death's door. Cash-strapped and laboring under the reign of John Sculley, who all but destroyed Apple after he fired Jobs in 1985 (a claim Sculley disputes), Jobs was brought back to the company he founded to save it. In return for non-voting shares and an agreement to drop the lawsuit that accused Microsoft of copying the look and feel of the Mac OS, Jobs persuaded Bill Gates to write Apple a check big enough to get the company back on solid financial footing. Gates also promised to support Office for the Mac for five years - pulling support for this major app would have pushed Apple into oblivion. \nThat served Microsoft well, too, since it came at the same period in time during which Microsoft was embroiled in a nasty antitrust battle over Internet Explorer with the U.S. Department of Justice. The check written to its well-known nemesis was also important symbolism - a way for Gates and Microsoft to soften its reputation as ruthless competitor. At least with Apple still in the game, Microsoft could still argue with a straight face that it wasn't literally a monopolist. \nBut it was also all Jobs and Apple needed to keep its arch-rival thinking that all was copasetic in PC-land, fund the unraveling of just about everything that Sculley did while CEO and field the dream team that has since transformed everything about the music, personal computing and mobile industries. \nWithout this deal, it is pretty unlikely that Apple would have survived or at least had the ability to do all the great things it subsequently did. \nNow, take another sip, and let's fast forward a few years. \nIn 2005, two years before there was an iPhone, there was a small but rapidly growing smartphone market, and Microsoft looked like it was going to extend its Windows monopoly to handsets. \nMicrosoft was second to Symbian then, but growing quickly and with a much more sophisticated operating system. Handset manufacturers, like Motorola with the Motorola Q, rushed to produce handsets that rivaled the most formidable smartphone contender at the time - RIM and BlackBerry ( BBRY ). \nLife was looking pretty good for Microsoft and its command of the mobile market. Analysts predicted that its share of that market would only grow as its grip on the enterprise market expanded - and that Microsoft would become the leading mobile OS by 2010. \nWe all know what happened next. \nAPPLE AND THE TWO FORKS IN THE SMARTPHONE ROAD \nOn Jan. 10, 2007, Steve Jobs introduced the iPhone and brought the smartphone market to its knees. \nLike the Mac that changed the whole computer industry and the iPod that changed the whole music industry, the iPhone, Jobs said, would change the mobile industry forever - not to mention the fortunes of every player in the smartphone business. \nThe iPhone, Jobs said, \"skated to where the puck is going\" instead of where it had been - a not-so-subtle slap at the phones that were in the market at that time. It was quite clear that he and Apple didn't want to create a smaller and better-looking mini PC that could connect to the internet and do email. Jobs reinvented the notion of what a smartphone could do by making a device that ditched keyboards for touch screens and a virtual keyboard and that made accessing the internet an app - and a year later, an app store with hundreds of apps - away. \nJobs got everyone's attention - including Microsoft's. Ballmer's reaction at that time was, more or less, denial. \n\"(This) is the most expensive phone in the world. And it doesn't appeal to business customers because it doesn't have a keyboard, which makes it not a very good email machine.\" \nSo, Microsoft doubled down on its strategy - basically miniaturizing the Windows mobile OS for phones that would continue to look like and function like mini PCs. \nMeanwhile, a few hundred miles away , Andy Rubin, Rich Miner and a slew of engineers were working on creating an operating system that would best Microsoft. That OS was Android, which Google ( GOOG ) ( GOOGL ) acquired in 2005. For two years, teams were nose to the grindstone testing software, securing licensing agreements and getting handset manufacturers on board in anticipation of a year-end 2007 launch. \nThat all changed when the team at Google saw what Jobs and Apple had created with the iPhone. \nUnlike Ballmer, they didn't pooh-pooh it and continue on their merry way. \n\" As a consumer, I was blown away. I wanted one immediately. But as a Google engineer, I thought, 'We're going to have to start over,'\" one of Android's lead engineers, Chris DeSalvo , said. \nWhat the team at Google did instead was junk everything they'd been working on for two years and started over. \nNearly two years later, in September of 2008, the Android OS was released, and a month later, the first handset running it was introduced. Android's strategy was to create a robust and flexible OS that would offer handset manufacturers and carriers a way to embrace the Apple smartphone vision and enable them to compete with it across all handset price points - anywhere in the world. Apps and an app store (Google Play) were also big parts of their strategy. Developers who were developing apps for the iPhone now had a whole new world to leverage. \nMicrosoft, in the meantime, watched its share of the smartphone market tank. \nThe earlier predictions of its supreme reign over the mobile OS system were retracted quicker than you could say Bob's your uncle . The double whammy of the introduction of Apple and Android and its army of handset manufacturers embracing its OS quickly drove Microsoft to less than a 5 percent share of the smartphone market by 2010. \nHARDWARE AS SAVIOR? \nClearly, no one other than Apple saw the iPhone coming and the transformation of the industry that it would portend. \nBut here's an important point - and one that Ballmer sort of skipped right over last week. \nAt its core, Apple is a hardware company. And as such, Jobs and company understood well that selling more gear meant that Apple had to give consumers a reason to buy that gear. That, as it had demonstrated with the iPod, was the ability to access content consumers wanted in ways that they never could before - and could only do via those devices. \nThat meant that Apple needed developers as much as it needed anyone. \nSo, apps and the App Store became the bait that moved sales of the iPhone. Developers were given access to SDKs with hooks to iPhone features and functions that would make their apps more robust. Apple also provided a financial incentive that paid developers 70 percent of any sales they made. \nGreat developer tools drove the creation of more apps, and more apps drove more iPhone sales. At the end of the first weekend of the App Store's official launch in July 2008, the App Store saw more than 10 million app downloads. By October of 2008, more than 10 million iPhones had been sold. \nAndroid took a different tack - and in many ways, a play straight out of Microsoft's playbook. \nLike Microsoft and Windows for the PC, Android's MO was to get as many phones running Android as it could by making its OS available to as many handset manufacturers and carriers as wanted it. Android gave developers an SDK toolkit that also included hardware specs to test their apps with a variety of handset manufacturers. But instead of a licensing fee, Android made money from the advertising revenues that accompanied the bundle of apps that came installed as part of the Android OS. \nThat worked pretty well, too. \nIn 2010, analysts reported that Android market share had grown 900 percent - from 6.7 million units sold in 2009 to 67.2 million units and a 22.7 percent share in 2010. That put it ahead of BlackBerry and Apple (46.6 million units and 15.7 percent market share) and second only to Nokia/Symbian. \nMicrosoft, in the meantime, was in the midst of a death spiral - a platform strategy that was unraveling. Developers were developing apps for handsets that consumers wanted to buy. And consumers didn't want to buy handsets in 2008, 2009 and 2010 that looked like mini PCs running Windows Mobile. They wanted iPhones, and even the \"it'll be a cold day in you-know-where before I ever give up my BlackBerry\" purists were - guess what - giving up their CrackBerries by the millions. Consumers wanted iPhones and Android devices that gave them apps and a new way to engage with a mobile device. And where there were consumers, there were developers itching to serve them. And handset manufacturers itching to have consumers buy from them. \nThat wasn't Microsoft any longer. In 2010, Microsoft was a distant fifth place contender with 12.3 million units sold and a 4.3 percent share of the smartphone market. \nSo, was Ballmer right? Should Microsoft have approached the smartphone market differently? Yes, it sure should have. It should have realized in 2007 that Microsoft's real competitor wasn't Apple, but Google. \nWhen Google saw what Apple had created, it quickly recognized that its competitor wasn't Microsoft but Apple. And it pivoted dramatically to develop an OS and vision for an overall hardware-software platform that would bring that same functionality to as many handsets and carriers that wanted to compete with Apple. Microsoft had a ton of handset and carrier relationships in place and could have done the same thing. But instead it kept true to an OS strategy that supported the status quo that no longer drove handset sales. That gave Google all the runway it needed to capture the market at Microsoft's expense. \nIt should have remembered how money gets made in a two-sided market. \nMicrosoft didn't become a $454 billion company by not doing a lot of things right. And one of the things that Microsoft has done right is recognizing that software platforms make money by getting lots of devices to run them and lots of developers to use them. 60 percent of Microsoft's revenues is from licensing its Office suite of products. \nMicrosoft didn't have to make smartphones to make money from the sale of them. It made a boatload - and still does - when other devices run its OS. \nBut it did have to create an environment that would court developers and get them jazzed about making cool apps for the devices that consumers were buying. When consumers stopped buying devices that were running Windows OS, developers stopped developing. When developers stopped developing, phones become even less attractive to consumers. \nAnd so it went. \nIt should have recognized that hardware and software are very different businesses. Microsoft had a shot at making a phone in 2010 in the Ballmer years. Remember the Kin ? I'll bet you don't. \nThe Kin was Microsoft's billion-dollar attempt to create a smartphone for that burgeoning market of 15- to 30-year-old women who wanted a device only to interact with their social network. No apps, no games, no data plan - and running a fork of the Windows Mobile OS that made it extremely hard for developers to want to give a Kin. Not surprisingly, Microsoft discontinued the line in 2011. (You can still buy one today on eBay for about $18.) \nBuying Nokia in 2013 wasn't only too little (well, as little as a $7 billion acquisition can be) too late but set up a raft of conflicts for Microsoft. Not only was Nokia on its last legs as a handset manufacturer, but with that acquisition, Microsoft became an instant competitor to anyone who might have been interested in licensing the Windows Mobile OS. That might have been OK if consumers were buying Nokia phones like there was no tomorrow - but they weren't. So, developers had even fewer incentives to spend time developing apps for either scenario. It was a lose-lose all the way around. \nGoogle, by the way, ran into the same brick wall with its $12.5 billion acquisition of Motorola in 2011. GOOG said that it bought the company for its patents, but handset manufacturers began hedging their bets by forking versions of Android that were different enough to blunt some of Android's control. Google dumped Motorola three years later in 2014 for $2.1 billion after suffering the double whammy of not making any money via the acquisition and driving its channel partners in different directions. \nSHOULDA-WOULDA-COULDA. \nDidn't. \nThat's the part of the Hillary Clinton response that really drove William Safire to research the meaning of the phrase. He marveled at the candor and brevity of response wrapped up in those four words. \nBallmer clearly believes that Microsoft shoulda and coulda gotten deeper into the smartphone market by making them. And it woulda if he had his way. \nIt's a good thing it didn't. \nWithout a willingness to let go of the status quo, it would have been years upon years of distraction away from the core businesses and likely billions upon billions of red ink as a result. It's one of the hardest lessons to learn but one of the most important ones for payments and commerce execs to take on board - particularly as innovation and new technologies increasingly challenge the status quo and the players who are the custodians of the way \"things have always been done.\" \nThe trick, though, is to have a framework that can identify the ideas that are worth junking two years' worth of work for - taking those lumps and starting a new - from the ones that are interesting but not worth getting distracted over. \nAll the while, making sure that even the so-called status quo doesn't stand still. \nSo, who's at risk today? You tell me. \nMaybe not Microsoft anymore. \nUntil Nadella took over as CEO in Feb. 2014, there didn't appear to be much of an appetite on the part of Microsoft and Team Ballmer to do anything more than see life through a Windows Mobile OS lens that, from a smartphone standpoint, didn't excite consumers, developers or handset manufacturers. It was a lens that investors didn't seem to like much either. \nUnder Ballmer's 14-year tenure, Microsoft's stock dropped 40 percent (and surged 8 percent on the news of his departure.) Over that same period of time, which had the financial crisis sandwiched in between, the Nasdaq declined about 10 percent. \nSince Nadella has taken charge, the stock has increased 60 percent. He's refocused the business around its core - software and services - and seems to be investing in making that core stronger. \nApple? \nIronically, the device that launched a thousand imitators and tanked one OS in particular - Windows - seems to struggle now to create the \"one more thing\" that is exciting enough for consumers to want to buy new devices. Investors aren't happy either - Apple's stock is down 11 percent over the last year. It hasn't produced a real dud, like the Kin, yet, but it has seen a streak of product introductions that just haven't sizzled. If I were at Apple now, I'd be worried that someone somewhere is creating a device that would make the iPhone look like your dad's Palm Pilot.",

      "text": "• @mggjim \nWindows 10 introduces many new features and apps , and Microsoft therefore wants to ensure that users are aware of all of the new things that the operating system and its built-in apps can do. The company’s solution for “educating” its customers is to occasionally display notifications and pop-ups related to the new features. While some users new to Windows 10 may appreciate these “suggestions,” as Microsoft calls them, most users simply find them annoying. Here’s how to turn them off. \n  \nNote that Windows 10 has gone through several major updates since its initial release in 2015. The screenshots and steps presented here are based on the “ Anniversary Update ,” released in Fall 2016. If you’re reading this article at a later date, be sure to check which version of Windows 10 you’re using, as the steps and interface may have changed in subsequent updates. Turn Off Windows 10 Tips, Tricks, and Suggestions \nTo disable system-wide tips and notifications related to Windows 10 features, first click on the Start Menu and select Settings . \nFrom the Settings screen, head to System > Notifications & Actions . Scroll down in the list of options on the right until you see a toggle labeled Get tips, tricks, and suggestions as you use Windows . \nTurn this option Off to disable the notification-based alerts that you receive regarding features like Cortana , the Weather and Maps apps, and other software such as Microsoft Office . \nWant  ",

      "text": "Whatever you do, don’t purchase the Windows 10 Edition of Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare (IW) from the Microsoft Store. The Store version of IW is currently the cheapest version available, but it’s a crippled version.\nMicrosoft has received its fair share of flack for the Microsoft Store in the past, most notably from Epic Games founder, Tim Sweeney . Developers and gamers have accused Microsoft of forcing a buggy, semi-functional platform on gamers. Complaints range from the lack of SLI support, forced v-sync, system instability and a lot more.\nTo give Microsoft its due, the company has addressed most of these issues to everyone’s satisfaction. It’s not perfect and definitely nowhere near as comfortable as Steam, but it’s getting there.\nEnter IW.\n\nAt a time when gamers are demanding the very best experience from developers, when multiplayer is essential to the longevity of any title (there are always exceptions of course), Activision released a game with little to no multiplayer support.\nAm I off my rocker? No. IW does in fact support multiplayer on the Microsoft Store for the Windows 10 version of IW, but critically, doesn’t support cross-play with players on Steam or Xbox. If you buy the Store edition of IW, you’ll only be able to play against other players who bought the game on the Microsoft Store.\nGuess how many those are.\nIf Reddit user Hayz00s is to be believed , his sibling found two players — yes, two — when looking for a multiplayer game in Modern Warfare Remastered (part of the IW bundle). Others report a maximum of 150 players on IW’s multiplayer servers at any given time. That’s as good as not having any multiplayer at all.\nContrast this with steam, where over 15,000 players were playing the game at peak and thousands of players at any given moment. By the way, even that figure is abysmal in comparison to the previous game, which had over 63,000 concurrent players at its peak.\nHayz00s’ sibling managed to get a refund from Microsoft, a process that he said was very straightforward.\nActivision should have known better, however. Why would you not integrate Steam support when Microsoft explicitly allows you to do so?\n\nThe post Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare: Microsoft isn’t to blame for game’s Store woes on Windows 10 appeared first on Tech2 .",

The new enhancements are now available to try at no cost through the Dynamics NAV 2017 demo environment at goERPcloud, announced goERPcloud, today. \nMicrosoft Dynamics NAV 2017 offers new features to improve core NAV functionality, new capabilities to improve cloud based deployment, and more seamless integration to CRM, Office 365 and Power BI for added intelligence. \nDynamics 365 was recently launched by Microsoft as a fully cloud based business management platform product with “Dynamics 365 for Financials” based on Dynamics NAV.

Putting Dynamics NAV 2017 into the hands of Dynamics Partners and Customers on a trial basis allows them to start planning upgrade strategies early and gives new customers the latest and greatest tools available in NAV as they see the app for the first time.” \nDynamics NAV 2017 adds improved search features for faster item lookups and improved project management through a new Jobs Setup Wizard, a new My Jobs list and an updated Project Management Role Center. The goERPcloud trial experience includes a full version of NAV 2017 that can be set up and ready to test drive in four simple steps with no credit card or commitment. \nFor more information on updates refer to the Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Capabilities Guide . \nAbout goERPcloud goERPcloud is the first on-demand Microsoft Dynamics Cloud Marketplace that allows you to test drive different flavors of Microsoft Dynamics AX, GP, NAV and SL with preconfigured 3rd party ISV applications. goERPcloud boasts a robust ecosystem of Microsoft Dynamics Partners, helping businesses find the cloud-based software solutions that best fit their current and future business needs.

You probably know that it’s important. But you might not understand exactly what kind of impact it can have on your business or how you can best utilize it as a business tool. Since there are many different cloud based tools and features, it can be a good idea to get different perspectives to help you make the most out of it for your small business. And you have the opportunity to get some of those different perspectives as part of an upcoming Twitter chat. The Microsoft-sponsored Twitter chat “Ways to Leverage the Cloud to Grow Your Business,” will take place on Thursday, November 10, at 1 p.m. EST.",

      "text": "Microsoft Could Launch Windows 10 Redstone 4 in Early 2018 GO Report claims a fourth Windows 10 update is in the works Nov 8, 2016 08:25 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft is already working on the second Redstone update for Windows 10, but the company is planning in advance, and it turns out that the fourth release is already being looked into at the Redmond-based software giant. A new report from WindowsCentral indicates that Windows 10 Redstone 4 is due in early 2018, and while there’s no confirmation in this regard, it aligns with previous rumors pointing out that Microsoft would launch two Windows 10 updates every year. Next year, for example, Microsoft is projected to introduce the Redstone 2 update (officially called Creators Update) in early 2017, most likely in March, but also Windows 10 Redstone 3, which should land in the fall of next year. Of course, it’s just too early to get a confirmation from Microsoft that such an update is in the works, as the next big thing for the company is Redstone 2 and it should go live in the spring. Windows 10 Creators Update Windows 10 Redstone 2, officially called Creators Update, is playing quite a key role for Microsoft, as it opens the door to 3D content, which seems to become a key focus for the software giant. Redmond wants every user to get access to the 3D world, so the Creators Update will include features specifically developed in this regard, including the new Paint 3D app that’s available in preview for Windows insiders. Rumor has it that Redstone 2 will launch as version 1703, which is a direct hint at the its release date, as Microsoft often uses versions whose numbers represent the year and the month when a certain update goes live – in the case of the Creators Update, 17 represents the year (2017), while 03 is the month (March). Microsoft itself confirmed that Windows 10 Redstone 2 would make its debut in “early 2017,” but specifics are not yet available.",

      "text": "Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare Windows 10 wasteland is Activision’s fault, Microsoft says, cheerfully refunds lonely players   05:18   \nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare on the Windows 10 store – not even once. \nCall of Duty: Infinite Warfare isn’t having a very jolly launch on PC, as I noticed yesterday when idly admiring Civilization 6’s sterling performance , and one can’t help but wonder if Activision has kind of given up on the platform. \nI mean, take this Windows 10 Store business. When we found out that Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare has no multiplayer between Windows 10 and Steam , my first thought was “classic Microsoft: shooting itself in the foot trying to get one over Steam”. But now it turns out this is something Activision chose to do, and I don’t know about you but I am just completely baffled by it. \nThe news comes via Windows Central , citing an anonymous source at first and then following up with a statement from a Microsoft spokesperson: “We support cross-play between devices and platforms for partners who want to enable it.” Apparently Activision didn’t want to. \nThe good news is Microsoft will give you your money back of you buy Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare from the Windows 10 Store and then realise you have nobody to play with. One user who got a refund told Motherboard they found just two players in the generally popular team deathmatch playlist – two ! – and there’s a screenshot to verify it. Microsoft politely gave their money back without any dramas. \nAt time of writing, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare had 4,242 players on Steam with a daily peak concurrence of 11,122, which is healthy if not spectacular. Multiplatform, it’s not selling as well as Call of Duty: Black Ops 3 did . Keep it in perspective, though – an off year for Call of Duty is still usually means five or six times the sales of any other blockbuster. \nStill, it’s fun to speculate on the lull this year. Is it Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare’s science fiction leanings? The unfortunate coincidence of Battlefield 1 going further back in time? The fact that Battlefield had a very strong launch instead of the usual disaster? The apparently excellent Titanfall dropping so soon after? \nOne thing I do know: it’s never wise to declare that Call of Duty is over. People were saying that right before Modern Warfare 2, y’know?

      "title": "Fearless Forecast: 'Microsoft Teams' Can Extinguish Slack's Rapid Growth",
      "text": "Summary \nMicrosoft is the leader in Collaboration SaaS. However, Slack is emerging as a potent rival. \nAs of last month, Slack already touts 4 million daily active users. Slack also has 1.25 million paying users. \nSquashing emerging rivals like Slack is necessary. Microsoft Teams is a free Slack-like group chat tool for Office 365 Business subscribers. \nMicrosoft Teams for Office 365 could eventually outgrow Slack in team-based enterprise communication. \nThe free Microsoft Teams app also hurts the growth potential of Facebook Workplace enterprise collaboration service. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) has released its equalizer to Slack's enterprise team communication product . Microsoft Teams is a new group chat and collaboration app for employees and team members. It is a free Slack-like tool that could be activated by administrators of Office 365 for Business subscribers. It was reported earlier this year that Microsoft considered buying Slack for $8 billion but Nadella and Bill Gates rejected it. Microsoft now wants to douse Slack's future growth potential. Office 365 now has 24 million paying customers. It is therefore my fearless forecast that Microsoft Teams could quickly beat the 4 million DAU (Daily Active Users) of Slack. Click to enlarge (SOURCE: SLACK ) Squeezing out Slack Microsoft is the leader in Enterprise Collaboration SaaS (Software-as-a-Service). It is only logical for Microsoft to try and prevent emerging rivals like Slack from growing too big. I understand why Slack might be pretty nervous over Microsoft Teams. Slack's rapid growth could quickly get doused by Microsoft Teams. Microsoft's release of Office 365 handily beat the early promoter of online productivity and collaboration suite, Alphabet's Google Apps for Work. Microsoft holds sway (or the boss shepherd) in the enterprise software market. it can release a new product like Teams and most enterprise users will probably heed whatever Microsoft tells them to use. The early investors of Slack might not like it, but I predict Slack is unlikely to hit 6 million DAU after the release of Microsoft Teams. The ubiquity of Office 365 in the enterprise makes Microsoft Teams the better default group chat app for employees. Microsoft Teams is an all-in-one teamwork communication and productivity tool. Click to enlarge (Source: Microsoft) Big and small teams could customize Microsoft Teams workspaces to best suite their daily productivity workflow. Like Slack, Microsoft Teams also allows users to integrate custom apps . Bots could be programmed to automatically provide information or answers to queries inside Microsoft Teams. The Tabs option is where custom software could be integrated to improve the overall experience. Click to enlarge (Source: Microsoft) Aside from being a headwind for Slack's future growth, Microsoft Teams could also inspire some of the 1.25 million paid Slack users to defect. I suspect that many of those 1.25 million are also paying customers of Office 365. A 3,000-strong Slack/Office 365 Business customer could save $24,000 every month if it makes a switch to Microsoft Teams. Microsoft Teams is absolutely free for business subscribers of Office 365. Slack charges $8 and $15 monthly plans for its team chat product. Protecting Its Lead Microsoft's act of going after Slack's business is just prudent. Microsoft had 20% of the global Collaboration Applications Market last year. Its estimated revenue was $1.4 billion (out of $7.1 billion total). Microsoft doesn't want Slack to become too popular that it could threaten its big lead in Collaboration Applications. Click to enlarge (Source: Appsruntheworld.com) The obvious risk is that Slack could grow big enough to attract the attention of Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL ), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ), and Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO ). Any of those firms could buy Slack and use it to chip away at Microsoft's lead in Collaboration Applications. Conclusion Microsoft Teams is another reason for us to stay long MSFT. Nadella's reported rejection of the idea of buying Slack was judicious. It probably cost no more than $10 million to create the Slack-like Microsoft Teams app. It was also shrewd of Microsoft to Integrate Teams as a free option for business subscribers of Office 365.Sad but true, the best things in life are free. Slack will find it difficult to sustain its growth rate when Microsoft is offering a free alternative. Microsoft might also release an update for Office 365 that automatically activates Microsoft Teams for Office 365 Business plan subscribers. This way Microsoft Teams could ingratiate itself faster with the 24 million Office 365 subscribers. Aside from hurting the growth potential of Slack, the free Microsoft Teams app is also definitely aimed at Facebook's (NASDAQ: FB ) $1/$2/$3 per user monthly cloud collaboration service, Workplace. Yes, ad-dependent Facebook is gradually encroaching in Microsoft's SaaS territory. A free Microsoft Teams group chat and collaboration app is still more cost effective than a $1/month Workplace account. Like Slack, Facebook's Workplace will also find it hard to attract customers when Microsoft released a free alternative. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT, GOOG, FB.

      "text": "  07:03 AM EST Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Ready to Try at goERPcloud PRWeb \nMicrosoft announced the release of its new version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV, made generally available October 27, with the latest functionality enhancements exclusive to Dynamics NAV 2017. The new enhancements are now available to try at no cost through the Dynamics NAV 2017 demo environment at goERPcloud, announced goERPcloud, today. \nMicrosoft Dynamics NAV 2017 offers new features to improve core NAV functionality, new capabilities to improve cloud based deployment, and more seamless integration to CRM, Office 365 and Power BI for added intelligence. \nDynamics 365 was recently launched by Microsoft as a fully cloud based business management platform product with \"Dynamics 365 for Financials\" based on Dynamics NAV. While Dynamics 365 for Financials offers some of NAV's functionality, a full version of Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 can be launched quickly in the cloud through RoseASP, a Dynamics Cloud Partner and the power behind goERPcloud. \n\"As the corporate IT landscape moves toward a cloud-first model, demand for the latest versions of software like Dynamics NAV has increased,\" said Jeffrey DeMaria, goERPcloud Product Manager. \"One of goERPcloud's core goals is to enable Dynamics Customers and Partners to stay ahead of the curve by quickly delivering trials of all Microsoft Dynamics ERP new releases shortly after they are made available. Putting Dynamics NAV 2017 into the hands of Dynamics Partners and Customers on a trial basis allows them to start planning upgrade strategies early and gives new customers the latest and greatest tools available in NAV as they see the app for the first time.\" \nDynamics NAV 2017 adds improved search features for faster item lookups and improved project management through a new Jobs Setup Wizard, a new My Jobs list and an updated Project Management Role Center. The goERPcloud trial experience includes a full version of NAV 2017 that can be set up and ready to test drive in four simple steps with no credit card or commitment. \nFor more information on updates refer to the Microsoft Dynamics NAV 2017 Capabilities Guide . \nAbout goERPcloud goERPcloud is the first on-demand Microsoft Dynamics Cloud Marketplace that allows you to test drive different flavors of Microsoft Dynamics AX, GP, NAV and SL with preconfigured 3rd party ISV applications. goERPcloud boasts a robust ecosystem of Microsoft Dynamics Partners, helping businesses find the cloud-based software solutions that best fit their current and future business needs.

Would make sense. theres an advert in the metro today as well for a different bundle although doesn't appear to be live yet Insider knowledge on that occasion? Yep, looks like a 1TB Elite in that photo. You can be an **** all you like, night night! I'm not been an ass I just asked a question. You knew something we didn't pal so I asked. Just sounds a bit petty. I know you asked but I'm not sure if I'm allowed to say how I know so I didn't. After all, it is a deals website and not one that requires substantial evidence other than the website offering the item at that price. I have no evidence I can show that says this is a clearance of the old models, but it is. Chanchi posting what they did a good 20 minutes after I posted the deal with the other prices was merely backing up what I said. I don't know when the metro is posted online but I didn't see it from there. I imagine it will be trickling onto gaming blog sites over the next few hours as people turn on computers and see their emails etc... Idiot! Did I ask for proof? Your link provided that, I. Asked how you knew because you made out like you was the boss. You made this longer than it had to be.",

      "text": "Microsoft Offering Refunds For Call Of Duty Purchased From Windows 10 Store 9:29 am By Conner Flynn \nThere was news the other day telling us that if you bought the Windows 10 Store version of Activision’s Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, it would not be playable with other copies of the game that were bought outside of the Windows 10 Store, like Steam for instance. So this means that if you wanted to play with a friend who bought it on Steam, you are out of luck. Which is pretty silly, hence people being frustrated. \nWell we have some good news. Microsoft will refund you the price of the game if you want. It looks like Microsoft is willing to hand out refunds if you bought the game from the Windows 10 Store. This is based on a post on Reddit where hayz00s claims his little brother bought the game from the Windows 10 Store and his brother called Microsoft to request a refund and it was given easily. We can only assume they will give it to you as well. \nhayz00s says, “It was very easy. He said they were very courteous and didn’t give him any trouble trying to get the refund.” The only reason his brother went with the Windows 10 Store version was because it was cheaper. I guess there are times when it does not pay to be cheap. It looks like it was Activision’s decision to make the game run on separate servers for PC. We don’t know why this decision was made, but it makes Windows Store look bad.",

      "text": "By Vlad Dudau News Editor Neowin LLC @avladd · 4 seconds ago with 0 comments The Xbox One S - an iterative step towards the unified platform \nFor years now, Microsoft has been diligently working on a strategy to converge its gaming ecosystems on Xbox and Windows. Though we’ve seen bits and pieces of these efforts show up, it won’t be until the launch of Xbox Scorpio next year, when the company’s vision fully comes to life. \nThe company’s struggles and strategy to bring together Xbox and Windows gaming are bundled together in a single strand, codenamed Project Helix. Originally publicized by Kotaku earlier this year, Project Helix involves creating one platform, that allows easy access and performant tools for developers to craft games, while giving varied choices and mobility to the player base to move around in the ecosystem. Phil Spencer showing off the Universal Xbox app on Windows \nIf this sounds familiar to you, it’s because you might be thinking of the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). That’s the runtime that Microsoft developed for all of its Windows ecosystems, which has largely the same mission statement as Project Helix. And that’s by no means an accident, seeing as the UWP is an integral part of the company’s gaming ambitions. \nWe’ve already seen how efforts on the part of the Xbox and Windows teams have come together to open up both platforms, and this collaboration will only deepen going forward. While originally relying on a naked Windows kernel to power the Xbox, the two platforms have grown much closer in recent years , culminating in the Universal Windows Platform now being supported by the Xbox One. We’ve seen how this move has unified the Windows and Xbox Stores , and is now bringing universal apps to the Xbox, since the launch of the Anniversary Edition update on the console. Forza Apex is entirely on UWP, and it's 4K chops point to the future \nWe’re also seeing how UWP apps and support on Windows 10 are bringing Xbox titles over to the desktop platform. The doomed Fable Legends game was one of the first games to come to Windows and Xbox simultaneously and also to allow cross-play and support for the Xbox Play Anywhere platform . However, other titles are faring much better including Forza Apex , Gears of War 4 , ReCore and Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare , have all launched on both platforms, through the now-Universal Windows Store, and running on the UWP platform. \nWith each subsequent title launch and platform update, Microsoft is making cross-compatibility, and the Universal platform as a whole, more robust, and more capable. And it’s exactly these advances that are letting Microsoft unify the two gaming platforms, Xbox and Windows 10, into a single ecosystem. \nBut Project Helix will truly come to fruition when the Xbox Scorpio launches. The new device, expected to become available next year, ahead of the holiday season, will be the most powerful console ever created . Scorpio will rely on the Universal Windows Platform, not just for apps but for some games also. Windows Central is citing an unnamed source, who’s reiterating many of the things that Microsoft has previously said publicly, including that Scorpio will be rendering games, be they UWP or XDK-developed, natively at 4K . Xbox Scorpio will be the keystone in Microsoft's gaming strategy \nOf course, Scorpio, while offering backwards compatibility with existing titles, will become the primary console that devs work on. Because of its higher performance, the device will be a “one-stop shop” for developers, who’ll be able to scale the device’s specs to test out games and target all platforms at the same time: Windows, Xbox One, Xbox Scorpio. They’ll be able to create a single package, that will know which type of device is using it, and load the appropriate resources. \nThe unified ecosystem will all be based around the UWP platform and run through the Windows Store, though XDK will still be highly important. As this comes to pass, Microsoft will finally have a unified, integrated ecosystem, capable of sustaining its users across all platforms. \nWhether this succeeds in any meaningful way in the market remains to be seen. Steam is still the dominant platform on PC, and for good reason. Microsoft’s recent missteps with the launch of the latest Call of Duty as a Universal app, have highlighted the nascent platform’s weakness. If users continue to ignore the Windows Store and Microsoft fails to entice them, Project Helix may be little more than an technical achievement. But you don’t get any Gs for trying.",

      "text": "I’ve seen a few tweets around about Microsoft and the open-source journey, and they made me take a look back at the Microsoft account on GitHub to see whether there was something that I’d missed. Whether or not there are all new projects loading up onto GitHub, there is absolutely a lot going on in a lot of different repositories. This is great!\nMS Open Tech Has Become Strong Inside Microsoft The Microsoft Open Technologies website had called out the change before the middle of last year. The website notes that no new content would be posted as of July 1, 2015. That didn’t mark the end of open technologies. It actually marked the start of even more open projects within the core of Microsoft.\nMixing open and closed technologies is not new. Many of the companies who are becoming heavy contributors to open-source projects are still maintaining a strong presence in both open ecosystems and proprietary, closed ecosystems. Microsoft, VMware, EMC, and many of the big tech vendors are showing up more at open events, and on GitHub.\nThe next wave of open technologies may very well be powered by some closed-source giants. This is kind of like a renaissance.\nMicrosoft on GitHub \nImage Source \nTake a look at the activity by the Microsoft GitHub organization to see what I mean. You can scroll from page to page and see the last updated times and dates. There are dozens upon dozens that have been updated in recent days, and even in recent hours, at the time that I wrote this. How cool is that?!\nThere are projects of all sorts that are there, and of course, there are recent updates such as PowerShell on Linux and other very exciting moves by Microsoft to embrace more open platforms. The open source .NET ecosystem will be the dawn of a new area of growth that Microsoft will enable for their existing customers, and for new ones that may have been holding back due to concerns of being locked into proprietary solutions.\nOpen Lock-In Is Still Real One thing that can be confusing is that open means that non-proprietary. I use the term Open Lock-In to describe this. Open source does not equate to an open platform in the way that many tout the offerings. If you run an application using an open source technology, regardless of what it is, you are most likely a little locked in. That’s all good. How often do you honestly need to pick up and port your application from platform to platform?!\nThis is why I make sure to ask folks to do the measurement against the requirements of any of the platforms. Open source is a great way to embrace community-driven development that can be heavily backed by proprietary technology vendors. That’s really the perfect pairing because you know that the revenue streams are maintaining the core business while supporting open technologies at the same time. Remember: running an open-source platform and an open-source business are two very different things.\nOpenMicrosoftStack? I’m holding out hope for some more OpenStack integration with Microsoft. That may be more of a personal playground than anything, but it’s also a good opportunity to have Microsoft latch onto the OpenStack ecosystem. Perhaps we will see a full set of OpenStack compatible APIs along with the launch of Azure Stack. We may see more work around running Nano Server as a containerized guest so that it can be leveraged for it’s strong points on any underlying infrastructure.\nNo matter how you look at it, Microsoft is clearly leaning heavily into open source in a lot of the right ways. There will come a day where we won’t even remember how it was, as the next generation of Microsoft servers, applications, and development technologies become easier to consume across the open-source ecosystem.",

      "title": "Surface Pro 5 release rumors: Device to arrive within the first quarter of 2017",
      "text": "  \n(Microsoft Official) Shown in the photo is the Microsoft Surface Pro 4. According to latest rumors, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 will arrive within the first quarter of 2016. \nAfter it failed to make an appearance at the Microsoft event last Oct. 26, it may not take long before consumers can get their hands on the Surface Pro 5 as the device may arrive in the market within the first quarter of 2017. \nAlthough there were some who were skeptical whether the Surface Pro 5 would arrive at Microsoft's event late last month, it can't be denied that there were still some Microsoft fans who hoped that the device would be unveiled. At the end of the event , though, the skeptics were right as not even a mention of the Surface Pro 5 happened as it was the Surface Studio, Surface Book i7, and the Surface Dial, that took the center stage. \nThe disappointment was soon replaced with renewed excitement, though, as just days after the Microsoft event, rumors claiming that the Surface Pro 5 may arrive between January and March next year have dominated the Internet. Reportedly, the device will be released along with the launch of the Surface Book 2 and the alleged Surface Phone. \nApart from being alleged to arrive early next year, there are also numerous rumors as to what the Surface Pro 5 will offer. However, one of the most loudly rumored features of the Surface Pro 5 is its Surface Pen. While it's true that the current version of the device already comes with its own Surface Pen, the one to arrive with the Surface Pro 5 is said to automatically charge when it docks magnetically on the device. Advertisement \nOn the other hand, there are some rumors claiming that the Surface Pro 5 will run on Intel Sky Lake. Nonetheless, rumors claiming that the device will pack the Intel Kaby Lake processor are much louder. In fact, it is even said that it is the very reason why the Surface Pro 5 was not launched last month as the latest chipset from Intel was only shipped out recently. \nIn the event that the Surface Pro 5 really arrives within the first quarter of next year, it can finally be confirmed if speculations on what the device will offer are true or not. After all, CNET opines that the Surface Pro 5 has finally convinced tech fans that the laptop can be replaced by a tablet. \nAccording to the said online publication, Microsoft's Surface line has set the trend that is now being copied by other big tech brands in the market today, such as Apple and Google, both of which have taken inspiration from the Surface's snap-on keyboard and the Surface's line of versatility features.

This goes on until I manually clear the queue, and restart the print-spooler. As far as I have seen, the only program with printing issues is Edge. \nIs this a driver issue?

      "text": "Lenovo to Launch Windows Phone after Blasting Microsoft for Mobile Strategy GO The SoftBank 503LV will be introduced next week Nov 8, 2016 09:01 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft expressed its commitment to Windows 10 Mobile on several occasions, and the company said that it’s supporting partners who want to build devices running this OS, but until now, the number of firms interested in such a thing is not at all overwhelming. Furthermore, some of the firms that considered building a Windows Phone, as it’s the case of Lenovo, criticized Microsoft for its mobile strategy, explaining that not even the software giant believes in its mobile platform strong enough to release devices running it. And yet, it turns out that Lenovo is actually ready to invest in Windows 10 Mobile and the company is now close to releasing a device that runs the operating system. A company executive confirmed that the SoftBank 503LV would be introduced this month, after several teasers that made it to the web earlier this year. Mid-range Windows phone The SoftBank 503LV is essentially a mid-range Windows phone that comes with a 5-inch LCD display with a resolution of 1280x720 pixels and is powered by a Qualcomm 617 processor clocked at 1.5 GHz. The device features 3GB RAM and 32GB of internal storage, but just like the majority of Windows phones out there, microSD card support is also offered in order to expand storage to a maximum of 128 GB. Lenovo also installed an 8-megapixel camera on the back and a 5-megapixel unit on the front for selfies and video calls. The phone gets its power from a 2250 mAh battery that should provide at least one day of autonomy. At this moment, pricing information is not available just yet, but Lenovo should disclose full details later this month when the new phone goes on sale. Previously, it was believed that the phone could go on sale exclusively in Japan, but now it seems that there are plans to make it available in some other markets as well.",

      "text": "New Realtek HD Audio Build Is Available - Get Version 6.0.1.7977 Microsoft’s release supports Windows 10 and 10 Anniversary Nov 8, 2016 12:15 GMT · By Iulian Pascal · Share: A few moments ago, the new 6.0.1.7977 Realtek HD Audio driver surfaced on Microsoft’s Update Catalog and it's compatible with both 32- and 64-bit variants of Windows 10 and 10 Anniversary Editions. If you want to apply this release, first save the file that is suitable for your system configuration, extract the .cab file, go to Device Manager, right click on the hardware device you wish to update, and choose \"Update Driver Software.\" Afterward, click on “Browse my computer for driver software,” navigate to and select the location of the new driver, hit “Next,” and follow all instructions displayed for a complete upgrade. Also, once finished, make sure to perform a reboot to allow the changes to take effect. In addition to that, besides the package spotted on Microsoft’s Update Catalog, the same driver version is also provided by Realtek. This particular file has been developed by Realtek along with Dolby to provide a better audio experience. As for compatibility, the downloadable archive is suitable for Windows 7, 8, 8.1, and 10 operating systems (including Windows 10 Threshold and Redstone anniversary editions), either 32- or 64-bit architectures. When it comes to installation, simply save and extract the driver, locate and run the setup file, and follow the instructions displayed. Last but not least, don’t forget to reboot your computer to allow the new version to start properly. That said, download Realtek HD Audio Driver 6.0.1.7977 , apply it on your system, and constantly check our website to be aware when a newer version is available.",

Most notably, the Windows 10 edition doesn't work with the Steam version , leaving players with ghost town servers and no one to play with.\nFingers have been pointed in the direction of Activision, which includes a Microsoft customer service rep, and multiple reports of refunds being granted. According to Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson noted that \"they support cross-play for partners who enable it,\" and that Activision opted to not provide that support.\nThis seems like a really odd  move since Infinite Warfare   isn't doing so hot on PC right now. If you're interested, I'd strongly consider getting it on consoles.\nCall of Duty Infinite Warfare is coming to the Windows 10 Store – with caveats [Windows Central]",

      "text": "by washingtonpondfrog For the life of me, I do not understand why Microsoft insists on making their Office products look and behave differently on Mac and Windows. My work computer is Windows and my home computer is Mac, and it is so painful going back and forth. Why aren’t there the same ribbon tabs on both? So confusing. Please, please, harmonize the experience across all platforms.There appears to be a ton of stuff missing on both the mac and web versions of OneNote, as compared to the Windows version. Most concerning to me is the ability to search for tags across all the notes. For instance, give me a rollup of all my unfinished to-dos. This search capability exists in the Windows version but is missing from both Mac and Web. I wanted to use this for project management and this tag searching is critical to me. It’s 2016 - I just don’t understand why they can’t get the programs to match better across platforms. I now have to look at different programs to see if something like Evernote can meet my needs. Learning and Organising Made Easy by VKVInd OneNote is not only a place to accumulate various documents relevant to the subject one is researching, but also helps avoid the clutter of hte internet by staying focussed within the app to progress !It is not merely a repository of knowledge, but a tool to keep refining and rearranging material as one gains subject knowledge or fluency in the topic.OneNote serves as a powerful study tool - essential to quickly move from being a novice at a topic to attaining competence - by gathering and reading/writing material relevant to the topic.Future books can be published from OneNote notebooks of actual users, with all the distilled knowledge, links and comments as is. Am sure they will effectviely compete with the current concept of formal books that aim to be clean, neat and sequenced into chapters. Unique styles of creating and curating material and arranging it in a unique way makes OneNote books like paintings - bearing individual styles for knowledge acquisition.OneNote also serves to access critical information across devices - a lifesaver for old personal data or articles from magazines that one may not find on the internet.This is a truly great, free tool from Microsoft ! College student with great notes! by Addictedd4eva OneNote is a great app. I love how you can type wherever you need to just in case you need to add things as a professor is speaking, or examples they say- its easily next to the notes it pertains to or wherever you want! super easy to edit and use. Only issue I have is if I want to print the pages I have to be very particular otherwise itll print with words like divided between 2 pages or something. Not sure if there is a print button that makes it print nicely on a page and I just havent found it yet or not, but if there is, it should be clearer as to where it is. Other than that I love this app and it is a great tool for taking notes or making lists or anything.",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nEven though there are plenty of phones that make it to the finish line and become available for purchase, there are others that remain in the shadows, never to see the light of day. Such a phone is Microsoft’s Lumia 750, which was supposed to occupy the space between the low-end Lumia 550 and the higher-end Lumia 950 and 950 XL , but was canceled before anyone could give it a chance. Now leaked images give us a glimpse of what might have been. \nAround front, the phone was rumored to feature a 5-inch, 1,280 x 720 resolution display, with a 5-megapixel selfie sensor and an 8MP main camera. Thanks to known device leaker Evan Blass, however, the first thing you will notice about the Lumia 750 is not the display or cameras, but its clean and colorful aesthetic . In terms of looks, it seems to be a combination of the Lumia 640 and Lumia 735, with the now-canceled phone possibly offered in multiple colors. \nMore: Microsoft to reportedly end sales of Lumia by end of year \nUnder the hood, Qualcomm’s quad-core Snapdragon 410 chipset and 1GB RAM were rumored to power the Lumia 750, with the meager 8GB of storage reportedly expandable through the MicroSD card slot. The 2,650mAh battery seems quite small, particularly when other phones include larger power packs, but thanks to the phone’s mid-range internals, it might have kept the Lumia 750 ticking from morning through the evening. \nFinally, the Lumia 750 might have run Windows 10 Mobile out of the box, but since the phone was in the works since 2015 , it might have also run Windows Phone 8.1. \nOverall, the Lumia 750 looks to have been a solid entrant in the mid-range phone space. The reasons surrounding its cancellation remain shrouded in mystery, though we assume they partly have to do with Microsoft reportedly doing away with the Lumia line and shifting resources to its rumored Surface Phone . Even then, Microsoft has quite the hill to climb, with the company’s mobile platform having captured less than one percent of the market. Also watch: Hands On: ZTE Axon 7",

It took Microsoft long enough to launch Microsoft Office on to Android properly, but since then the firm has been willing to experiment with new an interesting app designs for Android, ranging from Android Launchers, to a competitor for IFTTT. Now, however, they’re launching something a little more mundane into the Play Store, that doesn’t seem to be all that well received as of writing; the Microsoft Selfie app. \nAs you might expect, the Microsoft Selfie app is designed for those looking to take a photo and then make it a little better with some post-processing. As of writing, however, there doesn’t really appeal to be much in the way of added features that you’d find in another Selfie app out there. The main idea behind the Microsoft Selfie app is to use Microsoft’s own computer vision technology to take into account gender, skin color and age in order to put together an algorithm for the best adjustments to make your Selfie the best in can be. This, however, makes the app itself feel more like a tech demo than it does anything else, as the rest of the added filters and such are little more than added gimmicks if nothing else. They’re fairly basic and do little more than the built-in options on most phones do. \nOn top of that, the Microsoft Selfie app doesn’t actually feature its own camera, instead users are prompted to take a picture with the camera app on their phone and then edit it themselves, or choose something they’ve already taken. While this isn’t a deal break by any means, the whole app doesn’t quite feel like something you’d expect to see from Microsoft. Regardless, the app is free to download and those that want to take a look at the app can do so from the Play Store link down below.",

      "text": "Email \nIn time for Christmas \nWhile the UK is seeing price rises thanks to the falling pound, it seems that Microsoft is slashing the pricing of its Xbox One. \nVole is slashing its prices in the official UK store. You can pick one up for starting from £179.99. The reason for the cuts is because of the arrival of the more powerful Xbox One S and Project Scorpio is on the horizon. However the X-Box one is still worthwhile and this is a good discount if you want the console experience at an affordable price. \nGears of War, Quantum Break and Name Your Game bundles start from £179.99, alongside standalone consoles. These bundles also include a free game or two, depending on which you choose. The Elite console, Kinect, and The Division or Rainbow Six Siege packages cost £199.99 – still a good price for the console. This promotion is running until 2 December while stocks last.

      "text": "Microsoft Pix camera app updated with Live Image improvements, bug fixes Microsoft Pix camera app updated with Live Image improvements, bug fixes Posted: Tags : iOS - iOS + Microsoft - Microsoft + Apps - Apps + The intelligent camera app Microsoft Pix made its debut on the iOS platform back in July. Since then, the developers released quite a few updates that improved some of the app's existing features and even added more.The most recent update for Microsoft's Pix camera app brings some enhancements to the Live Image features, but also a few bug fixes for well-known issues. So, according to Microsoft, the Live Image's white balance has been improved to make it consistent with the captured photo. If you haven't taken advantage of the Live Image feature yet, you should know that it enables you to automatically create a short, looping video, bu stitching together the frames from the burst.Another tweak introduced in this update is the ability to perform crop, rotation, filter, and face enhancements at the same time and apply the changes only once. A more than welcome improvement for those who like to edit their images while on the move.As mentioned earlier, the update delivers some fixes as well. For example, Pix users will surely notice that the widget is now displayed correctly, whereas this wasn't possible in previous versions of the app.Also, Microsoft confirmed that it has addressed a certain issue that photo editing does not always show final cropped, rotated, or filtered image and face enhancement correctly.Microsoft Pix camera app version 1.0.21 has already been pushed to the App Store, so if have it installed on your iOS device you should check for the newest update.

      "text": "By Rich Woods Neowin LLC @@TheRichWoods · 45 minutes ago with 0 comments \nBack in August, Microsoft unveiled the Xbox Onesie , and it was glorious. The snuggly gaming suits were part of the Australian Xbox One S launch, but at the time, there appeared to be some hope that it might be available in other regions. \nMajor Nelson ended up giving some away , and more recently, Microsoft offered the ability to add a Onesie to your Xbox Live Avatar . In the announcement, Larry Hryb (Major Nelson) said that \"distribution was extremely limited and I was only able to give a handful of them away.\" \nSpeaking in the past tense, it implied that the Onesie was no longer available, so we reached out to Microsoft. A spokesperson issued the following statement to Neowin: \nThe Xbox Onesies were for a limited-time activation led by our Xbox Australia team and are no longer available at this time. \nAs you can see, the news does not look good for those who want to game in both style and comfort. Of course, nothing is ever written in stone. By offering the ability to add an Xbox Onesie to gamers' avatars, Microsoft clearly knows that there is some demand for the item, so there may be hope for the future. \n(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻",

      "text": "Tweet \nThe polls have shown a narrowing gap between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton in the race for the White House recently. After what seems like forever, in less than 24 hours we will finally find out who the next president of the United States will be. \nThere have been plenty of predictions made in the past month alone. An AI with a history of correctly predicting election winners claimed that Trump would take it , while Tinder -- yes, Tinder! -- predicted victory for Clinton , something Microsoft’s Bing Predicts agreed with . \nThree weeks ago, Bing Predicts gave Clinton an 87 percent chance of winning . The latest updated figures now suggest the democratic nominee has an 89 percent chance, putting Trump on just 10 percent. \nYou can see more here . \nIf you’re wondering how it will all unfold, Bing Predicts says that Clinton will secure 323 electoral college votes vs. Trump's 215. \nWe shall find out whether its predictions come to pass soon enough. You can follow the election results live on YouTube .",

      "text": "November 08, 2016 at 09:00 AM EST Ramp Partners with Syrinx Consulting to Provide Hands-on Expertise for Microsoft SharePoint(R) Video Deployments Across the Enterprise Addresses the need for secure video integrated with native SharePoint \nBOSTON, MA -- (Marketwired) -- 11/08/16 -- Ramp, the leading provider of next-generation SharePoint video management and eCDN video delivery solutions for large enterprises , today announced a technology and marketing partnership with Syrinx Consulting Corporation, whose software solutions keep pace with the changing state of business and technology. \nOn a daily basis, enterprises rely on live and on-demand video for training, executive communications, and marketing. The latest Microsoft SharePoint capabilities allow users to easily share video files in a SharePoint library or Yammer conversation. With increasing volumes of video content, managers need to securely and seamlessly manage video in the standard SharePoint environment. Through this partnership, Syrinx and Ramp will accelerate the delivery of high-quality solutions that manage video securely while delivering the best quality video experience for users in SharePoint. \n\"More enterprises are relying on SharePoint for their video content, so managers face the challenges of deploying high-quality video securely across the entire enterprise. With hands-on expertise in security and software design, Syrinx delivers full service, end-to-end enterprise projects, from concept through delivery, for SharePoint environments,\" said Tom Racca, CEO of Ramp. \nRamp VideoVerge for SharePoint uniquely combines self-service live webcasting and video management on a single, converged, cloud-based platform.

Importantly, Ramp overcomes the challenges of secure video management.\" \nAragon Research believes that video is poised for explosive growth in the enterprise, with video crossing over to become the dominant content type in 2018. According to Cisco, three-fourths of the world's mobile data traffic will be video by 2020. Mobile video will increase eleven-fold between 2015 and 2020, accounting for 75 percent of total mobile data traffic by the end of the forecast period. \nAbout Syrinx Syrinx Consulting is a developer-owned and run, custom software engineering firm with over 80 full-time engineers located in the United States.

      "text": "Microsoft Overhauls Its iPhone Camera App with Several Improvements GO Microsoft Pix receives new update on iOS Nov 8, 2016 13:57 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Microsoft Pix is Redmond’s own camera app for the iPhone, coming with features which the company guarantees will help users take better photos, so it’s no surprise that updates are released every once in a while for those on iOS devices. Today, for example, the company rolled out version 1.0.21, which comes with several improvements for iPhone users, including better support for live images. First and foremost, some background. Microsoft Pix is an application that was designed to automatically control some settings, and Redmond says that it can automatically adjust settings to help people look better in photos when faces are detected. It can also take photos in burst mode and then let you choose the best shot (pretty much like the majority of camera apps out there), but it also comes with options to refine colors, contrast, and brightness. What’s new in this new version? And version 1.0.21 pushes things one step further and improves live images white balance to make it consistent with the captured photo, as the company explains in the official changelog that was rolled out today in the App Store . Additionally, Microsoft explains that “when you edit an image, you can now perform crop/rotation/filter or face enhancement at the same time and apply the changes only once,” so the company has been working on improving the editing process of photos as well. Of course, this isn’t such a breaking change, but it’s good to see that Redmond is focusing on this side of the app as well. Obviously, there are some fixes as well in this version, and one of them concerns the photos editing which didn’t always show final cropped/rotated/filtered image and face enhancement correctly. Additionally, the widget should now be displayed correctly in iOS 10 (by the way, we’ve seen similar issues in many other iOS apps, so optimizations are needed the majority of developers who want a flawless widget on iOS). In the end, this update is clearly worth a look at by users who want to stick with Microsoft for their camera needs on iPhones, so make sure you download version 1.0.21 as soon as possible. ",

It can also take photos in burst mode and then let you choose the best shot (pretty much like the majority of camera apps out there), but it also comes with options to refine colors, contrast, and brightness. What’s new in this new version? And version 1.0.21 pushes things one step further and improves live images ...",

      "text": "Gears of War 4 review: A reboot done right \nWhile Microsoft is currently busy transitioning its Skype messaging service from a peer to peer infrastructure to a cloud-based one , the Skype team has announced today the launch of a new Skype Insider program. Just like the company’s Windows Insider and Office Insider programs, the new initiative will allow Skype enthusiasts to get access to preview releases and provide feedback to improve the messaging app: \nAs a Skype Insider, you can help us shape your Skype experiences as: You will have early access to Skype software and services updates and improvements. You will be able to give early feedback on these improvements and as well as help us iron out any quirks before we release them broadly. On top of that you will be able to submit your suggestions on what you would like to see in the Skype app in the future \nYou can join the Skype Insider Program right now by signing up online at the Skype Insiders Registration From and you’ll be given the choice to indicate the platform you want to sign up for. The Skype team notes that this program doesn’t include the Skype Preview UWP app for Windows 10 devices (Windows Insiders on the Fast Ring can already test preview builds of the messaging app) and that you’ll be able to install preview versions alongside the regular Skype app. \nThis announcement comes just a day after the Xbox team announced the rebranding of the Xbox Preview Program as the Xbox Insider Program and we applaud the company’s naming consistency. Sound off in the comments if you’re looking forward to see what’s next for the popular messaging app. In this story stream:",

      "text": "Project Scorpio E3 2016 reveal was a response to PS4 Pro leaks The PS4 Pro leaks forced Microsofts hand in unveiling Project Scorpio at E3 earlier this year, despite having previously only showed it to a few developers, according to this report. Windows Central is reporting that the constant PlayStation 4 Pro leaks, previously referred to as Neo, resulted in Microsofts decision to show Project Scorpio at E3 2016 back in June. Previously, the console was known only to a few select developers. Citing a credible source, the report goes on to talk about some of Microsofts plans for Scorpio. Scorpio will supposedly be able to run 4K UWP games available today on PC natively. 4K enabled versions of Gears of War 4 and Forza Horizon 3 are said to be among the top candidates. Developers will only need to make trivial changes to allow any UWP game to work on Scorpio. Natively here more than likely refers to how easy it presumably is to get Windows 10 UWP games to run on multiple platforms, and not native in the 4K resolution sense. On the development end, the report says Microsoft is planning to have all Scorpio development kits be a one-stop shop for all development on the platform. The kit will allow developers to test the game on different configurations, including an Xbox One-specific mode that mimics the current consoles performance. Games will be able to detect the hardware used to run them, and download the necessary a.ssets. Gwetn: The Witcher Card Game, Cuphead, and Everspace were cited as examples of how existing Windows 10 UWP games already support Scorpio, in a sense, just by virtue of being UWP apps. Theres more at the link, including a few snippets on Scorpios OS, and more.",

      "text": "By Andy Weir Senior News Editor Neowin LLC @gcaweir · 15 minutes ago \nShortly before the launch of its latest Xbox One S console , Microsoft cut the price of its older Xbox One to $249 in the United States, and £199 in the UK. While some deals occasionally popped up to reduce the cost of the console even further for British buyers, Microsoft itself has now cut the price of the original Xbox One to as little as £179.99. \nThe entry-level 500GB Xbox One is now available with two free games - Forza Horizon 3 and Halo 5: Guardians - for £179.99, but there are numerous other options to choose from. \nFor example, Microsoft has slashed £100 off its Xbox One Elite Bundle , which usually costs £299.99. The bundle includes a 1TB Xbox One, along with the Elite controller, and is now on sale for £199.99. Given that the Elite controller alone is priced at £119.99 , that effectively reduces the cost of the 1TB console to just £80 - quite a deal. \nOther discounted bundles include:",
