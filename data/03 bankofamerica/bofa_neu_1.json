      "text": "Order Reprint of this Story \nYour bank really wants to chat. \nRecently, Bank of America , MasterCard and several financial startups announced new tools – known as chatbots – that will allow customers to ask questions about their financial accounts, initiate transactions and get financial advice via text messages or services like Facebook Messenger and Amazon’s Echo tower. \nThe early versions of the financial chatbots generally do little more than answer basic queries about recent transactions and spending limits. \nBut companies are aiming to build the chatbots into full-service automated financial assistants that can make payments and keep track of your budget for you. \n“What will banking be in two, three or four years? It’s going to be this,” Michelle Moore, the head of digital banking at Charlotte-based Bank of America, said in describing the bank’s new offering, which it has named Erica. \nThe banks are looking to get in on the broader excitement about virtual assistants and chatbots in the technology industry. \nFacebook and Microsoft have introduced high-profile, occasionally problematic, chatbot features to capitalize on the popularity of messaging services, particularly among younger consumers. \nThese bots are generally powered by artificial intelligence software that lets them pull in information and turn it into comprehensible answers, in the way that Apple’s Siri attempts to do. \nMany companies are betting that automated bots – both in text messaging and voice-activated form – could become the dominant interface of the future, surpassing phone apps and websites as the way to reach consumers. \n“It’s pretty clear the tech industry thinks this is the next big thing,” said Tom Poole, the managing vice president of digital at Capital One. \nPoole’s firm rolled out its first voice-activated bot on Amazon’s Echo personal assistant system this year, and it is planning advanced capabilities in the coming months: “It’s just scratching the surface right now.” \nA few startups have already found success – and attracted attention from the banks – by creating chatbots that do particular financial tasks. \nDigit, a San Francisco-based startup, offers an iOS and Android mobile app that can monitor a customer’s spending habits and pull small amounts of money from a bank checking account into a Digit savings account several times a month – with all interactions channeled through text messages. The company has raised $36 million from venture capitalists and saved $230 million for its customers since starting in 2015. \nSaving is one of the features being built into Bank of America’s offering, Erica. The early version that the bank debuted last month can also track your credit score, look at your spending habits and offer advice on how to pay off bills, along with moving money. \nA day after Erica was unveiled at the financial technology conference Money 2020, MasterCard revealed its Kai offering, which it will make available to the banks that issue its cards. Neither Erica nor Kai is available to customers yet, and the companies did not provide firm release dates. \nAmong the Silicon Valley startups working in the same realm, there is a common argument that the new digital financial assistants should come from outside the financial firms so that they can link to any account a customer may have and bestow unbiased advice. \nBank of America, for instance, would have little incentive to suggest that its customers sign up for a credit card with another bank, even if it is offering a lower rate. \nSeveral venture capital firms have provided backing to a startup, Clarity Money, which was released last week and offers a range of services similar to Erica’s. \n“Consumers should have an unbiased advocate helping them navigate their financial lives,” said Adam Dell, the founder of Clarity and the brother of Dell Inc. founder Michael Dell. \nCritics of chatbots have said that even with artificial intelligence, bots will continue to lack the intuitive and empathetic understanding that humans need when dealing with difficult problems, such as financial decisions. \n“We all know the technology is not there yet,” said Josh Reich, the co-founder of Simple, an online bank that has not released any bot features. “It’s just people picking up on a hype cycle.” Related content",

      "text": "Marilyn Torres, Bank Of America, talks about opportunities at the job fair with Jossalberto Briceno, his wife Can Hui and son Wesley, 4 months. More than 1,000 veterans were expected on Thursday, November 10, 2016 to attend the Honor a Hero-Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair at the Warner Center Marriott. The fair, was hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance and the California Employment Development Department. (Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News,SCNG) \nWOODLAND HILLS >> Two weeks ago, U.S. Army Specialist Aisha Umar finished a three-year stint in the service and was worried about landing a civilian job.\nA day before Veterans Day, she and a thousand U.S. veterans got a hero’s welcome in Woodland Hills on Thursday at one of the largest veterans job fair in the state.\n“I feel welcomed. I feel honored. I wasn’t expecting this,” said Umar, 27, of Canoga Park, who hopes to return to USC and get a job as a statistical data analyst, gazing at nearly 100 prospective employers eager to hire vets.\n\n\n“When I got out two weeks ago, I didn’t think anyone would hire veterans.”\nThe 11th Honor a Hero — Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair drew an estimated 1,000 veterans from across the Southland to the Warner Center Marriott for a day of encouragement, support and greetings from California companies who hoped to hire them.\nThe job fair, hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance and the California Employment Development Department, paired vets with 91 companies with 3,200 available jobs.\nBy focusing on veterans, they hoped to give thanks to the many Americans who served. \n\n\nThey also hoped to whittle down a 7.8 percent unemployment rate for veterans across Los Angeles County, nearly double the national rate for vets. The jobless rate for the more than 28,000 employable veterans in the city of Los Angeles was even higher, at 9.6 percent, state employment officials said, \n“Events like these are a critical part of the Valley Economic Alliance’s effort to strengthen our economy, support our brave veterans and build a more innovative San Fernando Valley,” said Kenn Phillips, its president and CEO. \n\n\nThere were veterans who’d served during the Vietnam War, veterans who’d served during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and men and women who’d served in uniform in between.\nThey’d joined the service and had put off going to college, launching a career, starting a family and buying a home.\nNow they were ready to start new routines.\nBut since touching down in Hollywood Burbank Airport or a seaman’s landing in San Diego, CalVet officials say, many veterans have had trouble gaining civilian footing. Many need help with housing, education and, most importantly, jobs.\nAdvertisement \n\n“It’s been tough,” said Nick Johnson, 37, of Oxnard, a former Navy petty officer who served 11 years on a carrier or a destroyer, but left in July to be close to family. He has since struggled to find steady work. “A lot of places say they are veteran-friendly.\n“(But) I have had five to six interviews out of 80 applications. It’s not friendly.”\nThey streamed into the Marriott grand ballroom to be greeted by signs such as “Veterans are our friends” and lines of employer tables festooned with American flags.\n\n\n“Even at this time of low unemployment in this great country, we need to make sure that our veterans, those in particular that have served us in Afghanistan and Iraq, are welcomed with open arms,” said Patrick W. Henning Jr., director of the California Employment Development Department, during an opening ceremony. \nBefore it was over, Oxnard artist David SchwARTZ had unveiled an American flag-based canvas “Will to Live, Will to Serve” in honor of the late Cpl. Tibor “Ted” Rubin, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who was awarded the Medal of Honor a half century after his valor in Korea. The Garden Grove veteran died last December.\n\n\nOfficials said most U.S. veterans, many who have college degrees, have the right stuff for civilian jobs. They’re loyal, highly trained and employ leadership, discipline and teamwork. And they can roll up their sleeves with a strong work ethic.\nEach year, 25,000 veterans return home to California, home to 1.8 million other vets.\n“In over 28 years of military service, I have worked alongside soldiers, airmen and Marines performing honorably in the most arduous situations imaginable,” said Dr. Vito Imbasciani, secretary of the California Department of Veterans Affairs, a former Army surgeon who served four combat tours from Desert Storm to Iraq. “So I know firsthand that veterans are the best trained and qualified of those seeking employment.”\n\n\nDan Allan, an employment program manager for the state EDD office in Lancaster, attributed the soaring unemployment rates for veterans in Southern California to fierce competition for high-tech jobs.\nEmployers seeking to hire veterans Thursday ranged from Bank of America to the U.S. Forest Service.\n“Veterans, they gave so much to this country,” said Marc Jay, a recruiter for Aerojet Rocketdyne, a rocket engine maker in Canoga Park. “It’s time to give back.\n“I’ve already met some impressive people.”\nNearly two years ago, Aubrey Strain retired from Veterans Affairs after nearly four decades at the Sepulveda or West Los Angeles VA offices. Now the Air Force veteran who’d served during Vietnam has had to hit the bricks after family woes.\n\n\n“My wife got sick, so I have to go back to work — administration, delivery, anything,” said Strain, 60, of Van Nuys, in a crisp white shirt with French cuffs and links, ready to meet a new employer. “It feels OK.\n“I’m just glad to be alive. I appreciate those companies that help veterans.”\nClick here to subscribe to Digital & Home Delivery - 50% off About the Author \nReach the author at dana.bartholomew@dailynews.com or follow Dana on Twitter: @DN_DanaBart .\nFull bio and more articles by Dana Bartholomew Back to top",

      "text": "Marilyn Torres, Bank Of America, talks about opportunities at the job fair with Jossalberto Briceno, his wife Can Hui and son Wesley, 4 months. More than 1,000 veterans were expected on Thursday, November 10, 2016 to attend the Honor a Hero-Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair at the Warner Center Marriott. The fair, was hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance and the California Employment Development Department. (Photo by Dean Musgrove, Los Angeles Daily News,SCNG) \nWOODLAND HILLS >> Two weeks ago, U.S. Army Specialist Aisha Umar finished a three-year stint in the service and was worried about landing a civilian job.\nA day before Veterans Day, she and a thousand U.S. veterans got a hero’s welcome in Woodland Hills on Thursday at one of the largest veterans job fair in the state.\n“I feel welcomed. I feel honored. I wasn’t expecting this,” said Umar, 27, of Canoga Park, who hopes to return to USC and get a job as a statistical data analyst, gazing at nearly 100 prospective employers eager to hire vets.\n\n\n“When I got out two weeks ago, I didn’t think anyone would hire veterans.”\nThe 11th Honor a Hero — Hire a Vet Job and Resource Fair drew an estimated 1,000 veterans from across the Southland to the Warner Center Marriott for a day of encouragement, support and greetings from California companies who hoped to hire them.\nThe job fair, hosted by the Valley Economic Alliance and the California Employment Development Department, paired vets with 91 companies with 3,200 available jobs.\nBy focusing on veterans, they hoped to give thanks to the many Americans who served. \n\n\nThey also hoped to whittle down a 7.8 percent unemployment rate for veterans across Los Angeles County, nearly double the national rate for vets. The jobless rate for the more than 28,000 employable veterans in the city of Los Angeles was even higher, at 9.6 percent, state employment officials said, \n“Events like these are a critical part of the Valley Economic Alliance’s effort to strengthen our economy, support our brave veterans and build a more innovative San Fernando Valley,” said Kenn Phillips, its president and CEO. \n\n\nThere were veterans who’d served during the Vietnam War, veterans who’d served during recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq, and men and women who’d served in uniform in between.\nThey’d joined the service and had put off going to college, launching a career, starting a family and buying a home.\nNow they were ready to start new routines.\nBut since touching down in Hollywood Burbank Airport or a seaman’s landing in San Diego, CalVet officials say, many veterans have had trouble gaining civilian footing. Many need help with housing, education and, most importantly, jobs.\nAdvertisement \n\n“It’s been tough,” said Nick Johnson, 37, of Oxnard, a former Navy petty officer who served 11 years on a carrier or a destroyer, but left in July to be close to family. He has since struggled to find steady work. “A lot of places say they are veteran-friendly.\n“(But) I have had five to six interviews out of 80 applications. It’s not friendly.”\nThey streamed into the Marriott grand ballroom to be greeted by signs such as “Veterans are our friends” and lines of employer tables festooned with American flags.\n\n\n“Even at this time of low unemployment in this great country, we need to make sure that our veterans, those in particular that have served us in Afghanistan and Iraq, are welcomed with open arms,” said Patrick W. Henning Jr., director of the California Employment Development Department, during an opening ceremony. \nBefore it was over, Oxnard artist David SchwARTZ had unveiled an American flag-based canvas “Will to Live, Will to Serve” in honor of the late Cpl. Tibor “Ted” Rubin, a Hungarian-born Holocaust survivor who was awarded the Medal of Honor a half century after his valor in Korea. The Garden Grove veteran died last December.\n\n\nOfficials said most U.S. veterans, many who have college degrees, have the right stuff for civilian jobs. They’re loyal, highly trained and employ leadership, discipline and teamwork. And they can roll up their sleeves with a strong work ethic.\nEach year, 25,000 veterans return home to California, home to 1.8 million other vets.\n“In over 28 years of military service, I have worked alongside soldiers, airmen and Marines performing honorably in the most arduous situations imaginable,” said Dr. Vito Imbasciani, secretary of the California Department of Veterans Affairs, a former Army surgeon who served four combat tours from Desert Storm to Iraq. “So I know firsthand that veterans are the best trained and qualified of those seeking employment.”\n\n\nDan Allan, an employment program manager for the state EDD office in Lancaster, attributed the soaring unemployment rates for veterans in Southern California to fierce competition for high-tech jobs.\nEmployers seeking to hire veterans Thursday ranged from Bank of America to the U.S. Forest Service.\n“Veterans, they gave so much to this country,” said Marc Jay, a recruiter for Aerojet Rocketdyne, a rocket engine maker in Canoga Park. “It’s time to give back.\n“I’ve already met some impressive people.”\nNearly two years ago, Aubrey Strain retired from Veterans Affairs after nearly four decades at the Sepulveda or West Los Angeles VA offices. Now the Air Force veteran who’d served during Vietnam has had to hit the bricks after family woes.\n\n\n“My wife got sick, so I have to go back to work — administration, delivery, anything,” said Strain, 60, of Van Nuys, in a crisp white shirt with French cuffs and links, ready to meet a new employer. “It feels OK.\n“I’m just glad to be alive. I appreciate those companies that help veterans.”\n  About the Author \nReach the author at dana.bartholomew@dailynews.com or follow Dana on Twitter: @DN_DanaBart .\nFull bio and more articles by Dana Bartholomew Back to top",

      "text": "BAC has finally broken out. \nAnd it is out-performing most of the other banks. \nIt is all about interest-rates of course. \nBAC is the most sensitive large U.S. bank when it comes to interest rates. \nI am updating my target price for BAC. The phrase \"It's the economy, stupid\" was used very effectively during Bill Clinton's successful 1992 presidential campaign against,the then sitting president, George H. W. Bush. Mr. Bush was enjoying a 90% approval rating following the successful Gulf war as the 1991 recession began to take its toll - Mr Clinton certainly capitalized on on the economic downturn. Fast forward to November 2016 and it is a teary Bill Clinton watching Hilary painfully delivering a concession speech following her spectacular defeat to Donald J. Trump. Click to enlarge Trumpconomics Clearly very early days, but Trump's brand of supply-side economics (\"trumpconomics\") is certainly inflationary in nature - the expected cocktail mix of tax cuts, infrastructure spend and protectionism is pushing yields up. To be fair though, the reflation of the global economy started well before the election - as central bankers across the U.S., Europe and Japan, started to (loudly) question the efficacy of low to negative global interest rates. For Bank Of America (NYSE: BAC ), of course, it is all about the yield curve. BAC sensitivity to interest rates movement In its most recent 10-Q , BAC discloses its sensitivity to interest rates in the banking book: Click to enlarge As can be seen from above, a parallel move up of 100 basis points should increase BAC's annual pre-tax income by approximately $5.3 billion. The interesting point with BAC is that it is levered to both the short and the long end of interest rate curve. So even if assuming that the Fed will not move at all on the over-night rate, a shift of 100 basis points, at the long end, still results in over $2 billion of incremental pre-tax income. It is important to understand that BAC does not need to do anything else to earn this - it simply drops straight down to its bottom line. Or as Mike Mayo, the renowned CLSA analyst likes to describe it - Mr. Moynihan can simply afford to shine his shoes in the morning, come to work and wait for interest-rates to go up. And the bank will be absolutely fine. BAC outperforming U.S. peers BAC data by YCharts As opposed to JP Morgan (NYSE: JPM ) and Citigroup (NYSE: C ) - BAC business model is much more leveraged to the long-end of rates. As such, the outperformance is not hugely surprising given the sharp move in the 10 and 30 year Treasuries as of recent. Bank Of America Is Trading Like An Inverse 3X Leveraged ETF I have highlighted this in a prior article and of course I am referring to the Direxion Daily 20+ Year Treasury Bear 3x Shares ETF ( TMV ). The above chart says it all - long-term interest-rates are largely correlated with BAC's performance. The other HUGE reason why interest-rates matter for BAC Most investors typically visualise BAC's deposit-monster consumer franchise when thinking about interest rates differentials - and that is of course quite true, in essence banks borrow short and lend long to make money. Having said that, a much larger proportion of BAC equity capital is tied up in its Global Banking & Markets divisions (GB&M) - but make no mistake about it, a rising interest-rate environment is extremely conducive for bonds, currencies and rates trading businesses ( FICC ) as well. The increased level of trading by pension and mutual funds as they reposition their portfolios for a different macro settings as well as Corporates seeking to hedge interest-rates exposures should drive revenue significantly higher. FICC businesses' are to a large extent have a fixed cost operational model (IT, systems, Compliance) - as such, the increased trading revenues should deliver substantial positive operative leverage and increased profitability and return on capital. Some of it was already evident in Q3'2016 and the trend looks set to continue in the (traditionally somewhat) seasonally weaker Q4. Final thoughts My target price for BAC has been $19 and some change. Given the \"reflation\" of the global economy and interest-rates trajectory - I believe BAC can consistently earn above its cost of capital. As such, my revised price target is $24.

Here are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog: 5 Stocks to Buy as Trump Raises Hopes for Banking Sector Bank stocks, in recent years, have been held back by heavy regulation and low interest rates. But, optimism surrounding the sector’s outlook is growing, thanks to Donald Trump’s victory. Trump’s intention to roll back regulations and lower administrative burden will stand in good stead for the banking industry. Tax reforms and uptick in infrastructure outlays, then again, will spur a rate hike. There are other positives as well. Trading revenues will get a boost from heightened uncertainty surrounding Trump’s victory. Taking such positives into consideration, it will be prudent to invest in fundamentally sound banking companies. Roll Back Regulations Investors continue to turn toward banks as regulatory burden is likely to ease under Trump’s administration and Republican controlled congress. One such change will be the raising of the minimum asset threshold for banking behemoths to $250 billion from $50 billion, which will lend more flexibility, boost valuations, strengthen consolidation and increase lending. Regulations related to bank capital may be relaxed, with capital ratios for regional banks not expected to exceed 12%, while the ratio may be slightly higher for bigger lenders. Trump, in the meantime, views the Dodd-Frank regulatory overhaul as a harsh measure, especially, on smaller banks. Trump has called for repealing parts of the Dodd-Frank Act, which has for a considerable period of time limited operational flexibility. Trump’s team is also focusing on scaling back the Financial Stability Oversight Council, which serves as a watchdog on big players in the economy. They also want to fix a section of Dodd-Frank Title II that has given financial regulators the right to take over a failing financial firm and liquidate it. At the same time, the Trump administration is expected to embrace encouraging aspects of the law such as regulating derivative products and transparency of credit rating agencies. Tax Cuts, Rise in Spending Trump’s pledge to slash taxes and increase government spending will fuel inflation. Prices of bonds tanked as inflation mostly erodes the value of securities with a fixed-rate income stream. This in turn reached the 10-year treasury yield to its highest level since January. Higher longer-term interest rates can boost bank profits, as they increase the spread between what banks earn by funding longer-term assets, such as loans, with shorter-term liabilities. Trump called for sweeping reductions in personal income tax along with trimming the business tax rate from 35% to 15%. Corporates will also get a chance to repatriate foreign profits at a rate of 10%. Trump is in favor of beefing up public spending by hundreds of billions of dollars on infrastructure. He said that he will support more spending on transportation and telecommunications infrastructure, clean water and electricity transmission in order to accelerate economic growth. This in turn will create plenty of jobs in construction and manufacturing. In fact, he is expected to offer $137 billion in tax credits to private construction companies undertaking infrastructure projects. In his victory speech, Trump said, “We are going to fix our inner cities, and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We’re going to rebuild our infrastructure, and we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.” Heightened Volatility Boosts Trading There’s a lot of uncertainty about what a Trump presidency means for the U.S. economy over the medium and long term. Such uncertainty is expected to benefit banks by boosting its trading revenues from fixed income, currency and commodities segments. Gold prices are moving north, U.S. Treasury yields are leading a global bond rally while the Mexican peso registered a massive slump on Trump concerns. Trump’s win has hit Mexican assets hard after some of his pledges were viewed as a threat to the Mexican economy. Top 5 Bank Stocks to Buy Now Banks are poised to reap huge benefits from lighter regulations and rising interest rates under Trump’s presidency. The KBW Nasdaq Bank Index has gained 10% since the Election Day, while the value of stock and options held by six big bank CEOs have increased by a collective $159 million, according to Forbes.

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nA liberalization of Basel III capital requirements and key aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act would free vast amounts of capital for lending and multiply US banks’ profits. \nAmong these, the one most likely to profit from the new paradigm given its low level of gearing is Bank of America. \nProfits could potentially double during the next 5 years at BAC. Therefore, even after the recent stock price rise, the lender could be a very lucrative investment. US banking industry: the House always wins Trump's victory has raised waves in the US and abroad. His economic plans have not been formally outlined yet but from several sources it may be reasonably inferred. It seems the grand design consists on a Reaganian-like revival of tax cuts and debt funded economic stimulus, financial deregulations and maybe a reduction of military expenses abroad and subsequent budgetary transfers towards infrastructure investments within the US. We argued in our article \" Donald Trump's Victory Could Mean Exceptional News for US banks \" that the very likely most positively impacted sector by this set of measures would be US national commercial banks and Wall Street investment banks with major FICC practices. In a similar fashion, but in a different context, this has happened before. In 1981, Paul Volcker substantially increased interest rates from an average of 11.5% in 1979 to 21.5% in 1980 and 15.75% in 1981. This curbed the high inflation inherited from the Carter era -13.3% Consumer Price Index in 1979, 7.6% in 1981 and 4% in 1984. The move, combined with the enormous budget deficits of the Reagan era funded by debt and the subsequent boom in the US economy generated large profits for Wall Street houses and US major commercial banks. The impact on US banks' stock prices (JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM ), Goldman Sachs (NYSE: GS ) and Bank of America (NYSE: BAC )) of these policies is easily visualized in the chart below, which plots the stock price evolution for JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America between 1979 and 1990. Now once again, markets are sharing the cheer: As an early answer to Donald Trump's victory and alleged economic plan, with an increase of US KBW Banks Index till a maximum of 13.9% and major banks' individual increases of 18.5% for Bank of America, 14.8% for Wells Fargo and 16% for Goldman Sachs. And within the commercial banking space, it looks likely Bank of America will be the top winner of the Trumpnomics to come soon. De-regulation and investment stimulus According to Stephen Moore, one of Trump's economic advisors \"This is going to be a president who will be the biggest regulatory reformer since Ronald Reagan.\" The consensus in Washington and Wall Street is that deregulation will be focused on banking, healthcare and energy industries. In the financial sector, Trump could combine deregulation of the most problematic aspects of the Dodd-Frank Act with the liberalization of capital and liquidity requirements for commercial and investment banks set in the Basel III banking regulation framework; of particular interest would be a reform of RWAs capital requirements and financial stability ratios Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). In order to reach that goal, the new president would need the collaboration of the Congress. Basel III is a voluntary international agreement negotiated multilaterally that must afterwards be implemented into national (or Pan European in case of the European Union) legislations through internal legal acts. In the US, the legal regulatory hierarchy for Basel III and other banking regulatory rules is: 1) Federal statutes and legislative mandates authorizing the federal banking agencies to establish minimum capital requirements, capital adequacy standards and safety and soundness standards. 2) Regulations and reporting requirements established by the Fed following the allowance of a federal law. 3) interpretations and supervisory guidance issued by the Fed. Most of the Basel III requirements were implemented by the \"Final Rule\" of the Fed on July the 2nd 2013 following authorization by Federal legislation and taking into account certain modifications which the Dodd-Frank Rule forced them to introduce. Therefore, a liberalization of capital requirements, risk-weighted assets' definitions and the general prudential requirements already implemented by the US regulator could be on the table, and it would be easy to implement through legislation passed by the Congress on the initiative of the Presidency. Once enacted by the Congress, the Fed would be forced to implement the amendments linking them or not, and we should not forget that Janet Yellen's term ends in 2018 and it is a Presidential prerogative to appoint the next Fed chairman. These modifications, combined with the redesign of some of the most controversial elements of the Dodd-Frank Act, such as the prohibition of proprietary trading of US lenders or the weakening of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, would free vast amounts of capital for lending, generate a financial boom for several years and give US banks a big advantage compared with European or Japanese counterparts - at least for a while. These dynamics, endogenous to the banking system, when combined with an external positive shock (i.e. the stimulus package calculated at circa £1tn in infrastructure expending financed by tax cuts and the subsequent GDP extra growth boom) would multiply the demand for financial intermediation in the US and therefore, profits and return on equity for US megabanks. And among these, the most likely to profit from this situation would be Bank of America. BAC design: the best for Trumpnomics Bank of America's interest rate structure and operational leverage are the most geared among big US commercial banks to an interest rate recovery and a potential liberalization of capital requirements by the new Donald Trump government. It is difficult to standardize between different interest rates' sensitivity information provided by US banks in their 10-Q quarterly reports but with some basic assumptions, we can infer safely that Bank of America owns the most exposed yield portfolio to increases in interest rates in the US. For a 100bps increase in interest rates, Bank of America would increase its pre-tax earnings in approx. $5.3bn compared with circa $2.5bn for Wells Fargo and $2.8bn for JPMorgan Chase. BAC is as well the best-positioned financial institution for a \"sweetening\" of capital requirements and risk limits established in the Basel III framework. In terms of pure equity, it is the least leveraged bank in the US with an assets to equity ratio of 8.1 compared with 9.5 times at Wells Fargo, 9.4 times at US Bancorp and 9.9 times at JPMorgan. If we look at a more detailed risk measure, Bank of America is again the lender with the lowest ratio RWAs/Equity, at 5.1 times compared with 6.4 for Wells Fargo, 7.4 for US Bancorp and 5.7 for JPMorgan Chase, Finally, in terms of capability to increase lending, again Bank of America is top of the league: Its loan to deposits ratio is 72.4%, compared with 75% from Wells Fargo and 78% for US Bancorp. The potential to expand credit to clients is thus very significant, particularly if the Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) and the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) are liberalized. This would give an underleveraged player such as Bank of America even more space for gearing; the cost would be higher balance sheet instability in the long term. Stock price and the future In terms of stock price, even after the 18% increase suddenly experienced, the stock is very cheap given its potential upside: BAC is quoted at 14 times Price Earnings 0.81 times price book value. The potential for earnings to improve is huge: Return on Assets (ROA) is very low in historic terms, at around 0.9% and its M&A strategy in the immense US retail banking market gives BAC a big scope for balance sheet increase (See Article: Band of America, best US long in a generation... despite the Regulator ). Taking into account 1) each 200bps, a reasonable outcome in the context of rising interest rates due to an investment boom funded by debt could increase Bank of America's yearly profits by 49%, 2) the potential of its FICC and equities franchise to thrive with less capital requirements and only minor business restrictions and 3) the upside of a booming economy for both the commercial and investment banking sides of the business, Bank of America is the best way to play Trumpnomics in the US over the next 3-5 years. Therefore, a long position should be very lucrative for a prudent banks investor… but beware afterwards. Once the upside is reached, it will be advisable to keep in mind the words of Paul Volcker at \" American Banker\" published the 12th March 1987 : \n\"In concept, we could shut off the flow of imports by aggressive, broad brush protectionist measures. But the result would be to drive up the rate of inflation and interest rates-here, to damage growth abroad, and to invite retaliation. Instead of sustained and orderly growth, we would invite world-wide recession. \nWe could try to drive the dollar much lower - or complacently sit back while the market forces produce that result. But that too would undermine the hard-won gains against inflation, and would risk dissipating the flow of foreign capital we, for the time being, need. The stability of financial markets would be jeopardized, and export prospects could be undercut by adverse effects on growth abroad\" Disclosure: I/we have no positions in any stocks mentioned, and no plans to initiate any positions within the next 72 hours.

      "text": "There will be another recession. The only question is when. Bank of America warns one could start as soon as next year. Colorado’s most recent revenue report includes a section entitled “ Predicting the Next Recession .” Arizona’s legislative economists are worried about one coming in the next two years . But no state has built a recession into their budget forecast yet. And they may not be prepared for one.\nOnly 23 states and the District of Columbia (DC) had higher per capita real Gross Domestic Product in 2014 than when the national economy’s peaked in 2007. And due to various combinations of slow economic growth, legislated tax cuts, and a collapse in energy prices, overall state tax revenues remain below historic averages and have not recovered pre-recession peaks in about half of the states.\nAnd the trend is likely to continue: Median growth of nominal state general fund revenues over the next few years is expected to be about 3.5 percent. Several states are struggling to pay for current levels of government services, much less greater needs due to demographic changes or likely cuts in real federal spending.\nRecommended: Tax dodging quiz: What's legal and what's not? How will states manage? The most effective way for state governments to weather a recession is by building up their rainy day funds. Ideally states would add to these reserve funds in fat years so they can maintain critical services in lean ones. These funds helped states weather the 2001 economic slump, but the Great Recession of 2007-2009 overwhelmed the reserves, leaving most state rainy day funds drained.\nTest your knowledge Tax dodging quiz: What's legal and what's not? Photos of the Day Photos of the Weekend Back in the day, the rule-of-thumb suggested states bank 5 percent of their annual operating expenditures. But ratings agencies now demand more and the Government Finance Officers Association recommends about 15 percent. Only 10 states are estimated to have met this goal in 2016.\nThese rules are a good starting point but each state has its own advantages and obstacles. Energy states may want larger reserves because their revenue is so volatile. Ditto for states heavily reliant on income taxes especially given the volatility of capital gains. States may also be vulnerable to a changing federal tax environment.\nRecent history is instructive. By 2000, states had built up a combined 10.4 percent of their expenditures in year-end balances and rainy day funds, according to the National Association of State Budget Officers (NASBO). Forty states reported a balance of at least 5 percent and 23 had more than 10 percent saved up. By the time the recession of the early ‘90s ended in fiscal year 2004, total balances had fallen to 3.2 percent and only 12 states had reserves over 5 percent. Because those balances helped states through the recession, several additional states enacted rainy day funds.\nBy 2007, states had rebuilt their cumulative fund balances to 10.1 percent. And 33 had balances over 10 percent (10 more than 2000) until they cratered in the Great Recession. After the recovery, 11 states had restored their balances to more than 10 percent but the cumulative balance among all states was only about 7 percent. That number, however, was somewhat misleading because two states-- Alaska and Texas—had built up enormous reserves thanks to strong energy related revenues. Without these two states, fund balances were 4.5 percent of expenditures in 2011, less than half the level of 2007.\nNASBO’s Spring 2016 survey reports that by last year total state balances had been rebuilt to more than 10 percent (7.5 percent excluding Alaska and Texas). In 2016, it is expected to fall to 8.9 percent in large part because Alaska had to take about $3 billion from reserves to shore up spending in the face of collapsing oil prices.\nMore troubling, the number of states with reserves over 10 percent fell from 21 states in 2015 to 17 in 2016 and is expected to fall to 13 in 2017. This is not a good trend, especially when combined with forecasts of anemic state revenue growth despite economic growth.\nThis article first appeared in TaxVox .",

      "title": "Bank Of America In December: How High Can It Go?",
      "text": "Summary \nNow is a rather safe time to buy Bank of America (BAC), from a risk/reward perspective. \nWith BAC’s December being a traditionally strong month, the BAC rally could be pushed higher. \nOnce BAC clears itself as a debt liability, investors will regret not having bought at $20. At the end of last year, when Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) was seeing falling return on equity (ROE), I was saying the stock was still undervalued . My timing was right-on: BAC got itself together and pumped ROE up to relative highs: Yet the stock still fell into early 2016. Now, with the Trump factor, we are seeing 52-week highs. The author of the Trump factor article asked whether BAC stock still has room or whether we should treat the $20 price level as the base level. I believe I can answer that question. But first, let's shrink our time horizon for a second and look at the current state of BAC: Click to enlarge BAC is a sideways-trender, which makes it popular among conservative dividend seekers. The overbought signal we see in the stochastics does not always predict a pullback in the stock, as you can see from last month. However, this signal should be heeded, at least; wait for the \"overbought\" status to die out before considering adding to your position. We see the options being fairly valued for once, with statistical volatility equally implied volatility. The options market was going crazy for a while - especially with call buying - but much of that excitement has died down. Calls still outnumber puts at the moment, and I see this as the rather common indication of when speculators attempt to push a rally to continue. A continued rally is justified from my calculations. The excess returns model (ERM), which is the most logical model with which to value a bank stock, shows BAC at around $8 undervalued still: I'll be able to update the model soon, when BAC reports its FQ4 earnings. But for now, notice the upward trend that began in 2013. Typically, these trends last for a number of years or until interest rate policies change. Because the ERM model incorporates ROE, we can assume that the valuation for early 2016 will be higher. Please note that if you are to value BAC in a different way, you will get wild and strange valuations. For example, a free-cash-flow predictive model puts BAC's valuation at $2.5 a share - something that is illogical when you consider that BAC's book value is $24 per share. But BAC is still trading below both its ERM value and its book value. This tells us that investors are still quite negative toward the stock. As I've stated in previous articles, bank stocks are notoriously undervalued - most of them, anyway - because of the bad taste they left in investors' mouths during the 2008 fiasco. Bank stocks are not glamorous by any measure of the word, but they are repeating a situation akin to the tech undervaluation after 2000. Retrospectively, tech stocks would have been great buys right after the 2000 crash, but it's hard to buy when everyone around you is bearish toward that sector, financial valuations be damned. Negative sentiment stifles investors from making logical decisions - decisions that ultimately lead to a positive alpha. My ERM analysis implies BAC still has 40% upside. Biting the bullet and biting when sentiment is negative is hard but profitable. We see what happens when sentiment alone changes slightly with the company's underlying fundamentals unchanged: a 25% rally in the latest case. While the bank industry has seen earnings declines, BAC is still growing: With BAC having regained its profitability in 2012, growing that profitability ever since, the market has nevertheless determined a \"sentiment top\" for BAC, which was only recently broken due to a presidential election. December might not bring a rate hike but it is a rather safe time to buy BAC, from a risk/reward perspective: With BAC's December being a traditionally strong month, the only thing holding BAC from growing more is the illogical idea that \"it's too expensive.\" However, debt and equity are closing in: Click to enlarge Once BAC clears itself as a debt liability, investors will look back at an \"expensive\" $20 BAC stock and regret not buying. I don't think a $30 BAC in 2017 is wishful thinking. To me, \"wishful thinking\" is better exemplified by the analysts who were quiet during BAC's decline yet have now opened their mouths to state that the recent rally has no basis. Cognitive dissonance at its finest. We might be looking at BAC's upcoming FQ4 earnings report in Exposing Earnings, if that earnings analysis garners enough interest.

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nThe Federal Reserve is expected to increase rates in December 2016, and this will be a significant catalyst for BAC. \nThere is another catalyst that will create a tremendous amount of shareholder value through 2018. \nBAC is a long-term buy below $23/share. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) is in a position to create a tremendous amount of shareholder value over the next few years, and BAC shareholders have already started to be rewarded for holding onto shares through the 2016 roller coaster ride (see graph below). The bank's stock price, along with the stock prices of most other financial institutions, has shot up in a straight line since Mr. Donald J. Trump was elected earlier this month to be our next president. Click to enlarge (Source: Yahoo! Finance --edited by author) However, investors should not expect for BAC's stock price to \"come back to reality\" anytime soon, because, as IP Research described in this recent article , there are several key themes in place --rising rate environment, business-friendly tax changes, positive regulatory changes --that will give BAC the opportunity to greatly improve its earnings potential in the near future. Investors keep highlighting the increasing expectations of a December interest rate hike, and rightfully so, as the bank previously communicated that a 100bps shift in the interest rate yield curve would translate into ~$5b more in annual earnings, but, in opinion, BAC is a long-term buy with or without a December hike. The Story Was Already Intact As I described in \" BAC: Investors Will Be Rewarded For Playing The Waiting Game \" , a slight change in investor sentiment had the potential to materially move BAC's stock price higher. This is exactly what happened in early November when the financial community had the chance to consider what a Republican sweep and a Trump presidency would mean for BAC (and the economy). Well before November 2016, BAC shares were trading at a steep discount to the bank's book value (and tangible book value) and the negative impacts of the Financial Crisis (i.e. legal fines and settlements) were already started to fade, so the bank's \" long-term story \" has been intact for at least the last two years. BAC has reported lumpy earnings since 2011, but more recently the bank has started to reap the benefits of management's plan to create a more-efficient bank. Click to enlarge (Source: BAC's 2015 10-K --edited by author ) Moreover, BAC was able to reduce noninterest expenses by 3% from Q3 2015 to Q3 2016. The 3% YoY decline in noninterest expenses may not seem like much but let's not forget that this reduction is after BAC has already been able to materially reduce expenses over the past five years. 2015",

      "text": "Source: Bank of America Earnings Presentation Business Analysis When current CEO Brian Moynihan took over in 2010, Bank of America was a catastrophe. Under previous CEO Ken Lewis, the bank acquired both Countrywide Financial (the home mortgage originator) and Merrill Lynch; two decisions that Morningstar's senior banking analyst Jim Senegal dubbed \"some of the worst capital allocations decisions of all time.\" Mr. Senegal isn't being hyperbolic, as Countrywide and Merrill Lynch ended up exposing Bank of America to over $200 billion in legal fines, compliance fees, and enough exposure to toxic debt that it nearly bankrupted the company. Fortunately, Brian Moynihan is a completely different banker than Ken Lewis (who was a huge fan of risky speculation in highly leveraged mortgage-backed security derivatives and credit default swaps), who has spent his tenure laser focused on creating a far more conservative banking culture. This can be seen through three major initiatives: First, Moynihan sold off much of the bank's underperforming business segments to focus on the bank's core businesses, which allowed for massive cost cuts. However, unlike many banking rivals, Bank of America has spent the last six years trying to build a permanently leaner corporate culture, as seen with management's ongoing $3.3 billion in annual cost savings the bank is targeting by the end of 2018. Even more importantly, after the trauma the entire banking industry experienced in 2008, Bank of America has focused on creating a fortress-like balance sheet, one strong enough to withstand an economic shock even worse than the Great Recession. As you can see, Bank of America's Basel III common equity Tier 1 capital ratio (the most conservative form of comparing a company's working capital to its risk-weighted assets) has been steadily climbing over the years. In fact, since 2010, under Moynihan's leadership the ratio has risen 55.2% from 7.6% (very weak balance sheet) to 11.8%. Source: Bank of America Earnings Presentation Current Federal regulations dictate a minimum of 8% to ensure a bank can remain solvent (and avoid needing a federal bailout) even during an economic shock. In order for a bank to be allowed to return capital to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, a bank needs to prove that doing so won't result in its reserve capital being too weak to survive a worst case economic scenario. The scenario that was tested most recently modeled a far more severe and prolonged recession than what we experienced in 2008-2009 (when GDP declined peak to trough by just 5.3% and unemployment peaked at 10.0%). Bank of America passed this year's stress test with flying colors. In fact, the bank even managed to meet the minimum 8.0% CET1 ratio minimum, which indicates that it could have continued to pay its current dividend during the hypothetical economic turmoil. In other words, management deserves a lot of credit for managing to turn one of America's shakiest and unwieldy banks into a company that can likely stand up to a potential mini-depression without government support. That's thanks to the most important changes that Mr. Moynihan has brought to Bank of America, a relentless focus on high credit quality and disciplined loan underwriting. Bank Of America has been steadily growing its loan book while maintaining strict credit quality (as seen with its declining net charge-off ratio below) rather than attempting to grab faster growth via extending credit to subprime borrowers shows that management is serious about transforming the corporate culture at the company. In fact, UBS (NYSE: UBS ) analyst Brennan Hawken recently stated after its most recent earnings results that Bank of America was fast becoming \"the most conservative large bank.\" While Mr. Hawken believes that this pivot to ultra conservative banking could leave a lot of profit on the table, personally as a long-term dividend growth investors I applaud Bank Of America for attempting to mimic Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC ) and JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM ) in growing long-term shareholder value the right way - slow and steady. This is especially true when you look at the bank's exceptional growth in this time of severely low interest rates, which makes it hard for banks to earn substantial returns on their loans. When it comes to all the metrics that matter for long-term investors, including EPS growth, the dividend payout ratio, the dividend itself, the efficiency ratio (what proportion of revenue go to operating the bank), the Tier 1 capital ratio, and net interest margin, Bank of America is making good progress (see table below). This is especially visible in its growth in book value per share, which is the best objective measure for a bank's intrinsic value. Specifically, the company has been steadily growing its book value despite the challenging market conditions in the banking industry, and thus setting itself up for potentially much stronger capital gains going forward (when its P/TBV multiple might expand). Click to enlarge Source: Bank of America Earnings Release Key Risks While there seem to be some reasons to be cautiously optimistic about Bank of America's long-term growth prospects, there are two main risks investors need to keep in mind. First, Bank of America's non-performing commercial loan ratio has been rising in recent quarters. While this hasn't yet shown up in its net charge-off ratio, it could be a troubling sign that the credit cycle is turning. Specifically, recent changes in U.S. regulations pertaining to money market funds that went into effect October 14th have caused the short-term LIBOR, or London Interbank Offer Rate, to rise sharply in recent months. Click to enlarge The new regulations are designed to safeguard money market funds by raising liquidity requirements for these short-term investment funds, which make up the backbone of the massive commercial paper market. Commercial paper are short-term (270 days or less), unsecured loans that make up the oil that greases the corporate world. Companies tap this market to ensure adequate liquidity to pay customers, as well as employees. So the concern is that this increase in LIBOR will result in a contraction (i.e. higher borrowing costs) that might hurt companies and threaten the still weak economic recovery. That's especially true now that interest rates are rising in anticipation of a Trump administration stimulus plan, which could combine large increases in infrastructure spending, as well as tax cuts and deregulation. Basically, these factors could spur short-term economic growth at a time when the labor market is close to full employment, resulting in higher wages (great news for consumers) but also potentially higher inflation. That in turn could force the Federal Reserve to increase interest rates faster than it had planned, which could potentially bring about the next recession. While higher interest rates generally improve the profitability of banks' lending operations, a recession wreaks havoc as customers struggle to repay their loans. This brings me to the second major risk, which is the rumored roll-back of certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank regulations passed after the financial crisis. While we have yet to see any specifics, rumors are that we could see lower capital requirements (allowing banks to move cash from low risk, low yield treasuries to higher risk, higher-yielding loans), as well as end the Fed's annual review of a bank's capital plans, including how much profit can be returned to shareholders as buybacks and dividends. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying that should such regulatory changes happen that Bank of America would suddenly revert back to its highly speculative and dangerous gambling ways of the past. After all, management has gone to great lengths to raise its capital ratios far above the regulatory minimums in the name of maximizing the safety of the bank's shares. However, in the event that Mr. Moynihan was to retire, my concern would be whether or not the conservative changes he made at this world spanning bank would stick. It's always possible that rising complacency among short-term investors calling for faster earnings growth and faster capital returns could lead a new management team to potentially weaken the bank's balance sheet to \"just good enough to survive another downturn.\" If the financial crisis proved anything, it's that erring on the side of caution is always best. After all, the history of banking and investment management has shown us that models can easily fail, and that \"once in a century\" or even \"impossible\" events can occur with frighteningly high frequency. Dividend Safety Analysis: Bank of America We analyze 25+ years of dividend data and 10+ years of fundamental data to understand the safety and growth prospects of a dividend. Our Dividend Safety Score answers the question, \"Is the current dividend payment safe?\" We look at some of the most important financial factors such as current and historical EPS and FCF payout ratios, debt levels, free cash flow generation, industry cyclicality, ROIC trends, and more. Dividend Safety Scores range from 0 to 100, and conservative dividend investors should stick with firms that score at least 60. Since tracking the data, companies cutting their dividends had an average Dividend Safety Score below 20 at the time of their dividend reduction announcements. Click to enlarge We wrote a detailed analysis reviewing how Dividend Safety Scores are calculated, what their track record has been, and how to use them for your portfolio here . Bank of America has a Dividend Safety Score of 49, suggesting that the company's dividend is reasonably secure and about as safe as the average dividend stock in the market. How is it that a bank with such a strong balance sheet and low payout ratio has merely average dividend security? The answer lies in the nature of the banking industry itself. Source: Simply Safe Dividends As you can see, bank earnings can be highly cyclical thanks to periodic financial crashes that can result in massive earnings per share collapses. In the case of Bank of America, this can be even more extreme, with the bank's earnings per share swinging from $3.29 in 2007 to a loss of -$0.37 in 2010. Click to enlarge Source: Motley Fool This kind of extreme profit swings, combined with constant regulatory risks (such as calls to break up big banks), as well as having to OK dividends with regulators, means that banking dividend safety isn't as cut and dry as merely looking at a bank's payout ratio. Remember that the business model of a bank is to have a highly levered balance sheet (even with today's fortress-like balance sheet), which means that during an economic downturn losses can be magnified and force a bank to cut its dividend even if the payout remains technically sustainable. We saw this in 2008-2009 when regulators forced Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase, who sailed through the financial crisis intact and still profitable, to cut their dividends \"just in case\" the cash might be needed had the economic collapse proven worse than it did. Dividend Growth Analysis Our Dividend Growth Score answers the question, \"How fast is the dividend likely to grow?\" It considers many of the same fundamental factors as the Safety Score but places more weight on growth-centric metrics like sales and earnings growth and payout ratios. Scores of 50 are average, 75 or higher is very good, and 25 or lower is considered weak. Bank of America has a Dividend Growth Score of 44, indicating potential for solid dividend growth going forward, but also serving as a reminder that the banking industry can be extremely volatile and even the safest banks can sometimes have to cut their dividends. For example, while Bank of America's immense improvements to its business model, balance sheet safety, and profitability over the past six years have resulted in impressive dividend growth, including its most recent 50% payout hike, the fact is that we still don't know how the bank will fare when the next economic downturn hits. That's not to say that a recession is necessarily imminent. In fact, based on the most recent economic data, the Atlanta Federal Reserve's GDPNow model is forecasting brisk 3.6% Q3 economic growth. If this model proves accurate and U.S. economic growth does improve in the coming quarters, then the Federal Reserve will likely raise interest rates. Which combined with the already strong increase in long-term rates (as represented by rising 10 and 30-year US Treasury rates), could spell a bonanza for Bank Of America. After all, of all the big U.S. banks, it's most set to profit from even minor increases in rates. For example, if interest rates rise by just 1%, Bank of America projects that its annual profit would soar by almost $7.5 billion. Or to put it another way, if the Federal Reserve's long-term forecast for interest rates is correct (2.5% increase by 2020), Bank of America is poised to potentially see its annual profits soar by $18.7 billion; an 118% increase compared to 2015. And that's just assuming the bank's current assets stay the same. In reality, a scenario in which interest rates rise steadily for years would likely mean strong economic growth that would see the bank's assets grow substantially as well. Since the bank has been aggressively buying back shares and plans to only accelerate share reductions going forward, the growth in EPS would be even more impressive. Which in turn could theoretically drive the payout ratio to even low levels based on today's dividend and allow for some of the best dividend growth in corporate America over the next five years, potentially along the order of 15% to 20% per year. Of course, this all assumes that the economy continues to recover and interest rates continue to rise. Since no one can accurately predict either factor, Bank of America's potential to become America's best dividend growth stocks remains highly speculative. Valuation When it comes to bank valuations, price to tangible book value (i.e. \"liquidation value\") is the gold standard metric to use. That's because this compares the current valuation to the objective intrinsic value of the bank, and by comparing this metric to its historic norm, as well as those of its peers, we can get a sense for the quality of the bank itself.

      "text": "A cursory glance at Bank of America’s stock chart reveals two facts: First, BAC stock is now in a rousing weekly uptrend. Second, it is insanely overbought in the short-run. \nBecause of the latter fact, would-be buyers have been sending prayers for a pullback to the market gods for days now. Thus far, answers have been absent and spectators have been relegated to either chasing BofA shares or watching the profit-fest from afar. \nI suspect, however, patience will finally pay this week. Profit-taking has seized Bank of America stock in early morning trading Monday, so here’s to hoping sellers can cobble together a multi-day downturn. \nIn light of the epic weekly breakout scored during the post-election buying frenzy, any and all dips in financial stocks demand to be bought. \nThat brings us to today’s tantalizing trade in BAC stock. A Naked Put for BAC Stock Buyers \nOne of the beauties of the options market is the ease with which traders can reduce their stock purchase price. Stock traders looking to buy at a discount typically use limit orders. \nFor example, if you’re a willing buyer on a dip to $20, you could place a buy limit at $20. If the stock never drops to $20, you won’t have to buy. If shares do drop to $20, you get to grab them at a small discount from the current price. \nWith options, we can take it a step further by getting paid for our willingness to buy BAC stock at a discount. By selling the Jan $20 put option. you promise to buy 100 shares (per contract) at $20 if the stock sits below that price at expiration. But since you receive around 60 cents right now for selling the put, your effective purchase price would be $19.40. \nAnd, bonus, if the stock ends up above $20 at expiration the put will expire worthless allowing you to pocket the $60 of premium (60 cents x 100). \nBottom line: If you want to get paid for your willingness to buy BAC stock at around $19.40, sell the Jan $20 puts. \nAs of this writing, Tyler Craig did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities. \nArticle printed from InvestorPlace Media, http://investorplace.com/2016/11/buy-bank-of-america-corp-bac-stock-cheap-iplace/. \n©2016 InvestorPlace Media, LLC",

      "text": "Bank of America Series E (BAC-E) $22.18 3 Month LIBOR + 0.35% or 4% 4.5% Bank of America Series 1 (BML-G) $19.98 3 Month LIBOR + 0.75% or 3% 3.8% Bank of America Series 2 (BML-H) $19.75 3 Month LIBOR + 0.65% or 3% 3.8% Bank of America Series 4 (BML-J) $22.47 3 Month LIBOR + 0.75% or 4% 4.5% Bank of America Series 5 (BML-L) $22.27 3 Month LIBOR + 0.50% or 4% 4.5% Click to enlarge Unfortunately for holders of these preferreds, the floating rate preferreds have also been under pressure as interest rates have moved higher but not enough to trigger the floating provision. The current three month LIBOR has more than doubled off its 52 week low but still sits at less than 1%. To begin triggering the floating rate provision on any of these preferreds the three month LIBOR would need to move above 2.25%. If interest rates are slow to move higher even the floating rate preferreds could still be under pressure since it could be years before the LIBOR rate moves high enough for the preferreds to benefit. However, as the LIBOR rate closes in on the level where it would trigger a higher dividend the floating rate preferreds are likely to stabilize and may begin rising in anticipation of a higher dividend. It should be noted that the floating rate preferreds have all past their call dates meaning Bank of America can call them at their liquidation value at any time. While this does limit upside for investors, the current discount to liquidation value means that investors buying today would still see double-digit returns in the event of a call. Fixed-rate preferreds Since higher rates have moved back into the news, fixed-rate preferreds have not surprisingly been under pressure. With yields in the 6% range these preferreds may look attractive initially but have the potential for further downside if interest rates march higher. But investors interested in the yields of the fixed-rate preferreds do have one option that has some built-in hedging. Bank of America Series L (BAC-L) pays a similar yield to the other preferreds but can be converted into common stock. But since it only converts into 20 shares, common shares would need to reach $59.25 for holders of Series L to break-even through a conversion. While higher interest rates are likely to push the common shares higher it could be years before shares reach the conversion levels. Because of this, the conversion feature is a long-term option on a rising Bank of America common stock price. Additionally, Series L cannot be called by Bank of America unless the common share price hits $65 which would result in about a 10% gain for investors at today's prices. This provision prevents investors from losing the current premium as the result of a call which is a risk factor in several other series of Bank of America preferreds. Takeaway Common stock is the most direct way to get exposure to higher interest rates within the Bank of America structure but certain preferred stocks also offer the ability to protect your portfolio from higher rates. Floating rate preferreds have upside to liquidation value and ability to see potentially higher dividends but only if rates move significantly higher. The fixed-rate Series L preferred also offers some protection from higher rates through the out-of-the-money common stock conversion option but is still likely to face near-term pressure from higher rates. Fortunately having such a variety of investment options also gives investors the ability to hedge interest rates by purchasing their own combination of Bank of America common and preferred shares.

We acknowledge that Bank of America has been a relative outperformer post election but we also believe that share of Bank of America can still run further on and improved earnings outlook. Our $23 price target and dividend assumptions imply a 14.9% total return over the next twelve months. As we look to 2018, we expect Bank of America to post 6.9% positive operating leverage as the combined benefit of higher rates and the ongoing cost save program help push Bank of America’s operating leverage to best among peers (2.6% average operating leverage). Given where Bank of America currently trades, we believe the valuation for Bank of America is still attractive even after the recent outperformance—up 20.5% post election versus peers which were up 13.5% on average.

      "title": "Is Bank Of America Still A Buy?",
      "text": "Is Bank Of America Still A Buy? Nov.30.16 \nRecent Rally should continue in the short-term. \nThe stock is still trading at a discount despite the rally. \nProspect of friendly regulatory environment and rising interest rates is good for the banking industry. \nBoth these factors will enhance profitability. \nBanking companies will be some of the main beneficiaries of Donald Trump's election as the president. We have already seen how base metals have responded as the expectation of increased infrastructure spending has resulted in a strong rally in base metal prices. Banking stocks have also been performing well in the last three weeks. Bank of America (NYSE: BAC ) has been one of the best performers in the sector, and I believe the rally will continue at least in the short-term. Long-term prospects are looking increasingly brighter as the new government is expected to take steps to stimulate growth. \nFirst of all, let me explain the regulatory environment. Banks are subject to some of the tightest controls as they are mainly the engines of growth in an economy. If the financial system fails, almost all the related industries fail. This means that the central bank has to ensure that the financial system survives in the worst scenarios. However, sometimes these regulatory measures can go too far and start to have a negative impact. Hike in required liquidity reserves was one of the regulations that helped the U.S. financial system to have a stronger footing in the wake of the financial crisis of 2008. However, as the economy has grown, this requirement has remained on the higher side. \nThis rationale behind an increased liquidity requirement is simple and understandable. If the bank is unable to meet withdrawal requests, then it will create panic and the demand for withdrawals will increase further. Continued inability to meet withdrawal requests will make the people believe that the bank has defaulted and they cannot pay their money. The thing with the financial system is that the panic like this does not stay limited to one player. This will create fear and panic and the whole financial system will collapse. However, the downside of this measure is that being conservative ties a large amount of funds to low-yield assets. Bank of America has more than $500 billion in liquid assets and these assets are earning less than 1.5%, the rate of short-term government securities . Let's assume that the Trump government keeps its promise and eases regulatory burden on the banking sector, then Bank of America will stand to benefit heavily. The spread between the short-term rate and the lending rate is around 1.5%. A reduction in reserve liquidity requirements will free more cash for lending and the interest income will rise further. \nDonald Trump will need to ease regulatory framework for the banking sector in order to meet his increased investment targets. If he plans on increasing spending on infrastructure and stimulate growth, then the banks need to have more funds available for lending. Decreasing the liquidity requirements will be the easiest way to do that. \nIf the regulatory measures are eased, then the banks will start to earn more even without any increase in the interest rates from the Federal Reserve. However, if the Federal Reserve increases the interest rate as they have been saying , then the income side of the banks will get double boost. Interest income and net interest margin (NIM) will go up as the spread will widen. For Bank of America, interest rate increase will yield better results than most of its peers. The bank has one of the largest loans portfolios and its total revenue is skewed heavily towards the interest income. For the third quarter, interest income was more than 58% of the total revenues. Mostly, this figure has been around 60% for the bank and if the interest rates rise then we can see this ratio move towards 65%. JPMorgan's (NYSE: JPM ) interest income accounts for 56% and Wells Fargo's (NYSE: WFC ) ratio is close to 59%. \nIn terms of valuation, Bank of America still looks a better pick than some of its peers. The table below shows the comparison between Bank of America and some of its peers. \nClick to enlarge \nSource: SEC Filings, Yahoo!Finance, Morningstar.com, Ycharts \nBAC trades at a discount to its book value, indicating that the stock is still far from being overvalued despite the recent rally. Well Fargo and JPMorgan are both trading above their book values. Citigroup (NYSE: C ), however, is trading at a deeper discount than Bank of America. Taking out the impact of intangible assets, BAC's valuation goes higher. The stock is trading at a premium of about 19%. The tangible book value ratio is still lower than JPMorgan and Wells Fargo. Again, Citigroup is trading at a discount of 14% to its tangible book value per share. This type of discount in all metrics might hint towards a fundamental problem as the sentiment about the banking sector is bullish. However, I have not done any in-depth analysis about Citigroup here so I will refrain from commenting further on this stock. These ratios here are just for comparison. Based on these ratios, there is still room for Bank of America to go up. \nIt is true that Bank of America has had a good run and there might be a slight pull back. However, the market has not completely priced in the positives, in my opinion. Rising interest rate will increase profitability and Donald Trump's easier regulatory environment will allow for further gains. Donald Trump will need to unshackle banks in order to have increased investment. Internally, the cost cutting measures will continue to bear fruits and the profitability will also get a boost from inside. Bank's common Tier I ratio is at over 11%. Eased regulatory requirements might also result in an increase in dividend. All these factors are pointing towards a profitable 2017 for Bank of America. It is still a buy despite the recent rally.    ",

      "text": "Is Bank of America's Rally Over? PART: Is Bank of America's Rally Over? PART 1 OF 9 What Factors Are Driving Bank of America’s Stock Price? By Rebecca Keats | Nov 30, 2016 4:53 pm EST Expectations of an interest rate hike \nBank of America stock has risen 23% in November and has outperformed its peers. In this series, we’ll look at the key drivers behind BAC’s rally. \nAs December 14 approaches, investors are getting anxious to know whether the Federal Reserve will raise its policy rates. Bank stocks ( XLF ) are generally volatile ahead of FOMC meetings, as investors become nervous about what the Fed will eventually decide. Bank of America, like most other banks, stands to benefit from an interest rate hike. BAC’s income is far more sensitive to interest rates than its peers Wells Fargo ( WFC ), JPMorgan ( JPM ), and Citigroup (C). Trump’s win \nBanking regulations like the Dodd-Frank Act and stress tests meant to safeguard the broader economy have limited Bank of America’s capital return plans. If Trump is able to relax such regulations, Bank of America would be able to hike its dividends to 4% and repurchase 5%–7% of its shares with its earnings. Further, relaxation of such rules also means the bank would benefit from lower legal expenses. 4Q outlook \nBank of America is expected to report double-digit growth in fourth quarter trading revenues on higher volumes after the US presidential election. A t an investor conference in November, c Chief operating officer Tom Montag said that heightened volatility after the surprising Trump victory will help trading desks at Bank of America. Client trading volumes both in Japan and New York were higher than usual during the election. Downgrades \nBank of America was downgraded by three analysts amid a rally in bank stocks in November. Analysts believe the bank’s shares are no longer as cheap as they were before the post-election surge. Low valuations \nBank of America stock trades at a discount to its book value. Most of its peers like JP Morgan ( JPM ), Wells Fargo ( WFC ), and Goldman Sachs ( GS ) trade between one to two times their book values. Prospects of a rate hike in December are driving its stock price upwards. \nIn the following parts of this series, we’ll discuss these growth drivers in detail.

      "text": "The two long stories of Bank of America. \nBAC's fundamentals are sound. \nLong term optimism is different from short term enthusiasm. In an earlier article , I had no doubts in affirming that Bank Of America (NYSE: BAC ) showed a strong upside potential in the medium and long term. Even in the short term I saw good investment opportunities provided they were properly monitored. I wrote this on June 1 at a time when rate hikes were only an expectation. With the Trump administration, interest rates will likely rise quickly, which will benefit banks especially those that are more solid and profitable. It would be unnecessary to develop topics that everyone knows as the fact that a stronger economic growth is predicted for the near future and that the likely rise in inflation will also imply a rise in interest rates. All of this is great news for BAC because it is also obvious that since loans are usually linked to the 10-year Treasury yield its revenue will increase much more than the interest it pays to customers. In other words, the loan spread will be wider which will make it possible for banks to earn more profits. I have already said that Bank Of America is a true case study because over the years its share price has presented fluctuations in a blatant way. As the chart below clearly illustrates the movement of its price is a monumental roller coaster with two different stories. One that ended in late 2006 and another that started in early 2012. It's like a second life that leaves behind tremendous drawdowns between those two dates. Click to enlarge Charts courtesy of StockCharts.com Note: All charts are in semi-logarithmic scale and historical price data was adjusted to remove gaps caused by stock splits, dividends and distributions. It should be noted that Bank Of America's situation is sound and can thus make the most of this new phase. Still without the highly positive outcome of relevant interest rate increases, the bank's situation was promising as we can conclude from the words of BAC's CEO Brian Moynihan about Q3 2016 earnings call: \nLong-term rates are down compared to last year, yet earnings have grown. Despite that, net interest income is up 3% from third quarter '15, while net interest yield has been stable because we grew core loans and deposits.(...) Deposits are core part of what drives our franchise earnings. We have 1.2 trillion of deposits that's proof the customers entrust us to safeguard their money.(...) Nearly $450 billion or 36% of our deposits are non-interest bearing, a very strong mix. Deposits on average grew $68 billion year-over-year or 6%. Seeking Alpha Transcript In addition, it is crucial to remember that on Q3 2016 BAC's charge-off ratio declined to 40 basis points setting a historic low. With a very strong trading volume, Bank Of America shares started a new rush exactly the day after Election Day. In fact, in sixteen trading sessions BAC's share price has climbed from $16.94 to $21.70 in mid-session today. Momentum is evident but let's see if share prices are not rising too fast too soon. Click to enlarge Conclusion While BAC is skyrocketing with the fuel of rate hikes soon, one thing is sure in a calmer look: if the economy really grows as expected with a strong housing market, the bank will benefit hugely on the medium to long term. But its short term share price advance may seem too fast to be sustainable. Investor confidence is understandable and acceptable, but some caution is needed. Of course, long-term investors will welcome BAC's positive expectations based on solid fundamentals.

      "text": "Biographies and photos of senior Bank of America executives Phoenix’s New Retirement: Not Retiring \nMerrill Edge® Report Questions Whether or Not Retirement Is Near Extinction, Explores Residents’ Ideas Toward Retirement Savings Category: Friday, December 2, 2016 9:00 am EST Dateline: PDF Print RSS \nThe majority (82 percent) of today’s Phoenix labor force expects they will continue to work during retirement, whether for income, to keep busy or pursue a passion. This is a stark contrast to the 68 percent of area retirees, who   latest Merrill Edge® Report – a biannual survey of 1,000 mass affluent Americans 1 , which oversampled 300 Phoenix residents between September 24 and October 5, 2016 – reveals a twist in how today’s younger generations will plan and save for their later years. Nineteen percent of area respondents   goals. \n“We are reaching a pivotal time in the Phoenix community, where retirement as we know it may change forever, particularly for younger generations,” said Christine Baim, region sales executive of Merrill Edge. “It’s integral to remember that despite the uncertainties many of today’s non-retirees may have about their later years, whatever you save and invest today, even a small amount, can make a significant difference in the future.” \nGrowing uncertainty and insecurity around savings \nIn line with the national findings, the report also reveals many Phoenix residents are unable to articulate their “magic number” – the amount of money they need to live their desired retirement and those who can, are underestimating the amount. \nWhen asked what their magic number for retirement is, 48 percent don’t anticipate needing more than $1 million, and 12 percent simply “don’t know.” Sixty-five percent of today’s retirees said they did not have a number in mind before they retired. \nWhat’s more, 21 percent of respondents cite they need to win the lottery in order to reach their financial goals in retirement. \nIncreasing self-reliance with investment decisions \nDespite this uncertainty, Phoenix respondents still prefer to rely on themselves for their investment approach (64 percent), and only 18 percent believe they need to hire a financial advisor in order to live the retirement they want. \nWhen asked why they are saving for retirement, many area residents cite to afford daily life (67 percent) and take care of family (43 percent). \n  full   \n\n1   Edge Merrill  ",
