      "text": "Tweet \nLast month, Apple unveiled new MacBook Pro laptops. While the machines were undoubtedly great, their prices were very high -- even for Apple. Despite the cost, they are apparently flying off virtual shelves, as shipping dates are now in late December . In other words, price be damned, people will buy what they want, and are willing to splurge on quality. The old adage of \"you get what you pay for\" is sometimes quite true. \nToday, Apple announces a $300 hardcover book called \"Designed by Apple in California\". It is a paper book comprised of high-quality photographs of the company's products. There are two sizes being offered, with the smaller (10.20\" x 12.75\") costing $200 and the larger (13\" x 16.25\") costing $300. Are those prices high? Yes. Is Apple crazy to ask that much? Nope. In fact, the company is wise to set a high price, as it sets the value and desirability at a high level. \n\"Apple today announced the release of a new hardbound book chronicling 20 years of Apple's design, expressed through 450 photographs of past and current Apple products. 'Designed by Apple in California', which covers products from 1998's Mac to 2015's Apple Pencil, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple's design team over two decades of innovation\", says the company. \nJony Ive, chief design officer explains, \"the idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve's motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future. This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines\". \nYou can purchase the book from Apple.com starting tomorrow in the following countries. It will also be in select brick-and-mortar Apple retail stores. Australia",

Shot by Andrew Zuckerman in Apple's trademark ultra-minimalist style, the images show off the team's design process all the way up to the final product.

Information from the phone would be displayed in the glasses, which could also feature AR capabilities. \nReports claim that Apple has already started talking to suppliers about its project. It has also ordered near-eye displays for testing, although one source claims that it is not enough to start mass production. \nTesting the waters \nApple may not progress with the technology if initial tests do not show promise. However, were it to progress with AR, one source claimed it would be 2018 at the earliest before Apple made official announcements of its technology. \nIt's not the only technology firm pushing into AR. Oculus, best known for its VR technology, recently started hiring for an AR Incubation Lead to start up a new division dedicated to augmented reality, while CastAR is already developing its own headset of the same name.

      "text": "The original iPhone in Apple's new \"Designed by Apple in California\" photo book. (Photo: Apple)\nLooking for a new Apple product this holiday season for the Apple fan in your life? Want to keep the spending under the price of a new Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad or MacBook?\nIt isn't a gadget. It's a photo book.\nTaking its name from the phrase found on every Apple product, “Designed by Apple in California” is perfect for the Apple lover. As with most Apple products, it will be available in two sizes: a \"small\" for $199 and a \"large\" version for $299. Both will feature linen-bound hardcovers with the pages \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\"\nThere does not appear to be the option to buy the book in \"rose gold\" or \"jet black.\"\nThe goal of the Apple-published book is to chronicle the company's past 20 years of product design, from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. There are 450 photographs of past and present Apple devices as well as photos that document the company's design process and techniques.\nApple dedicated the book to its late founder, Steve Jobs.\n\"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are,\" writes Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer in the book's foreword.\n\"It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\"\nThe iPhone-maker will begin selling the book tomorrow, November 16, on Apple.com and in various, but not all, Apple Stores around the world. Those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars can check out the book at one of those locations, free of charge.\nFollow Eli Blumenthal on Twitter @eliblumenthal .\n24 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN 3 COMMENT EMAIL MORE //usat.ly/2fuhYtO",

      "title": "Apple's new product is a $300 photo book about its devices",
      "text": "By James Walker 4 mins ago in Technology Apple is known for its modest, coherent image. Today, it seemingly forgot that, launching a $300 photo book that trumpets its designs from the past two decades. It has been created to celebrate 20 years of the \"Designed by Apple in California\" moniker. Apple announced the photo book today. It described the hardbound book as \"an objective representation\" of its work. It's dedicated to the memory of co-founder Steve Jobs and includes over 450 photos of Apple products past and present. Designs ranging from 1998's iMac to 2015's Apple Pencil are included. The book was assembled over a period of eight years. Photographer Andrew Zuckerman worked in a \"profoundly close\" collaboration with groups across Apple to capture photos of the company's most significant products of the past two decades. A deliberately minimal, abstract style is used , in keeping with the company's reputation for premium quality. Apple's \"Designed by Apple in California\" $300 design photo book Apple Apple sees the book as a symbol of what it means to work at the company. It's positioned somewhere between a simple photo album and a comprehensive design log. Products including the iPod, iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch are present, alongside smaller pieces of hardware like the Apple Pencil. Apple said it's a reflection of its desire \"to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\" \"The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,\" said Jony Ive , Apple’s chief design officer. \"This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\" The physical book is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper bound in linen. It features gilded matte silver edges with eight colour separations and low-ghost ink. It takes the company's famous \"Designed by Apple in California\" maker's mark as its title. Apple seems to have put as much attention into the volume's design as its regular products receive, creating a book that it thinks fans will enjoy leafing through. Apple's \"Designed by Apple in California\" $300 design photo book Apple \"Designed by Apple in California\" will be available from tomorrow from select Apple Stores worldwide. It will also be offered from Apple.com in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the U.K. and the U.S. As with all recent Apple products, two sizes are available: small (10.20\" x 12.75\") and large (13\" x 16.25\"). Pricing will be $199 and $299 respectively, making sales to anyone but the most devout Apple follower unlikely. A similar volume about Apple was published 20 years ago. As AppleInsider notes , the company granted complete internal access to the author of \"Apple design: The work of the Apple Industrial Design Group\" in 1998. It had a less catchy title but also a far lower price, costing just $30 when new. It has since become a collector's item , suggesting early purchasers of its modern counterpart could own valuable books in the future.",

      "text": "If you’re buying a new MacBook Pro , you better upgrade to an SSD size you’re comfortable with. MacRumors reader Jesse D. found a surprise on his new 15-inch MacBook Pro after unscrewing the bottom — the SSD was soldered to the logic board. If you’ve been paying attention, this isn’t all that shocking. Apple killed the ability to upgrade RAM in 2012 by soldering it in; it’s only logical that the SSD would follow suit at some point. And follow suit it did. Last year’s 12-inch MacBook was the first to feature a non-upgradeable SSD, but I think many of…\n\nThis story continues at The Next Web",

      "text": "Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo \nApple announced on Tuesday that it’s now selling a book titled Designed by Apple in California , a phrase stamped on many of the company’s products. The book “celebrates” 20 years of Apple design and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n“‘Designed by Apple in California,’ which covers products from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil, also documents the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team over two decades of innovation,” Apple said, noting that more than 450 of its iconic products are photographed in the book. \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,” Apple’s head of design Jony Ive said. “We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” A very expensive Apple book \nThere are small and large versions that sell for $199 and $299, respectively. They’ll launch in stores beginning tomorrow, including many of Apple’s flagship locations. The book is certainly not for everyone, only the strongest of Apple fans and folks interested in design and what Apple has done in the space. The pricing seems a little bizarre to me, I can’t figure out why it costs at least $200, but perhaps Apple is trying to make this a limited edition product.

      "text": "Apple announces coffee table book highlighting 20 years of industrial design Expect to pay at least $199 for the opportunity on Nov 15, 2016, 1:45 PM TechSpot \nApple on Tuesday added a new product – a book – to its stable that nobody saw coming. It's not a new MacBook Pro, mind you (that came in September ), but an actual, physical book that’ll set you back at least $199. \nThe book, Designed by Apple in California , is a linen-bound, hardcover volume that chronicles 20 years of Apple’s design expressed through 450 photographs illustrating the company’s design process as well as its finished products. Photographs were captured by Andrew Zuckerman , perhaps best known for his style of capturing subjects against a white background. \nApple says the book is dedicated to the memory of co-founder Steve Jobs . \nIn the foreword for the book, Apple’s Chief Design Officer writes: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nDesigned by Apple in California, which Apple says was developed over an eight-year period, will be printed using specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges using eight color separations and low-ghost ink (if that means anything to you). Apple served as its own publisher on the project. \nIt’ll be offered in two sizes – a small version measuring 10.20” x 12.75” priced at $199 and a large version measuring 13” x 16.25” that’ll command $299 – and will go on sale November 16 (tomorrow) via Apple’s website and at select Apple retail stores in the US. That’s an awful lot of money (Apple tax) for a coffee table book but for the diehard Apple fan or those with enough disposable income, it may be worth the money. Related Reads",

      "text": "Is This Apple's Big Push into Augmented Reality? November 15, 2016, 09:24:55 AM EDT By Chris Ciaccia Apple (Shutterstock photo) \nInvestors have been pressing for Apple ( AAPL ) to find their \"next big hit,\" whether it's the car, Apple Watch, or something else. If CEO Tim Cook's comments about augmented reality (also known as AR) are an indication, the next hit may be closer than initially thought. \nBloomberg reported that Apple is considering working on wearable glasses, a la Google Glass, which could \"connect wirelessly to iPhones,\" and show images and \"other information\" in the field of vision. This sounds almost exactly like Google Glass. \nGoogle Glass failed as a consumer product, but has taken on new life as a product in enterprise, particularly medicine . \nWe're starting to see AR come into the lexicon and be accepted, in both software and hardware form, which bodes well for Apple -- should it choose to get into the field. \nThis summer, Pokemon Go was responsible for most people learning about AR, when it took the world by storm, as seemingly everyone was playing it. The game has more than 500 million downloads on both iOS and Android and changed Nintendo's financial profile drastically. \nSnap Inc. (the artist formerly known as Snapchat) is thought by many to be the first AR-first company, thanks to the popularity of its virtual filters and lenses when someone snaps. Now, thanks to the early popularity of its Spectacles glasses, people are getting more comfortable knowing that others are taking pictures of the world around them. \nThis is very different then how people acted with Google Glass, suggesting that the technology is getting closer to being accepted, if it isn't already. \nMeanwhile, Cook has made several comments in recent months about the prospects of AR and how it will fit into our daily lives. The venerable Apple CEO recently spoke with Utah Senator Orrin Hatch and noted that although AR will take a while, it will be as commonplace as our phones. \n\"AR is going to take a while, because there are some really hard technology challenges there,\" Cook said during the conversation. \"But it will happen, it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it. Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\" \nApple and Tim Cook usually don't talk so glowingly about a form of technology unless they are entering the field, in some way shape or form. It was done with the Watch , it's been done with television , and with mobile payments, all fields Apple entered during the past few years. \nAlthough Apple typically doesn't talk about future plans or products, Cook's comments on certain technologies have provided the markets with a hint where Apple is going next. \nIt's a good bet that Apple is getting into AR, in some way shape or form. If glasses are ultimately the way Apple chooses to do it, the response to Spectacles, Pokemon Go, and other forms of the technology are signaling society is ready for it. \nWe're waiting, Apple. \nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.

      "text": "By Timi Cantisano News Reporter Neowin LLC @timicantisano · 7 minutes ago with 4 comments \nAs the year winds down, a majority of companies have released their products to market and are already preparing for 2017. In a surprise move, Apple has unveiled one final product for the year, \"Designed by Apple in California\". \n\"Designed by Apple in California\" is a bit removed from the company's traditional products. As you can see on the right, the item is a hardbound book that was painstakingly \"developed over an eight-year period\". In true Apple fashion, the company shares the creation process by highlighting that it is \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" The picture book is a celebration of Apple's products over the past 20 years and is an homage to the company's designs and innovation. The book contains 450 photos that include forgotten relics like the 1998 iMac and more modern items like the Apple Pencil and Apple Watch . \nThe book will come in two sizes - the small which measures in at 10.20” x 12.75” will be priced at $199, while the larger book priced at $299 measures in at 13” x 16.25”. The book will be available tomorrow through Apple's website and will also be available at select retail locations around the world.",

      "text": "print \nApple's iPhone 7 Plus. Reuters/Issei Kato Apple will launch three new iPhones in 2017, according to a new note from KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\nAs noted by MacRumors , the note mainly focuses on the display and camera technology in next years iPhones. Kuo believes that there’ll be two sizes with LCD screens — similar to today's iPhone and iPhone Plus — and one with an OLED screen (and dual cameras). \nOLED is a type of display tech that’s already available on numerous high-end phones today. The Samsung Galaxy S7 and Google Pixel are two notable examples. It allows for an infinite contrast ratio, which helps colors pop more onscreen. Done right, it could be a notable improvement over what's on current iPhones. Apple itself has already adopted the tech with the Apple Watch and the Touch Bar of the new MacBook Pro. \nRumors for the 2017 iPhone have been all over the map, and as always you should take this one with a big heaping of salt. It wasn’t long ago that an “ iPhone 7 Pro ” was rumored alongside the eventual iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, and that never came to pass. \nBut reports of Apple adopting OLED as part of a radical, all-glass redesign for next year’s iPhone have popped up repeatedly in recent months, and the notion of Apple using a third device to introduce it isn’t new either. Past rumors have suggested that the third model could be anywhere between 5 and 5.8 inches. \nPlus, these latest predictions come from Kuo, who has a very long track record of figuring out Apple devices before they launch. \nNevertheless, we're probably 10 months away from a new iPhone launch, and even Apple might not know how 2017 is going to shake out.

      "text": "Apple has its sights set on strapping even more devices to your body.\nA new report from Bloomberg Nov. 14 suggests that the company is looking into developing a pair of smart glasses. The device, which is still under development, would connect wirelessly to an iPhone—much like an Apple Watch does—and tell you similar sorts of information. It will be able to give you notifications, tell you how far you’ve walked and which way you’re headed, along with other tidbits that might be more useful to know as you look straight ahead, rather than down at your phone or wrist.\nApple has explored at least one design for its glasses that looks similar to some popular sunglasses already on the market. In a design mockup shared with Quartz by a source with knowledge of the project, the glasses looked rather like a pair of sunglasses made by the online glasses startup Warby Parker.\nApple declined to comment.\nLate last week, Snap, the newly formed parent company of Snapchat, started selling Spectacles , a pair of video-recording sunglasses, out of vending machines that have been popping up in random locations across the US. The glasses also connect to a smartphone using Bluetooth, and have a design similar to the potential design of Apple’s glasses. Spectacles, however, do not have any sort of augmented-reality capabilities, though many believe that is where the wearable will eventually be headed.\nApple CEO Tim Cook has mentioned his interest in augmented reality in the past. Earlier this year on an earnings call, Cook said that games like Pokémon Go showed that “AR can be really great,” adding that the company is “high on AR for the long run,” and that the technology could represent “a great commercial opportunity” for the company. It’s unknown whether Apple’s smart glasses would be capable of augmenting the world that users see through the glasses, or whether they would just display static information, rather like the heads-up displays on found in some luxury cars .\nApple has been in search of a new product to kickstart slumping sales in recent quarters. The company released its first new product, the Apple Watch—another Bluetooth connected wearable—in 2015, but it has not yet seen the wide appeal that has been enjoyed by its other products. And the latest releases of the company’s staple products, including the iPhone, Mac computers, and iPad tablets, have seen lackluster sales and middling reviews recently. A new product like smart glasses could be what Apple needs to return to growth, although as Bloomberg reports, it’s unlikely that these glasses, if they even are released, will be available earlier than 2018, given that the glasses in question are still in the testing phase.\nSmart glasses aren’t a surefire avenue to growth. Early movers like Google Glass were reviled as expensive, awkward devices that didn’t achieve much. And while there’s been early positive reviews for Snap’s Spectacles, it remains to be seen if they’ll garner wide appeal. It’s also uncertain whether this is the sort of device that Apple customers will be clambering for. That being said, even the underwhelming Apple Watch has likely sold millions of units since its launch.\nThe challenge right now is that we don’t really know what “a product like this” is, Jackdaw Research lead analyst Jan Dawson told Quartz. “Apple tends not to enter a market unless there’s some proven demand for a product or it feels like it can create new demand, so I would expect them to work very hard to establish a clear market opportunity here before launching something.” Dawson didn’t feel that Apple’s research into smart glasses was in response to Spectacles, given that Apple has multiple glasses-related patents , spanning years of work, but will be wary of competitors’ failures: “Given the failure of Google Glass, you wouldn’t expect Apple to even want to emulate those.”",

      "text": "Apple may be preparing its own Google Glass competitor   5:05 pm - Author Matthew Wilson \nA couple of years back, Google made a big push for augmented reality with Google Glass but unfortunately the project ultimately failed to catch on. Despite Google Glass’s failure, it doesn’t seem to have scarred Apple away from developing a similar device of its own as reports this week claim that Apple is currently working on its own augmented reality glasses. \nAccording to Bloomberg’s sources, Apple has begun looking into potentially creating a competing device to Google Glass (now Project Aura) and has even ordered “small quantities of near-eye displays” from suppliers for prototype and testing purposes. \nConcept image. \nApple threw itself into the wearable market back in 2015 with the launch of the Apple Watch and now, it seems the company may want to expand its wearable range with smartglasses in the future. According to the report, if this product does end up hitting the market, the plan would be to have them wirelessly link up with the iPhone, similarly to the Apple Watch. \nApple’s own version of Glass would display images and information directly in the user’s field of view but a product like this likely won’t be announced until 2018 at the earliest. Obviously, this is all rumour for now but given that Tim Cook has been talking about Augmented Reality non-stop this year, this information is quite believable. \nKitGuru Says: We have heard that Apple is experimenting with Augmented Reality but I do wonder if another stab at smartglasses is the way to go. Either way, it would be interesting to see what Apple comes up with. Did any of you guys try Google Glass back in the day? Do you think its the sort of thing that could catch on eventually?",

      "text": "NEW YORK: Apple CEO Tim Cook is telling his employees to “keep moving forward.” Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is saying “progress does not move in a straight line.” T-Mobile’s CEO John Legere tweeted “let’s see what an out of the box, non-typical, non-politician can do for America!”\nCEOs of major companies are taking stands about the results of the election — a departure from the traditional model of not mixing politics with business that major brands have long espoused.\nSome are using it as an opportunity to bring their employees together following a divisive election campaign. Others are using it as an opportunity to stress their companies’ values and mission, or an opportunity to make nice with Trump, who many CEOs were publicly against during the campaign. Tim Cook \nThe men and woman who head the nation’s biggest companies know that having a hostile relationship with the Trump administration could make doing business difficult. They also know that they operate in liberal bastions like New York and San Francisco just as much as in Trump-leaning places like Fort Wayne, Indiana, or Charleston, West Virginia.\n“Neutral is the best policy,” says John Challenger, CEO of workplace consultant Challenger, Gray & Christmas. \nT-Mobile’s Legere, who long was vocally opposed to Trump, congratulated the president-elect on Twitter for his victory, while holding off on judging the president-elect’s policies. Meanwhile another telecommunications executive, Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure, himself an immigrant and personally opposed to Trump, sent an email to employees saying that “it’s our obligation to accept the will of our fellow Americans and respect the new leader.” John Legere \nIt’s possible that Legere and Claure made nice because the president appoints the chairman and commissioners of the Federal Communications Commission, an agency that holds enormous influence over the telecommunications industry. All five FCC commissioners will see their terms expire during Trump’s first term.\nCEOs of automakers, including Ford’s Mark Fields, have also struck a conciliatory tone, partly because Trump has called for the repeal or renegotiation of the North American Free Trade Agreement, which has allowed the automakers to set up shop in Mexico tariff-free.\nMany CEOs publicly expressed hope that the tensions dividing the country will diminish, and that American consumers will set aside their fears and get back to what they do best: shop.\n“We are hoping that in the postelection we are just going to see people ready to spend,” said Marvin Ellison, CEO of JCPenney.\nCEOs and companies that try to bring people together are “going to be the winners,” says Dr Larry Chiagouris, a marketing professor at Pace University’s Lubin School of Business. “That always works better from a brand perspective,” he says.\nWall Street, which donated heavily to Hillary Clinton, also now faces an administration that could provide both profit and peril.\nTrump has said he wants to roll back some of the regulations in the Dodd-Frank law that was passed after the financial crisis, a move that would benefit big Wall Street banks. But the Republican Party’s platform also contains a provision calling for the return of the Glass-Steagall Act, a Great Depression-era law that broke up big banks.\nThere’s talk of a massive, $1 trillion (Dh3.67 trillion) infrastructure programme that could rely on tax credits to private funding sources. Many of those programs will require Wall Street’s army of investment bankers and lawyers to help underwrite and finance.\n“The president-elect’s commitment to infrastructure spending, government reform and tax reform — among other things — will be good for growth and, therefore, will be good for our clients and for our firm,” said Goldman Sachs CEO Lloyd Blankfein, according to a transcript of a voicemail he sent companywide.\nIn an email to his employees, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the election of Trump shows “the frustration that so many people have with the lack of economic opportunity and the challenges they face.”\nTrump’s victory drew a range of responses from CEOs in Silicon Valley, where popular sentiment had tilted strongly against Trump because of his statements on immigrants, women, overseas manufacturing and the use of encryption in consumer products like Apple’s iPhones.\nIn a post-election email to employees, Apple CEO Cook didn’t mention Trump by name but acknowledged that many people had strong feelings about the outcome of the vote. Cook had let it be known during the campaign that he didn’t support Trump, although he generally avoided taking a public stance on the candidates. In his email, Cook said Apple would continue to support diversity.\nCook didn’t mention encryption, which he has previously argued is essential to protect consumers’ privacy. But he added, “While there is discussion today about uncertainties ahead, you can be confident that Apple’s North Star hasn’t changed.”\nMicrosoft’s chief executive was more conciliatory. In a post on LinkedIn, the social networking site that Microsoft is buying, Satya Nadella wrote: “We congratulate the president-elect, and look forward to working with all those elected yesterday.” But Nadella added that Microsoft is committed to “fostering a diverse and inclusive culture.”\nFacebook’s Zuckerberg, who had previously criticised Trump’s call for building a wall on the Mexican border, sounded subdued in a post on his own social network.\n“I thought about all the work ahead of us to create the world we want for our children,” he wrote. “This work is bigger than any presidency and progress does not move in a straight line.”\nThe most combative response came from the CEO at Grubhub, an online food delivery service based in Chicago. Matt Maloney said in an email to employees that he rejects Trump’s “nationalist, anti-immigrant and hateful politics,” adding that anyone who disagrees should immediately resign “because you have no place here.”\nMaloney later backtracked in a tweet that said “Grubhub does not tolerate hate and we are proud of all our employees — even those who voted for Trump.”\nOther companies have taken the election and its aftermath as a marketing opportunity, most notably airlines. British Airways ran ads on Facebook urging people to visit London, using the tag line “had enough of this house?” under a photo of the White House. Air New Zealand ran ads on Instagram and elsewhere highlighting the results of the election and inviting people to visit New Zealand. Spirit Airlines promoted a 75 per cent off sale for flights to Canada.",

      "text": "Imagine the scene: Tim Cook is nervous. His palms are sweaty. The whole board room looks on, waiting for his killer announcement. The iPhone 7 underwhelmed the masses . A refresh of MacBooks added only a row of shiny buttons . He’s got one shot to make Apple great again—but he’s choking.\nHe removes his glasses. Massages the bridge of his nose. And it hits him. “Glasses,” he thinks to himself. “People didn’t buy watches, but I’ll damn well get them to buy glasses.”\nThat’s the scene one imagines could have played out upon reading a Bloomberg report that Apple is considering the idea of producing digital glasses. The specs would, we’re told, “connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality.”\nGoogle, with its ill-fated Glass project, tried and prominently failed to make such an idea work. Launched in April 2013 and later made available as part of an “Explorer Program” for the princely sum of $1,500, the glasses were canned as a commercial product in 2015. Aside from being ridiculously expensive and abhorrent to privacy advocates, perhaps its biggest failing was trying to invent the future far before the public was ready for it.\nEnter Snap, with its pared-back Spectacles . The Ray-Bans-esque glasses allow wearers to shoot video, transfer it to their smartphone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, then post it to Snapchat. That’s it. Simple and, it seems, compelling: the specs went on limited sale just last week and millennials are clamoring for the things .\nWhere would Apple’s offering land in comparison? No doubt they would be sleek and stylish—something James Bond might wear if his eyesight failed, rather than Snap’s Lady Gaga-friendly offering. They’d also likely be more expensive. But it’s unlikely that the market for Snap’s simple video-shooting glasses will scale in the way Apple needs if it plans for this to be the Next Big Thing.\nInstead, the device could be a vehicle for augmented reality. It’s no secret that Apple has been experimenting with virtual and augmented reality. A string of patents, hires, acquisitions, and admissions from Cook himself all suggest that Apple thinks that AR is more attractive to consumers than VR.\nApple could very well be sitting on something as exciting as a miniaturized version of Microsoft's Hololens or DAQRI’s Smart Helmet . While Pokémon Go whetted popular appetite for AR , it’s yet to have its big break. Apple could provide it.\nThe other possibility is that it could turn out to be Apple Watch Redux. The first iteration failed to capture the imagination of the gadget-buying populace, and its semi-pivot to make it more of a fitness tracker doesn’t seem to have injected much excitement.\nIf—and it’s a big if—Apple does make a pair of smart glasses, it will have to ensure that it’s a product that opens up new possibilities for consumers. A video camera and notification screen won’t be enough. It’ll need to, quite literally, help people see the world a little differently. Don’t blow it, Tim.\n(Read more: Bloomberg , “ Why Snap’s Spectacles Are Going to (Finally) Make Life Logging Cool ,” “ Why Apple Can’t Match the iPhone’s Success ,” “ Microsoft Is Looking Like the New Apple ”)",

Maps directions would show up on top of real-life streets, and you'd be able to see your iMessages and notifications without having to pull your phone out. That's a future Apple could be working toward, according to a new Bloomberg report that suggests the company is working on a pair of Google Glass-like augmented reality glasses.\n\nDetails are scarce on what could be Apple's first AR glasses, as Bloomberg notes that Apple is still in \"an exploration phase\" and likely wouldn't have anything ready until at least 2018. The device would likely sync with your iPhone, and would potentially add a variety of neat AR functions to Apple's existing apps.\nMORE: iPhone 8 Rumors: What to Expect from the 10th Anniversary iPhone \nWhile we don't know what Apple's smart glasses might look like or how they'd work, we do know how fond Apple CEO Tim Cook is of augmented reality, which allows people to see virtual objects laid atop of the real world. \nSpeaking to the Washington Post in August, Cook called AR a \"core technology\" and vaguely hinted that \"it's something we're doing a lot of things on behind [the] curtain.\" \nCook later told Good Morning America that he prefers augmented reality over virtual reality, stating that \"virtual reality sort of encloses and immerses the person into an experience that can be really cool, but probably has a lower commercial interest over time.\"\nIf Apple does release a pair of AR glasses, they'll probably help you get around. The company recently secured a patent for a possible AR navigation platform , which would use cameras and accelerometers to figure out where you are in the real world and give you appropriate directions.\nWhile Google Glass flopped a few years ago due to its high price and short battery life, Apple will likely have plenty of competition once it officially enters the AR space. Microsoft's HoloLens has consistently wowed with its ability to project Windows apps onto real-world environments, though it's currently only available as a $3,000 developer kit. Perhaps Apple should be more worried about the $129 Snapchat Spectacles , a more casual pair of sunglasses that let you create point-of-view videos and upload them to the wildly popular social network. \nSee Also : The Best iPhone 8 Concept Videos So Far \nThe Best iOS Apps You're Not Using (But Should Be) Best Smartwatches - Top Picks for Android and iOS Our Favorite Augmented Reality Apps About the author Michael Andronico @MikeAndronico Mike Andronico is an associate editor at Tom's Guide.

      "text": "Imagine the scene: Tim Cook is nervous. His palms are sweaty. The whole board room looks on, waiting for his killer announcement. The iPhone 7 underwhelmed the masses . A refresh of MacBooks added only a row of shiny buttons . He’s got one shot to make Apple great again—but he’s choking.\nHe removes his glasses. Massages the bridge of his nose. And it hits him. “Glasses,” he thinks to himself. “People didn’t buy watches, but I’ll damn well get them to buy glasses.”\nThat’s the scene one imagines could have played out upon reading a Bloomberg report that Apple is considering the idea of producing digital glasses. The specs would, we’re told, “connect wirelessly to iPhones, show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision, and may use augmented reality.”\n\nGoogle, with its ill-fated Glass project, tried and prominently failed to make such an idea work. Launched in April 2013 and later made available as part of an “Explorer Program” for the princely sum of $1,500, the glasses were canned as a commercial product in 2015. Aside from being ridiculously expensive and abhorrent to privacy advocates, perhaps its biggest failing was trying to invent the future far before the public was ready for it.\nEnter Snap, with its pared-back Spectacles . The Ray-Bans-esque glasses allow wearers to shoot video, transfer it to their smartphone via Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, then post it to Snapchat. That’s it. Simple and, it seems, compelling: the specs went on limited sale just last week and millennials are clamoring for the things .\nWhere would Apple’s offering land in comparison? No doubt they would be sleek and stylish—something James Bond might wear if his eyesight failed, rather than Snap’s Lady Gaga-friendly offering. They’d also likely be more expensive. But it’s unlikely that the market for Snap’s simple video-shooting glasses will scale in the way Apple needs if it plans for this to be the Next Big Thing.\nInstead, the device could be a vehicle for augmented reality. It’s no secret that Apple has been experimenting with virtual and augmented reality. A string of patents, hires, acquisitions, and admissions from Cook himself all suggest that Apple thinks that AR is more attractive to consumers than VR.\nApple could very well be sitting on something as exciting as a miniaturized version of Microsoft's Hololens or DAQRI’s Smart Helmet . While Pokémon Go whetted popular appetite for AR , it’s yet to have its big break. Apple could provide it.\nThe other possibility is that it could turn out to be Apple Watch Redux. The first iteration failed to capture the imagination of the gadget-buying populace, and its semi-pivot to make it more of a fitness tracker doesn’t seem to have injected much excitement.\nIf—and it’s a big if—Apple does make a pair of smart glasses, it will have to ensure that it’s a product that opens up new possibilities for consumers. A video camera and notification screen won’t be enough. It’ll need to, quite literally, help people see the world a little differently. Don’t blow it, Tim.\n(Read more:  Bloomberg , “ Why Snap’s Spectacles Are Going to (Finally) Make Life Logging Cool ,” “ Why Apple Can’t Match the iPhone’s Success ,” “ Microsoft Is Looking Like the New Apple ”)",

      "title": "Good News: Apple’s New Peach Emoji Will Still Look Like A Butt!",
      "text": "Email \nTech Crunch- Nobody can touch the peach butt emoji, not even Apple. A couple of weeks ago, Apple dropped the first iOS beta for iOS 10.2 with dozens of new and redesigned emojis. The world needs more emojis, I’m all for it. But Apple also accidentally redesigned the peach emoji and was a bit too literal — it didn’t quite look like a butt. Calm down, no need to grab the pitchforks. Apple released a new beta with a butt-looking peach emoji. \nAs you can see on the top image, the new peach emoji looks even more like a butt. Apple didn’t just roll back to the old emoji design. The company called its emoji designers again and asked them to redraw the peach emoji. Our country has been through a lot the last few days/weeks/months, so it’s nice to finally get a win for once. I blogged about the new emojis that would be coming out in iOS 10.2 and one of the biggest stories was the peach not really looking like a butt. However, wouldn’t you know that for once Apple has decided to not kick their customers in the proverbial dick and has reversed course. Look at that peach butt. Sexy as fuck. Rachel Starr level booty. I’ve always been more of a leg and ass guy and I approve the hell out of this peach tushy. I want to rub Vaseline all over that heinie and tell it that it’s special and different from everyone else’s. There have been a lot of things that has divided this country as of late, but I’m happy that we can come together as a people and still sext nice looking butts to each other. No protests or petitions needed. God bless the U.S.A. \nh/t Ballow",

Apple's, admittedly very fast , PCIe storage modules are now built right into the main boards of their 15-inch, Touch Bar-equipped, Retina-screened, Thunderbolt 3-ported, MacBook Pros. A few forum posts over at MacRumors reveal the skinny on the quiet removal of the last user-upgradable component of their professional-series laptops . From the report: \"MacRumors reader Jesse D. unscrewed the bottom lid on his new 15-inch MacBook Pro with a Touch Bar and discovered, unlike the 13-inch model sans Touch Bar, there is no cutout in the logic board for removable flash storage . Another reader said the 13-inch model with a Touch Bar also has a non-removable SSD. Given the SSD appears to be permanently soldered to the logic board, users will be unable to upgrade the Touch Bar MacBook Pro's flash storage beyond Apple's 512GB to 2TB built-to-order options on its website at the time of purchase. In other words, the amount of flash storage you choose will be permanent for the life of the notebook.\"",

      "text": "The texts you send from your Galaxy phone may soon look a lot like Apple's iMessages.\nSamsung said Tuesday it has acquired a Canada-based Rich Communications Services business from NewNet Communication Technologies. Called NewNet Canada, it will continue to operate independently as a unit of Samsung Electronics Canada.\nRCS essentially is the standard for the next generation of SMS text messaging . It makes regular text messages behave a lot like chat messaging apps, such as Facebook Messenger, iMessage and WhatsApp. But this new standard brings similar functionality to the basic SMS service already integrated into your phone. Samsung said users will be able to communicate on any network, with an RCS-enabled device or an SMS-only device.\nIt adds new features to simple text messaging, such as seeing when someone is typing back a response to your message and getting notifications when someone has seen a message. It also includes improved functions on group texts, which allow people to be added and deleted from group chats. And people can easily share and transfer large files like high-resolution photos.\nSamsung didn't immediately respond to a request for more information. The company said in a press release that \"this acquisition is a critical milestone not just for Samsung but also for the communications industry.\"\nCNET's Maggie Reardon contributed to this report.",

The Cupertino tech company recruited photographer Andrew Zuckerman to take 450 photos of Apple products made over the last two decades for the book, which is dedicated to Steve Jobs. In true Apple fashion, the book comes in a small size and a large size, separated by a familiar $100 difference. You can get yourself a copy here . Or, instead of buying that book, you can scroll through this post of great looking Apple products through the ages right here in your very own internet browser. We start with what is perhaps the most iconic piece of technology ever created: the iPhone 7 (2016): And this here is our old friend the iPod Mini ( 2004) : Shrine of Apple Looking at the the iPod Mini and all it's glory (6Gb worth) made us nostalgic for other old Apple tech, so here some of that. This is the Apple Newton, which the company made from 1993 to 1998: Man, those old iMacs were pretty. This baby right here is the Macintosh 128K Twiggy Mac. The Twiggy Mac was an early design of the first Macintosh. Instead of the conventional floppy disk drive, the Twiggy Mac was built with Steve Wozniak's own (very buggy) version of the floppy drive, which Apple called the Twiggy drive. Because the Twiggy drive was found to be very buggy, Apple changed the design of the original Mac for its 1984 release. Shrine of Apple If you're looking for more cool, old Apple stuff, Shrine of Apple has built a really nice little archive with lots of photos, specs and other nerdy Apple facts. And if even that doesn't cut it for you, you're probably the target audience of \"Designed by Apple in California,\" which you can read more about here . And if you just want more cool stuff from around the web hit up Digg's Originals archive , which is where we keep the really good stuff. \nJoey Cosco is an Associate Social Media and Video Editor at Digg.

      "text": "Follow About | \nAppleholic, (noun), æp·əl-hɑl·ɪk: An imaginative person who thinks about what Apple is doing, why and where it is going. Delivering popular Apple-related news, advice and entertainment since 1999. Even Apple’s new book uses ‘special’ paper “Designed by Apple in California” More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 15, 2016 5:34 AM PT RELATED TOPICS \nApple’s latest product is a hardback book detailing 20-years of Apple design, \" Designed by Apple in California ”. Special paper \nThe heavily illustrated book looks at Apple products from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. It documents the materials and techniques that Apple’s designers used to make them. Photographer, Andrew Zuckerman, took the images. The title is dedicated to Steve Jobs. And it is, “printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink,” Apple states . Special. Paper. For humanity… \n“The idea of genuinely trying to make something great for humanity was Steve’s motivation from the beginning, and it remains both our ideal and our goal as Apple looks to the future,” said Jony Ive, Apple’s chief design officer (interestingly, Apple now seems to like to make job titles lower case). \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years. We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nMost people know that there’s a big market for Apple-related books , with the best design-focused title, Apple Design , now only available secondhand. If you have the latter title then some of the presentation may seem a little familiar: sparse white pages with well-captured product shots, though not the use of “special” paper. An ‘objective representation’ \nWriting in the book’s foreword, Ive explains: \n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \n“We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.” A collector’s item \nThe linen-bound, hardcover book was developed over an eight-year period, the company says. Designed by Apple in California will be available beginning Wednesday, November 16, in two editions: Small (10.20” x 12.75”) at $199 (£169 in UK) and large (13” x 16.25”) at $299 (£249 in UK). (Apple kind of missed the chance of calling these editions “Pro” and “Plus”). \nYou won’t find it in your local bookshops, but you will be able to purchase it online in Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, the UK and the US. You will also find it in flagship Apple retail stores in London, Paris, Berlin, Hong Kong, China, Australia and in key locations across the US. \n(The latter includes Apple SoHo, Apple Fifth Avenue, Apple Upper East Side, Apple Williamsburg and Apple World Trade Center in New York; Apple The Grove in Los Angeles and Apple Third Street in Santa Monica; Apple North Michigan Avenue and Apple Lincoln Road in Chicago; Apple Northpark in Dallas; Apple Union Square in San Francisco; Apple Palo Alto and Apple Infinite Loop in Cupertino.) Apple What next? \nWe know Apple runs the secretive ‘Apple University’, an internal project designed to educated employees in some elements of Apple’s success. It seems likely that at least some of the knowledge gathered by that internal project may have informed this title – the course teaches things like “What Makes Apple, Apple,” for example. \nHopefully the company plans more titles, such as a Steve Jobs biography that actually teaches us something about how he really thought and worked, rather than the endless memorializing of his better and worse business decisions we’ve had to endure. I wait in hope. \nAll the same, Apple’s decision to publish a commemorative book is noteworthy. Critics will say it marks a moment when the company began looking backwards, rather than forwards, while champions will note that this focus on history is essential for the firm to move forward successfully with scale . Meanwhile, I think we just found this year’s best stocking filler for the Apple fan who has everything. \nGoogle+? If you use social media and happen to be a Google+ user, why not join AppleHolic's Kool Aid Corner community and join the conversation as we pursue the spirit of the New Model Apple? \nGot a story?

Sorry IDG News Service | Nov 15, 2016 4:15 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nApple is working on wearable digital glasses that would connect wirelessly to the iPhone and show content in the wearer’s field of vision, according to a news report. \nThe iPhone maker has indicated previously its interest in augmented reality. Unlike the simulated world of virtual reality, AR supplements with images and information the user’s normal view of the world. \n“ We are high on AR for the long run. We think there are great things for customers and a great commercial opportunity,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in an earnings call in July, talking about the need for Apple’s devices to work with other developers' products, such as the successful Pokémon Go game. \nThe company has also hired VR and AR experts and made some acquisitions that could help it meet its AR goals. Apple has discussed the glasses project with potential suppliers , reported Bloomberg on Monday, citing people familiar with those discussions. \nThe company may be close to a prototype stage as it is said to have ordered small quantities of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. The company hasn’t, however, ordered components in numbers that would suggest that mass production plans are imminent, a person told Bloomberg. \nApple could not be immediately reached for comment. The company will be entering a crowded markets where Microsoft is pushing its AR glasses, called HoloLens , while Facebook-owned Oculus VR is targeting the VR market. Google launched its VR headset called Daydream View that will work with compatible phones including the company's Pixel smartphones. \nApple’s glasses will be introduced in 2018 at the earliest, if the company goes ahead with the project, according to a Bloomberg source. New product categories, including the AR glasses, could help the company make up for falling iPhone sales. RELATED TOPICS",

All of the photos were snapped by Andrew Zuckerman, showing off 20 years of Apple design \" in a deliberately spare style \". \nApple's chief designer and slow talker of courage, Jony Ive, explains the book as \" a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years \", hoping that the book will be a \" resource for students of all design disciplines \". \nIn the foreword of the book, Ive writes: While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process, or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. \nWe strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent, and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.",

      "text": "According to http://Macrumors.com\nThis past September Apple released iOS 10.1 and with that came the loss of the peach butt emoji. The Internet took this personal and wanted to know why Apple would remove the popular emoji, but when you send prayers up blessings come down. Apple just released iOS 10.2, and the peach butt emoji has returned and revamped for everyone’s enjoyment. The new iOS is for beta teasers at the moment but will be released soon. Click the link below to see the new and improved peach butt emoji.\nhttp://www.macrumors.com/2016/11/15/apple-peach-emoji-ios-10-2-beta-3/ \n \n ",

      "text": "Apple's book — yes, book — Designed by Apple in California , which looks back at 20 years of Apple's product design, goes on sale on Nov. 16. And yes, it's expensive ($300 for the large copy and $200 for the small copy) just like Apple's devices.\nIt's strange for Apple to release a book that, well, celebrates itself. As soon as it was announced, people jumped on social media to declare how Apple's lost its way. That the book shows the company has taken its eye off the ball. Steve Jobs would never have released a book!\nExcept maybe Jobs would have.\nSEE ALSO: This book is the perfect gift for every Apple fanboy and fangirl \nIn an interview published by Wallpaper , Apple chief design officer Jony Ive says they first started thinking about creating the book about eight years ago. That's three years before Jobs passed away from pancreatic cancer.\nIve also reveals something shocking: Apple didn't have an archive of its own products.\n\"Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase.\"\n\"Many of the products that you see, we actually had to go out and purchase [laughs],\" Ive told Wallpaper. \"It's a rather shameful admission, but it's just not an area that we really invested much time or energy in, so we started to build an archive of the physical products.\"\nCrazy, right? \nApple, the tech company that leads the industry with purposeful product designs capable of convincing millions of people to buy their products before even seeing them in person, didn't have its own products to refer back to.\nApple's focus is on the future, not the past, so reminiscing isn't something its core designers do often, Ive said.\nIve's fondness for experimenting with new materials also extended beyond electronics to the book. The team behind the book actually created custom paper and custom inks to accurately portray the products and colors. Moreover, all of the products were re-shot over the years as photographic technology improved.\nIf you get a chance, the entire interview is well worth the read.",

      "text": "Move over, Apple Watch - there's a new wearable in town. Yep, next to jump on the smart glasses bandwagon is Apple, apparently. According to Bloomberg, Apple's facial wearables are still in an exploration phase, but the plan eventually is to get the device connecting wirelessly to iPhones. Apple's glasses would reportedly show images and other information in the wearer's field of vision and might even use CEO Tim Cook's favourite thing, augmented reality. The Cupertino, California-based tech giant has allegedly talked about its project with potential suppliers, even ordering a small amount of near-eye displays from one supplier for testing. This is all unconfirmed, however, and Apple spokeswoman Trudy Muller declined to comment to Bloomberg. One thing we do know is that Tim Cook prefers augmented reality to virtual reality... Back in September, just days after Apple's biggest announcement of the year, Cook said: \"There's virtual reality and there's augmented reality - both of these are incredibly interesting. \"But my own view is that augmented reality is the larger of the two, probably by far, because this gives the capability for both of us to sit and be very present talking to each other, but also have other things visually for both of us to see. \"Maybe it's something we're talking about, maybe it's someone else here that is not here, present, but could be made to appear to be present with us. So there's a lot of really cool things there.\" Want up-to-the-minute entertainment and tech news?

      "text": "Tags : iOS - iOS + Apple - Apple + Apps - Apps + Games - Games + Last quarter, Apple said that it would start cleaning house in the App Store. Now, the purge begins. According to data from Sensor Tower, the number of apps removed from the App Store by Apple last month rose by 238% sequentially to 47,300. That figure is also more than triple the 14,000 apps that Apple removed during an average month in 2016. Mobile games is the category most affected by Apple's purge with 28% of the removed apps coming from that group. After games, the other categories affected were Entertainment (8.99%), Books (8.96%), Education (7%) and Lifestyle (6%). Nearly half of the removed apps hadn't been updated since May 2015. And 25.6% had not seen an update since November 2013. Bottom line? Many of the apps taken out of the App Store were not what you might call freshly squeezed.Apple says that it receives 100,000 new and updated apps each week. The tech titan says that there are over 2 million apps on the shelves, and the growth will continue according to Sensor Tower. The latter sees 5 million apps in the App Store by 2020, an estimate it first made public this past August .The App Store has sure come a long way since July 2009 when it held 50,000 apps on its first anniversary .

      "text": "Apple is expected to introduce a major iPhone redesign next year, according to multiple reports, and a reliable source brings more details about Apple’s future iPhone plans. Specifically, an Apple insider says the company is expected to introduce three iPhone 8 models next year spread across two familiar sizes.\nDON’T MISS: New performance tests show just how dominant the iPhone 7 really is\nAccording to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, the iPhone 8 will come in 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch versions — therefore, the same sizes Apple used for the iPhone 6, iPhone 6s, and iPhone 7.\nKuo, who often comes forward with accurate insights into Apple’s future plans, says that Apple will use both LCD and OLED screens for the 2017 iPhone. The 4.7-inch iPhone 8 and 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus will have LCD displays. But Apple is also going to introduce a mew 5.5-inch iPhone 8 Plus version that’ll feature an OLED screen.\nFinally, both Plus models will have dual lens rear cameras, but the 4.7-inch 2017 iPhone will still have a single lens main camera.\n“We look for new 2017F iPhones to come in three models: one OLED model, and two TFTLCD models with 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch display,” Kuo wrote in a note seen by MacRumors . “We believe the OLED and 5.5-inch TFTLCD iPhones will feature dual-camera. Based on this prediction, our forecast of dual camera adoption rate in new 2017F iPhone models is revised up from 30-40% to 65-75%. We view this increase as favoring Largan’s sales and profit momentum as it is the exclusive supplier of wide-angle and telephoto lens. It also bodes well for Apple’s dual camera software ecosystem.”\nApple is also rumored to be removing the home button from the iPhone next year and placing the fingerprint sensor under the screen, in what will almost be an all-screen iPhone design. Kuo did not address the iPhone 8's design in this new report.\nTrending right now:\nBest Buy Black Friday 2016 ad: iPhone 7, PS4 Pro bundle, TVs, and other huge deals Best Buy just released a brand new Black Friday ad: Here’s what changed New performance tests show just how dominant the iPhone 7 really is See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "Home / News / Gadget News / Apple releases actual book, starting from $199 Apple releases actual book, starting from $199 \nby Sean Keach Read Comments \nIn what is unquestionably one of the most nauseating acts of self-importance that TrustedReviews has ever seen, Apple has released a (very expensive) book celebrating 20 years of its own designs. \nThe book, aptly named ‘Designed by Apple in California’, covers products from the iMac (1998) to the Apple Pencil (2015), with plenty of iPhones in between. There are 450 photographs of past and current Apple products in total, as well as notes on the materials and techniques used by Apple’s design team. \nSpeaking about what is effectively a catalogue of his own doodles-made-real, Apple’s Chief Design Officer Jony Ive said: “ This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years.” \nHe continued: “We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.” \nWhile Ive’s “gentle gathering” sounds great (read: totally sickening), the real kicker is the pricing: Apple’s book comes in two versions, with ‘Small’ starting at $199 and ‘Large’ pricing from $299. The small version is 10.20 x 12.75-inches, while its bigger brother is 13 x 16.15-inches. \nFortunately, the book comes with a flowery preamble from Ive himself, which may soften the $299 purchase you just transacted amidst the throes of Apple Store ecstasy. We hate spoilers at TrustedReviews , but if you’re feeling especially naughty, here’s an excerpt to mull over: \n“While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations, and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.” \nIve added: “We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative.” \nRight... \nIf you’re desperate to get your hands on the ‘Designed by Apple in California’ book, which is a shoo-in for the ‘most lazily named object’ award, you can buy it from Wednesday, November 16, in the following countries online: “UK, US, Australia, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Japan, Korea, Taiwan.\" \nThis article is called 'Written by Sean Keach in London’. Accepting $299 donations via PayPal. There’s no rational alternative. \nRelated: iPhone 8 \nWatch: iPhone 7 Plus video review \nHave you called in sick today so you can fondle the Apple book?

      "text": "Modal Trigger \nBaby got peach back. \nIn October, Apple released a batch of redesigned emojis for its iOS 10.2 software. The 72 new emojis included an astronaut, a face palm and the long-awaited avocado. \nBut to the dismay of iPhone owners, the updated emojis included a revamped peach that looked more like a fruit — and less like a butt. \nIn the era of the Kardashians, the peach emoji became a cheeky (pun intended) icon for the derrière and a go-to for sexting. \nSocial media erupted with disbelief. “Hey @Apple BRING BACK THE PEACH BUTT EMOJI OR RIOT!” @BadwoldTX tweeted. \nAnd TechCrunch contributor Devin Coldewey wrote an ode to the peach butt, wondering why Apple would replace something if it’s not better than the original. \nLuckily, the nation’s sexting disaster is over. Apple released a new beta version of iOS 10.2 to developers on Nov. 14, and the peach butt emoji was restored to its former glory. \nThe emoji will be included in the final version of the operating system, expected to be released in the next few weeks.

      "text": "The China Consumers Association (CCA) has asked Apple to investigate \"a considerable number\" of reports by users of iPhone 6 and 6s phones that the devices have been shutting off and cannot be turned back on again, it said on Tuesday.\nThe reported problems specifically involve users seeing their iPhones automatically shut off despite 50-60 percent battery levels, and the involuntary shutting off in room temperature or colder environments, as well as the inability to turn the cellphone back on despite continuous battery charging, the statement said.\n\"In view that Apple iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s series cellphones in China have a considerable number of users, and the number of people who've reported this problem is rather many, China Consumer Association has already made a query with Apple,\" the association said in a statement on its website.\nApple did not respond to a request for comment when contacted outside regular hours on Tuesday.\nIn September Apple's rival phone maker Samsung Electronics Co announced a global recall of at least 2.5 million of its flagship Note 7 smartphones due to faulty batteries causing some phones to catch fire.",

      "text": "News in brief Apple to develop iPhone connected digital glasses? \nApple is looking at developing digital glasses connected wirelessly to a wearer’s iPhone, which would show images and other information in the wearer’s field of vision and may use augmented reality, a report in Bloomberg suggests. Apple has talked about its glasses project with potential suppliers, according to people familiar with those discussions, the report adds. Should Apple ultimately decide to proceed with the device, it would be introduced in 2018 at the earliest. Filed by Christopher Brown   09:25 • Last updated 15 November 2016, 17:25",

It took eight years to develop, is bound in white linen, and printed on “specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges.” You really can’t help but hear the description in Jony Ive’s voice. \nThe book, conceived of and published by Apple, is a glossy $300 (that’s for the plus size; it’s $200 for a smaller version) tribute to the last 20 years of the company’s industrial design legacy, and to its progenitor, Steve Jobs. Photographer Andrew Zuckerman shot the 450 pages of products in Apple’s signature stark style—white background, high saturation—even turning the messy act of prototyping into minimalist glamour shots. \nDesigned By Apple is filled with images of the candy-colored Macbook, iPhone, and Apple Watch. More interestingly, it also documents how those things get made. Zuckerman turned his camera on the tools and prototypes, creating what reads like a visual masterclass in what it takes to bring a well-designed gadget to life. “The design studio really is a workshop. We design three-dimensional objects, and we make lots and lots of models and prototypes,” Ive says in a video. “Designing and making really should be inseparable. For every finished product you see, tools had to be designed, processes had to be created and experimented with.” \nBut in the book’s foreword, Ive characterizes the book as more than a documentation of process and object: \nWhile this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say. We strive, with varying degrees of success, to define objects that appear effortless. Objects that appear so simple, coherent and inevitable that there could be no rational alternative. \nYes, it’s a grandiose-sounding thing to say. Designed By Apple really is, after all, a book filled with pretty pictures of pretty objects. But Ive’s got a point. Apple’s design has always spoken for itself—now there’s a book to remind you of that.",

      "text": "Last Updated: NOV 16, 2016 New Delhi Email Author \nApple has a new product out there. And it's unlike anything else that the company launched earlier. It is neither an iPhone nor an iPad. The company's new product is a hardcover book with 450 photos showcasing its 20 years of products. The book will be sold through the Apple store on the web as well as its stores in the US at a price of $300. \nThe cover of the book reads Designed by Apple in California and is dedicated to the company's co-founder Steve Jobs who passed away in year 2011 due to Pancreatic cancer. The book has no texts inside. It is a collection of 450 photos shot by photographer Andrew Zuckerman, showcasing the Apple's design process as well as its finished products. The photo journey starts from Apple's iMac launched in 1998. The last photo is of the Apple Pencil which came in 2015.

We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.\" \nIn the book's foreword, Ive writes: \"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are. It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals.\" \nThe book is printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight colour separations and low-ghost ink. Designed by Apple in California will be available in two sizes: The smaller one (10.20\" x 12.75\") costs $199 while the larger (13\" x 16.25\") one will come at a price of $299.

      "text": "Apple's newest product is, gasp, a book. Yes, on paper. And it's $300. Eli Blumenthal , USA TODAY , KING 1:06 AM. PST November 16, 2016 The original iPhone in Apple's new \"Designed by Apple in California\" photo book. (Photo: Apple) \nLooking for a new Apple product this holiday season for the Apple fan in your life? Want to keep the spending under the price of a new Apple Watch, iPhone, iPad or MacBook? \nIt isn't a gadget. It's a photo book. \nTaking its name from the phrase found on every Apple product, “Designed by Apple in California” is perfect for the Apple lover. As with most Apple products, it will be available in two sizes: a \"small\" for $199 and a \"large\" version for $299. Both will feature linen-bound hardcovers with the pages \"printed on specially milled, custom-dyed paper with gilded matte silver edges, using eight color separations and low-ghost ink.\" \nThere does not appear to be the option to buy the book in \"rose gold\" or \"jet black.\" \nThe goal of the Apple-published book is to chronicle the company's past 20 years of product design, from 1998’s iMac to 2015’s Apple Pencil. There are 450 photographs of past and present Apple devices as well as photos that document the company's design process and techniques. \nApple dedicated the book to its late founder, Steve Jobs. \n\"While this is a design book, it is not about the design team, the creative process or product development. It is an objective representation of our work that, ironically, describes who we are,\" writes Jony Ive, Apple's chief design officer in the book's foreword. \n\"It describes how we work, our values, our preoccupations and our goals. We have always hoped to be defined by what we do rather than by what we say.\" \nThe iPhone-maker will begin selling the book tomorrow, November 16, on Apple.com and in various, but not all, Apple Stores around the world. Those who don't want to spend hundreds of dollars can check out the book at one of those locations, free of charge. \nCopyright 2016 KING ",

      "text": "Are ‘Smart Glasses’ Apple's Next Big Project? CEO Tim Cook Says Augmented Reality One Of Apple's ‘Area Of Focus’ By John Ventura , Parent Herald November 16, 09:25 am The Cupertino based tech firm is looking to expand is wearable portfolio by adding Smart Glasses in the mix. (Photo : Eric Thayer/Getty Images) \nWhat's next for Apple? So far, the company has left an indelible mark in our digital lives. From the iPhone to the iPad to the Mac and MacBook, Cupertino seems to have something to offer to make communication, entertainment and work better and easier. Now, Apple is taking the next big step: Smart Wearable. Advertisement \nOne source familiar with the matter reported that Apple is mulling on developing a pair of Smart glasses. Insiders say that the project, although it is still in its \"exploration phase\", will connect to any Apple iPhone wirelessly and should display several information on the user's field of vision. These include notifications, distance, images, and even \"use augmented reality\". \nThe website added that Apple has reached out to several \"potential suppliers\" about their new Smart Wearable that will augment the Apple Watch in the future. Further, it's been said that Apple has already ordered a few \"near-eye displays\" from one of its suppliers for testing. This, however, is not a sign that Apple is already thinking of mass-producing the Smart glasses soon. \nIn a July earnings call, Apple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook considered Augmented Reality, or AR, to be one of Apple's \"area of focus\". After one audience detailed the success of AR-based game Pokemon Go, Cook said that they are \"high on AR\", and that they have been and will continue to take interest and invest on the technology. He added that they are making sure their products \"work well\" with developers - a sight evident in players using iPhones while \"chasing pokey mans.\" \nApple needs to be ready to take the plunge and take head on the consequences of their Smart Glasses project. For now, it's a dark horse with a potential to boom over everyone. Still, it also comes with a self-contained bomb ready to explode in front of Apple's face. But then again, Apple and its fans are taking the news with a grain of salt: there will be questions at first, but answers will be found in the long run.   Related Articles",

Learn more... \nWed, Nov 16, 2016, 11:42 PM SGT - Singapore Markets closed Taiwan to ask for removal of Uber apps from Apple, Google app stores Reuters – 4 hours ago 783.01 +7.85 \nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. \nUber operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. \nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. \nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. \nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. \nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. \nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. \nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. \nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. \n(Reporting by J.R.

Learn more... \nWed, Nov 16, 2016, 11:42 PM SGT - Singapore Markets closed Taiwan to ask for removal of Uber apps from Apple, Google app stores Reuters – 5 hours ago View Photo \nA photo illustration shows the Uber app logo displayed on a mobile telephone, as it is held up for a posed photograph in central London, Britain October … \nTAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan plans to ask Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Alphabet Inc's (GOOGL.O) Google to pull apps of Uber Technologies available in Taiwan on their app stores, a government official said, upping pressure on the ride-hailing firm that is locked in a dispute with the island. \nUber [UBER.UL] operates in Taiwan as an internet-based technology platform rather than a transportation company, which Taiwanese authorities have said is a mis-representation of its service and has ordered it to pay back taxes. \nHowever, Uber has said it is communicating with Taiwan authorities and complies with local regulations. \n\"Uber has not done what it says it will do, so we are looking at another way by requesting its apps be removed from Apple and Google (app stores),\" Liang Guo-guo, a spokesman for Taiwan's Directorate General of Highways, which is handling the matter, told Reuters by phone on Wednesday. \nLiang said the request would include the removal of UberEATS app, which Uber launched in Taiwan on Tuesday as part of its effort to expand beyond its core taxi-hailing business around the world. \nIt is unclear if the move would succeed in hampering Uber in Taiwan as removing the app would not prevent alternative ways to download it. It is also not clear how apps that have already been downloaded by users will be dealt with. \nUber and Apple did not immediately respond with comments. \nA Google spokesperson pointed to policies on Google Play, its app store, which indicate that the company does not allow apps that facilitate or promote illegal activities, but declined to comment further. \nTaiwan transport authorities have begun penalizing UberEATS by fining motorcyclists who deliver the takeaways and suspending vehicle licenses for two to six months, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a statement issued on Tuesday. \nUber has been facing similar legal scrutiny in markets across Asia. It entered the Taiwan market in 2013, and its growing popularity has triggered anger from domestic taxi drivers, who staged a massive protest against Uber earlier this year. \n(Reporting by J.R.

      "text": "Conventional wisdom has it that when a band releases a greatest-hits album, it’s a tacit admission that their best days are behind them. There may be a second wind in the future, once the guitarist has gone off to a commune and found religion, the singer’s recorded a weird side-project with an experimental artist, and the third drummer’s died in a freak llama accident, but for now, don’t expect a return to those dizzying heights.\nOn an unrelated note, Apple has released a $300 book full of pictures of all its great products.\nThe book, titled Designed by Apple in California, is available in two sizes, big and very big, and contains 450 pictures of products from 20 years of the company’s history. The project comes with a foreword from Apple’s chief design officer, Jony Ive, was shot by the photographer Andrew Zuckerman, and is dedicated to the memory of Steve Jobs. \n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An Apple Watch in Apple’s book. Photograph: Apple \n“This archive is intended to be a gentle gathering of many of the products the team has designed over the years,” said Ive, not elaborating on what a “gentle gathering of products” is. “We hope it brings some understanding to how and why they exist, while serving as a resource for students of all design disciplines.”\nIve was so devoted to the book that he ended up leading the development of a custom form of paper, because normal paper apparently doesn’t work for printing all of the white objects Apple makes. “There were a few things we needed to do to accurately and objectively portray these products,” he told Wallpaper magazine. “Of course, many of these products are white, so the off-the-shelf printing processes really didn’t do an adequate job in describing the colour and surface of those products. Unsurprisingly, we ended up developing custom forms of paper and custom inks.”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest An iPhone in Apple’s book. Photograph: Apple \nNow that the greatest-hits book is released, Ive should have time to more fully devote himself to his other side-projects. This year alone, he has designed a fancy Christmas tree for Claridges with longtime collaborator Marc Newson, learned how to make things out of ceramic for the latest version of the Apple Watch (the iteration of Ive’s last passion project, the gold Apple Watch Edition), and developed “a whole new nine-step process” for making one version of the iPhone 7 extra shiny.\nWith all that work, it’s no wonder he hasn’t had time to figure out how to get rid of the unsightly camera nubbin on iPhones and iPads. Maybe Ive just needs to relax in a commune for a bit, to get his head back in the game. Steer clear of the llamas, though.",

      "text": "Manhattan DA's office says it has 423 uncracked Apple devices in evidence room By Wednesday, November 16, 2016, 08:35 am PT (11:35 am ET) The Manhattan district attorney's office now has 423 uncrackable devices in its evidence room, all of them Apple products running iOS 8 or later, according to a new report. Of these, the iPhone 6 is the most common by model with 166 units, Fortune said in a profile of the office's new digital crime lab, quoting official numbers. The 6 Plus ranks a distant second at 66, followed by the iPhone 6s (63). Distribution skews largely towards iPhones made in the last two years —in fact the office has just a single uncracked iPhone 4S. Also in storage are 30 uncracked iPads, though the DA's office didn't identify these by model. The largest share of the devices, 36 percent, were seized in cases involving electronic crimes and/or identity theft. 24 percent are connected to drug investigations, while much smaller numbers are related to charges like assault, murder, or sex crimes. As recently as Sept. 2015, the office had less than 100 uncrackable iOS devices. An unexplained surge appears to have taken place between November and December of that year. iOS 8, 9, and 10 all offer full-disk encryption, making it nearly impossible for anyone —including Apple —to access data on a device without its owner supplying the passcode. On products with Touch ID the situation is even more complex —while a person can potentially be compelled to supply their fingerprint, there's a limited time window in which to do so, and physical hacks may run into problems with the Secure Enclave. DA Cyrus Vance has been an outspoken critic of Apple's encryption policies. While Apple has maintained that people have a right to privacy, and that strong encryption safeguards both against hackers and state surveillance, Vance has complained that this is really just a marketing ploy and interfering with legitimate investigations. The attorney has called on the U.S. Congress to legislate decryption on demand , though mandatory backdoors have so far been shot down in the legal arena. Topics:",

      "text": "The iPhone isn't cheap. Not even close. Apple's phones have been setting the bar for high-end smartphone pricing for years, though. Apple has also been improving the iPhone without changing the price, which is a good thing. The simplest example concerns memory. In 2014, Apple upgraded its storage tiers without changing the iPhone 6’s price. It did the same this year with the iPhone 7, though the iPhone 7 Plus did get a bit more expensive because of the new dual camera and the added RAM.\nAre you upset about the iPhone 7 Plus price hike despite the added benefits? If so, we have some bad news: Donald Trump may make the iPhone more expensive than ever if he moves forward with his trade plans for China.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nSam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new NES Classic Edition review: A box of nostalgia ",

      "text": "Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and Apple's ( AAPL ) recent London investments mask a deeper concern for the city's future as a global tech hub as the government grapples with Brexit and rivals in Europe and Asia attempt to lure talent.\nGoogle's plans to build a new London HQ in the city's King's Cross district and add 3,000 new jobs has been seized by the British government as a validation for its post-Brexit future. The move follows Apple's decision to shift 1,400 of its staff to London's Battersea Power Station, best-known as the photographic backdrop to the famous Pink Floyd album \"Animals\". Amazon ( AMZN ) also appears committed to its new east London office in Shoreditch in an area known as 'Silicon Roundabout'.\nBut in a fast-paced technology industry where speed matters, some say Brexit confusion - a leaked memo Tuesday accused the government of having \"no overall strategy\" for leaving the EU - has complicated re-location and investment plans.\nA survey conducted by London's Magister Advisors showed that a non-U.K. software company placed 100 engineers in Germany rather than Britain immediately following the June 23 referendum and a fintech company decided in August to shift dozens of jobs to Dublin.\n\"I reckon people will be making decisions during next year,\" said Magister's MD Victor Basta. \"These companies are growing 50% a year. You can't tolerate three years of uncertainty. If there is a degree of uncertainty by late next year, it will force a bunch of people to make decisions they otherwise didn't have to make.\"",

      "text": "Share This Tweet This \nTech industry experts reported that the Apple might have two more smartphones lined up for 2017, both the phones will feature with curved and border-less designs. \nAnalysts from Barclays Research said that the tech giant company is looking to discard the traditional design for its upcoming 5\" and 5.8\" iPhone units. \nWhile the design of iPhone 8 is not yet confirmed the analysts believe that it could feature a bezel-less look with curved edges with a larger display compared with the original iPhone design. Advertisement \nAccording to a report in Tech Times , the 5.8'' iPhone will be the only one which offers OLED display feature, which will give a sharper and brighter screen to the phone. This will also allow the new handset to have a more energy efficient display compared to the earlier ones. \nRumors says iPhone 8 would have no Home button unlike all the iPhone series, the new iPhone 8 can come with glass casing and curved OLED screen in 2017. \nAs per a report in News Everyday , Robert Scoble said that the iPhone 8 and 8 plus will have a clear glass case, which will give a very shine any crystal clear look to the phone, and this would be made from Gorilla Glass combined with poly-carbonates for better durability of the smartphone. \nIt was reported before, that Samsung and LG were tapped to supply OLEDs to Apple for one year, then to be joined by Foxconn-owned Sharp by the end of 2017. Advertisement \nThe Rumors also suggest that the company's upcoming handset will share a number of designs similar with Xiaomi's Mi Combine, which will features a slight bezel look on the backside of the unit. \nBut all these are still a speculation from different researchers and analysits, it's better to wait for the Apple launch event and let them disclose the features of upcoming Apple iPhone 8. \n",

Richard Drew/AP View Caption of \nApple Inc. is rumored to be exploring an avenue into developing digital glasses, a risky venture into augmented reality that could yield a big payoff for the company if it’s successful. \nPast forays into AR have seen companies come up short and shift their focus to virtual reality projects. While Google has attempted to tackle the technology in 2013 with its own Google Glass, the project ultimately failed, succumbing to low battery life, an unattractive design, and privacy backlash. To succeed in the market, Apple will have to create a sleek design that allows users to access what the company has to offer. \nStepping into the less-charted market of wearable technology isn’t the safest of moves. But if Apple can roll out a product that fills the gaps Google Glass left, it could become a leader in AR. Recommended: 40 iPhone tips and tricks everyone should know \nStill, developing that technology “ is going to take a while , because there are some really hard technology challenges there, but it will happen in a big way, and we will wonder when it does, how we ever lived without it,” Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook said last month, Bloomberg reported. “Like we wonder how we lived without our phone today.\" Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/16 \nSources close to the project told Bloomberg that the device would connect to iPhones wirelessly to reveal images and information in the glasses’ lenses. The devices, which could also use AR, remain in a developmental and experimental phase, and Apple has not yet ordered enough parts to indicate that they’re ready to begin producing the product for commercial sale. \nEven with a renewed vision for the product, it’s hard to say whether Apple can surpass Google’s clumsy endeavor. Chips, batteries, and other parts needed to build the glasses might still be too large and bulky to create a better design than Google Glass. While VR headsets have entered the market, along with a HoloLens AR product from Microsoft, many companies have hit a wall when it comes to developing sophisticated and practical AR technologies. \nBut another, more surprising company has announced a foray into the field as well : Snap Inc., the creator of Snapchat,. The company debuted “Spectacles,” a pair of sunglasses capable of capturing short videos, in September. The more stylish, and less expensive glasses – with a ticket price of $129.99 compared to Google Glass’s $1,500 – have made the technology more appealing and attainable recently. \nThe soonest Apple could unveil its own glasses would be in 2018, sources say. Still, some don’t believe Apple has the capacity to become a leader in the technology, and question what role the company will play in charting new routes in the future. \n“Apple has a track record of taking not-entirely-original and niche ideas and transforming them into something grander ,” Shira Ovide wrote in an op-ed for Livemint. “We might look back at 2016 as a lull before a storm of ground-breaking product categories. More likely, though, Apple’s days as technology’s unrivaled innovation factory are over.” Next up ",

      "text": "Jailbreak iOS 10 Latest News & Update: Pangu Finally Releases iOS 10 Jailbreak; Apple Completely Unhappy By Andrew Rutherford   06:03 pm Jailbreak iOS 10 is coming and fans are excited.(Photo : iCrackUriDevice/YouTube) \nGood news for jailbreaking fans as iOS 10 will be mostly available to Apple users in December. Fans were mostly disappointed as there is no concrete jailbreak on iOS 10, however, with the latest development made by Pangu, there may be hope soon. Advertisement \nReports are also indicating that iOS 10.2 is now in its beta phase and that it will mostly concentrate fixing bugs and adding new features. According to Neurogadget, Pangu will be releasing its iOS 10 jailbreak to Apple users as soon after the iOS 10.2 is released by Apple to the public. \nWhile Pangu was able to jailbreak Apple's iOS 9.3, Apple claims that iOS 10 is its most secured operating system at the moment. Pangu has not commented if it indeed created a jailbreak for iOS 10 but if it did, Apple will really be disappointed. \nRedmonpie reported the following developers who claimed to have successfully jailbreak iOS 10.1.1 on iPhone 7, also the iOS 10.2 for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch. As of this time, Apple has also stopped signing iOS 10.0.2 and 10.0.3 which would indicate that they will be ready for its official release soon enough. \nApple recently released iOS 10.1 to patch some software bugs and to introduce its new Camera Portrait mode for iPhone and iPad users, however, the new software may have also allowed other developers to run jailbreak extensions. A video from YouTube that is garnering a lot of attention is from @ijapija00 who showed off his jailbreaking experience. \nMost Apple users are also skeptical if they could really use the tutorial video meant to free iOS 10. However, avid Apple owners are just relying on Apple's promise of a December launch for most of the features meant for iOS 10.2. \nIt will not be that long before Apple officially release iOS 10 to the public but it could be seen that Pangu may still have some time to give us its jailbreak version for iOS 10.",

      "text": "print \nApple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nApple is integrating augmented reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. \nThe effort, which involves teams from several acquired startups, reflects Apple’s near-term desire to put augmented reality technology into consumers' hands even as it develops special glasses that could eventually change the way people perceive their surroundings. \nApple also recently hired an expert in head-mounted displays, in the latest sign of its longer-term glasses initiative. \nAugmented reality is an exploding field in technology in which digital objects are superimposed onto the real world. A view of a city street for instance can be enriched with a map for directions, a coupon for a nearby store or an animated character in a video game. \nThe ultimate goal is a pair of smart glasses, and companies including Google, Microsoft, Facebook , Apple and Snapchat are all actively developing or exploring such a product. But in the near-term most popular augmented reality applications will take place on a smartphone, as was the case with this summer’s smash hit Pokemon Go app . Point and recognize \nBy adding AR technology into the iPhone’s camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognized, according to the person familiar with the matter. That would require creating or licensing a database of 3D objects. \nAnother early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognize and manipulate people's faces. Apple integrated facial recognition technology into the photos app in the most recent version of its iOS software, and purchased FaceShift, a company with similar technology in 2015. \nApple has acquired several AR and virtual reality technology companies in recent years including Metaio, in February 2014 and Flyby Media in January 2016. The employees from both groups are now working in Apple’s camera group. \nEventually, the person said, after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers, like it did with its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. At that point, Apple will become a competitor to companies like Vuforia and Blippar. \nApple declined to comment. \nSeveral leaders in the augmented reality space have previously said they expect Apple to integrate AR into the next version of iOS. Glass backward \nODG \nApple is also working on a pair of skinny, stylish smart glasses that pairs to an iPhone to display contextual information, Bloomberg reported on Monday and sources have told Business Insider. \nHowever, the timeline for the device is far into the future — 2018 or later, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut there are some signs that the project has moved out of the exploration labs and into a more advanced stage in which Apple is exploring production. \nJohn Border, who lists his title as \"senior optics manufacturing exploration engineer,\" joined Apple in September, according to his LinkedIn profile. Border's bio describes him as a \" subject matter expert in the fields of head-worn displays, plastic optics manufacturing, camera systems and image sensors.\" \nBefore joining Apple, he was chief engineer at Osterhout Design Group, a small 50-person company based in San Francisco. \nODG is notable as one of the few companies currently demoing a fully functional pair of smart glasses. ODG sells a device called the R-7 Smartglasses that uses \"3D stereoscopic ultra-transparent see-thru HD displays\" to superimpose computer graphics into the real world. \nTake a look at their tech for yourself: \nIf you know anything about Apple's AR project, email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com.

      "title": "Public Access - The New Macbook Pro: a Closer Look",
      "text": "Share Save \nOn October 27, 2016, Apple revealed the first significant redesign of its flagship MacBook Pro notebook in four years. The 2016 MacBook Pro greatly improves the processing power, graphics capabilities and battery life of the previous model -- but those aren't the features that have people talking. Apple has also made the new MacBook Pro thinner and lighter than ever -- and they've created an entirely new way of interacting with your computer. MacBook Pro Touch Bar If you frequently work with applications that use complicated command sets, you're going to love the new MacBook Pro Touch Bar. The Touch Bar is a touch-sensitive display positioned just above the keyboard. It is long, narrow and just as responsive as an iPhone's screen. It has the ability to display virtually anything depending on what you're currently doing with your computer. When you launch a supported application, the Touch Bar will automatically change to give you fast access to the application's most common functions. These are just a few of the MacOS applications that support the Touch Bar or will support it before the end of 2016: Adobe Photoshop Skype Pixelmator You can also expect your Mac's built-in applications to support the Touch Bar. Safari, Finder, Final Cut Pro, iTunes and FaceTime all have specific Touch Bar functions. If the developer hasn't added Touch Bar support to your favorite application yet, you can create Touch Bar buttons yourself using the \"Customize Touch Bar\" option under the \"View\" menu. Note, though, that the developer does need to enable the \"Customize Touch Bar\" functionality for this method to work. Other Features of the 2016 MacBook Pro USB-C Only The new MacBook Pro omits all standard USB ports in favor of smaller and faster USB-C ports. If you require standard USB, HDMI or Thunderbolt connections, you'll need a USB-C adapter. You can also use any of the MacBook Pro's USB-C ports to charge the computer's battery. Touch ID At the far right side of the MacBook Pro Touch Bar is a new Touch ID fingerprint sensor. The Touch ID sensor uses advanced imaging techniques to scan your fingerprint and store it temporarily in a secure enclave for analysis. You can use the Touch ID sensor as a replacement for website passwords or to log in to your computer. Apple has also integrated the Touch ID sensor with Apple Pay, allowing you to pay for online purchases simply by scanning your finger. Butterfly Keyboard Computer manufacturers must constantly adapt their notebook computer designs to satisfy consumer demand for thinner and lighter machines. Today, most notebook computers use \"scissor\" mechanisms under the keys. If you accidentally press the edge of a key, the keystroke may not register. The new MacBook Pro features a \"butterfly\" mechanism that keeps each key more stable and registers edge presses more accurately. If you type frequently, the MacBook Pro keyboard may significantly improve your typing speed and accuracy. 0 Shares ",

      "text": "print Apple CEO Tim Cook. REUTERS/Toru Hanai \nApple is integrating augmented reality technology into the iPhone’s camera app, a person familiar with the matter told Business Insider. \nThe effort, which involves teams from several acquired startups, reflects Apple’s near-term desire to put augmented reality technology into consumers' hands even as it develops special glasses that could eventually change the way people perceive their surroundings. \nApple also recently hired an expert in head-mounted displays, in the latest sign of its longer-term glasses initiative. \nAugmented reality is an exploding field in technology in which digital objects are superimposed onto the real world. A view of a city street for instance can be enriched with a map for directions, a coupon for a nearby store or an animated character in a video game. \nThe ultimate goal is a pair of smart glasses, and companies including Google, Microsoft, Facebook , Apple and Snapchat are all actively developing or exploring such a product. But in the near-term most popular augmented reality applications will take place on a smartphone, as was the case with this summer’s smash hit Pokemon Go app . Point and recognize \nBy adding AR technology into the iPhone’s camera software, Apple wants consumers to be able to point the phone at a real-world object and have it be recognized, according to the person familiar with the matter. That would require creating or licensing a database of 3D objects. \nAnother early feature for Apple's AR integration into the camera app could be to recognize and manipulate people's faces. Apple integrated facial recognition technology into the photos app in the most recent version of its iOS software, and purchased FaceShift, a company with similar technology in 2015. \nApple has acquired several AR and virtual reality technology companies in recent years including Metaio, in February 2014 and Flyby Media in January 2016. The employees from both groups are now working in Apple’s camera group. \nEventually, the person said, after the AR features are built into the iPhone camera app, Apple will release the technology behind them as an SDK for app developers, like it did with its Touch ID fingerprint sensor. At that point, Apple will become a competitor to companies like Vuforia and Blippar. \nApple declined to comment. \nSeveral leaders in the augmented reality space have previously said they expect Apple to integrate AR into the next version of iOS. Glass backward \nODG Apple is also working on a pair of skinny, stylish smart glasses that pairs to an iPhone to display contextual information, Bloomberg reported on Monday and sources have told Business Insider. \nHowever, the timeline for the device is far into the future — 2018 or later, according to the Bloomberg report. \nBut there are some signs that the project has moved out of the exploration labs and into a more advanced stage in which Apple is exploring production. \nJohn Border, who lists his title as \"senior optics manufacturing exploration engineer,\" joined Apple in September, according to his LinkedIn profile. Border's bio describes him as a \" subject matter expert in the fields of head-worn displays, plastic optics manufacturing, camera systems and image sensors.\" \nBefore joining Apple, he was chief engineer at Osterhout Design Group, a small 50-person company based in San Francisco. \nODG is notable as one of the few companies currently demoing a fully functional pair of smart glasses. ODG sells a device called the R-7 Smartglasses that uses \"3D stereoscopic ultra-transparent see-thru HD displays\" to superimpose computer graphics into the real world. \nTake a look at their tech for yourself: \nIf you know anything about Apple's AR project, email the author at kleswing@businessinsider.com.

      "text": "How Donald Trump Could Save Apple, Inc. Billions   (Evan Niu, CFA) 4 min ago Image source: Apple. \nIt's been just over a week since Donald Trump won the general election, and investors are still trying to figure out what a Trump administration holds in store for their positions. That's much easier said than done, considering the fact that the president-elect hasn't been particularly forthright with detailed plans on any of his proposed policies. \nOne issue that Trump campaigned on was his support of alleviating taxes on repatriating cash, arguing that allowing corporations to bring funds home at favorable tax rates would translate into domestic investment that would in turn spur economic activity stateside. Of course, that was the argument for the last repatriation holiday in 2004, and most of the cash that companies brought back was promptly returned to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. There are valid arguments for and against a repatriation holiday, but most lawmakers are against repatriation holidays because the government ends up losing tax revenue over the long-term; the holidays simply encourage more profit shifting as companies just wait around hoping for the next repatriation holiday. \nTrump's site from his campaign calls for relief: \"It will provide a deemed repatriation of corporate profits held offshore at a one-time tax rate of 10 percent.\" This is a slightly higher rate than the 2004 holiday, which allowed companies to repatriate cash at 5.25%. It's worth noting that Trump's site after becoming president-elect does not include details on repatriation, so it's not clear where Trump currently stands on this issue. Key word: \"deemed\" \nYou may have noticed that I didn't refer to Trump's proposal as a \"holiday.\" It's a minor semantic distinction, but it's important. There are three broad ways that lawmakers have proposed dealing with foreign cash hoards, which now total approximately $2.6 trillion. There is a transition tax, a stand-alone deemed repatriation, or a repatriation tax holiday. Deemed repatriation is sort of a hybrid of the other two, so you could arguably apply \"holiday\" to deemed repatriation due to its one-time nature as well. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a nonpartisan research and policy institute, provides this handy table: Image source: CBPP . \nThe way that deemed repatriation would work is that the government would impose a one-time tax on all foreign profits that are currently being held overseas. The most important distinction is that unlike a pure holiday, which allows for optional repatriation, deemed repatriation is compulsory and the tax would be imposed regardless of whether or not companies actually brought that cash back. The U.S. government would be able to use the incoming revenue for things like infrastructure, but it doesn't guarantee that companies will actually repatriate cash. But if they're paying the tax anyway, many companies will probably choose to repatriate. How this could save Apple billions \nMuch digital ink has been spilled regarding Apple 's (NASDAQ: AAPL) massive and growing foreign reserves, which now stand at $216 billion. The Mac maker has long tapped the debt markets as a roundabout way to raise domestic cash while avoiding repatriation taxes, funds that it uses to pay dividends and repurchase stock. But that strategy has inherent limits, as Apple has now amassed nearly $80 billion in long-term debt . \nAt the same time, CEO Tim Cook has already stated that Apple is planning on repatriating a large chunk of cash as early as next year, noting that the company has \" provisioned several billion dollars \" for taxes without elaborating further. It seems that some level of repatriation is already on the table for Apple. Using Trump's proposed 10% deemed repatriation rate, Apple could be facing a one-time tax bill of $21.6 billion. That doesn't sound like savings, and whether or not Apple actually saved money depends on how much it was already planning on bringing home. \nHere are just some theoretical scenarios. \nAmount Repatriated",

      "text": "According to a new report from The Information , Apple over the last few months held talks with Chris Rock’s management team about bringing exclusive new material from the famed comedian to the Apple ecosystem. The negotiations ultimately fell through, with Netflix ultimately swooping in and signing Rock to a record-setting deal worth $40 million for two new specials.\nDON’T MISS: Walmart will give you a chance to buy the NES Classic every day this week\nAccording to the report, Apple is wary of getting into bidding wars with companies like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon over original content. Instead, Apple has curiously signaled its intention to sign off on content that no one is really excited about. In addition to a reality show based on app development, Apple this past July also purchased the rights to James Corden’s “Carpool Karoke” bit from late-night TV.\nIn effect, Apple’s strategy in the TV space isn’t much of a strategy at all, and as we highlighted just a few weeks ago, Apple’s lack of vision and leadership in this area is dumbfounding and embarrassing.\nAll the while, Apple seems more than happy to strike deals for exclusive launch windows for movies, such as Michael Moore’s upcoming documentary Trumpland .\nApple got the right to offer “TrumpLand” on iTunes earlier than other online video services, in exchange for prominently promoting it on the iTunes homepage, according to a person involved in the discussions. Having Apple’s promotional commitment is significant enough to help get a movie financed, this person said.\nOne would think that Apple would have learned by now, given its experience with Apple Music, that exclusive launch windows for content that can eventually be found elsewhere falls far short of being a competitive advantage.\nReading that Apple contemplated inking a deal with Chris Rock before letting the deal slip through its fingers is disappointing. There are few names in the entertainment industry capable of bringing in an avalanche of eyeballs. Chris Rock is one of those names, and the fact that Apple, a company not hurting for cash, is wary of getting into a bidding war for A-level content is indicative of a company with no real direction in the TV space.\nTrending right now:\nSam’s Club full Black Friday 2016 ad leaked: Here are the best deals Best Buy just released an updated Black Friday ad: Here’s what’s new Massive Pokemon Go December update will reportedly bring Pokemon trading and PvP battles See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "The iPhone 8 hit headlines even before the iPhone 7 was launched. After all, everyone is looking at the big overhaul that is expected next year as iPhone celebrates its 10th anniversary. One of the most talked about aspect of the device, that is almost a year away from its release, is its display that Apple plans to make more vibrant and less energy consuming with the OLED.\nHowever, a Bloomberg report points out that the four main suppliers don’t have the production capacity to produce the screens for the upcoming iPhone. People familiar with the matter also told the news site that these constraints could go on till 2018 making it a challenge for the Cupertino Company to out a device with OLED technology.\nSamsung Display, LG Display, Sharp Display and Japan Display are the four biggest suppliers, out of which Samsung is said to be the sole supplier for next year. However, the company alone cannot meet the requirements, the report adds. It’s Apple’s stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLEDs that lead to supply constraints, further adds the report.\nIf you remember Apple added the Retina display to the iPhone 4 back in 2014. With the iPhone 5 it increased the display size while the iPhone 6 got a new display variant. In 2017, most people are expecting an OLED panel that will bring an edge to edge display look. According to the report, the all new look will come with a virtual Home button rather than the physical button that is currently present.\nMeanwhile, rumour has it that Apple is expected to release a 4.7-inch iPhone 8 along with the standard 5.5-inch model and a new 5-inch model as well. There are also reports of Apple working with Biel and Lens Technologies, a Chinese company that supplies glass panels to Apple and Samsung.\nThe post Apple wants OLED in next iPhones, but suppliers not ready: Report appeared first on Tech2 .",

      "text": "Apple cider biscotti \n\nThese Apple Cider Biscotti are delicious and different. If you enjoy biscotti, you need to give these a try!\n\nI get so excited when I search for a recipe concept I have or something I made and it isn't \"out there\". These Apple Cider Biscotti fall into that area. If you enjoy Biscotti you need to make some of these for yourself. Then give some to a friend or a family member. They will love you a little extra for that! \nI love cookies...like really love cookies (homemade cookies that is)! I may blue and furry with jiggly eyes and go by the name of Cookie Monster in an alternate dimension, I wouldn't be surprised.\n\nIf you too are a cookie monster...check out my Cookie Board on Pinterest, or my all of my cookie recipes on my website .\nEnjoy!\nRecipe: \n&frac12; cup butter (1 stick, softened) 1 cup granulated sugar 2 eggs &frac14; cup, plus 1 TBS apple cider 3&frac14; cups all-purpose flour 2 teaspoons baking powder 1 teaspoons ground cinnamon A pinch of nutmeg &frac12; teaspoon salt Apple Cider Glaze \n1 cup powdered sugar 2 TBS apple cider (more if necessary) Pinch of cinnamon \nDirections: \nPreheat oven to 350 degrees. In a large bowl, combine butter, sugar, and eggs with a mixer (using a paddle attachment if you have one...if not no worries) for about 1 minute or until well blended. Mix in apple cider and and mix until just blended. In a separate bowl, combine flour, baking powder, nutmeg, and salt. Working in small batches, mix the flour mixture into butter mixture until all of the flour mixture has been added to the butter mixture and is well blended. Divide dough in half on a floured piece of parchment paper. Shape each dough-half into a long roll shape, about 12-14\" long. Carefully lift rolls onto a baking sheet, 3-4 inches apart from each other. With your fingers, press down on each \"log\" so that they end up being about a &frac12;\" high. Bake for 25 minutes or until golden brown. Carefully lift the parchment paper from the baking sheets and place on your cooling racks. Set aside your baking sheet, as you will use it again. When biscotti had cooled enough to handle, yet are still warm, carefully move them to a cutting board and cut crosswise slices (approximately &frac12;\" in size). Place slices, cut side down, back on original baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Then remove from oven and turn slices over. Bake for another 10 minutes or until somewhat firm and lightly browned. Transfer to wire racks to completely cool, with tops facing up. For Glaze \nIn a small bowl, mix together powdered sugar, apple cider and cinnamon. If needed, add more cider or powdered sugar to achieve desired consistency (you don't want it too runny, since you want it to firm up on the Biscotti). Glazing: \nSpace biscotti pieces no more than &frac12; inch or so apart from each other on either a wire rack or parchment paper (hello easy clean-up) dip a metal whisk into the glaze, allowing some of the excess to drip off. Then quickly drizzle back and forth, back and forth across sections of your Biscotti Continue until they are glazed as you like. You can also place glaze in a small plastic baggie, snip off one end and drizzle the glaze from there, your choice.\n\nThe post Apple Cider Biscotti appeared first on Souffle Bombay . ",

      "text": "0 A man use his iPad inside a local coffee shop in downtown Shanghai November 28, 2013. Reuters/Carlos Barria \nApple Inc. is exploring the possibility of expanding to smart glasses. The venture is considered tough but presents limitless possibilities. Smartglass is still in its developmental phase. The device will connect wirelessly to the user’s iPhone and facilitates images and Internet browsing. The company may use augmented reality for the purpose. \nApple has already ordered smartglasses in small numbers. But it has not acquired enough for mass production, according to Financial Post \nA must-have venture \nApple is under pressure to deliver something as the sale of iPhones slows down. And Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook expressed his excitement about augmented reality. The rise of Pokemon Go, a location-based game that uses the technology, had spawned great enthusiasm in the market. \nApple smartglass is expected to be its first venture into the hardware market aiming at Pokemon Go. \nThe challenges \nWith the launch of smartglasses, Apple will become the latest to enter the bandwagon. Alphabet had introduced the same in the past, but the company had to discontinue it due to privacy concerns. Snap also had launched a smartglass in 2012. However, users forced it out of the market because of its awkward appearance. When it combined with privacy concerns, the exit appeared faster than the company expected, reports Inverse . The device was a video-camera sunglass. \nThese disappointments forced tech companies to turn away from Ar. They began to focus more in virtual reality instead. Google came up with a VR headphone along with its Pixel smartphone. Facebook also has teamed up with Samsung for a similar endeavour. Microsoft has the most famous product at present. HoloLens lets users view holographic images in their fields of vision. \nExperts feel that launching smartglasses for Apple is going to be a difficult venture. Manufacturing small batteries powerful enough for virtual reality is almost impossible. Still, researchers feel that Apple might succeed in the long run. The company is known for the ability to turn technological advances into easy-to-use products.",

PHOTO: AFP Nov 17, 2016 12:52 PM \n[SAN FRANCESCO] Apple Inc has big plans to outfit its next iPhone with vibrant, energy-sipping organic LED displays, seeking to entice consumers with new technology that's already been embraced by other high-end smartphone makers. \nThe trouble is that the four main suppliers for such components won't have enough production capacity to make screens for all new iPhones next year, with constraints continuing into 2018, people familiar with the matter said, presenting a potential challenge for the Cupertino, California-based company. \nOLED screens are more difficult to produce, putting Apple at the mercy of suppliers that are still working to manufacture the displays in mass quantities, the people said. The four largest producers are Samsung Display Co, LG Display Co, Sharp Corp, and Japan Display Inc. While Samsung is on track to be the sole supplier for the new displays next year, the South Korean company may not be able to make enough due to low yield rates combined with increasing iPhone demand. \nThe supply constraints may force Apple to use OLED in just one version of the next-generation iPhone, push back adoption of the technology or cause other snags.\"Apple has already figured in there will be high demand for the OLED model and they've also figured out there will be constraints to these panels,\" said Dan Panzica, a supply chain analyst at IHS Markit. The combination of Apple's stringent quality requirements and the difficulty of producing OLED panels will likely lead to supply constraints, he said. \nApple plans to ship at least one new iPhone with an OLED screen next year, the 10th anniversary of the smartphone's debut, people with knowledge of the matter said. A pair of other new iPhone models will likely feature screens that use older LCD technology, partly because there won't be enough OLED displays to satisfy anticipated demand, according to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\"Display technology is still a pretty key driver of the purchasing experience,\" said Ben Bajarin, an analyst at Creative Strategies. Apple has previously used new display features as iPhone selling points. For example, the iPhone 4 in 2010 added Apple's first Retina Display, the iPhone 5 in 2012 introduced the iPhone's first display size increase, and the iPhone 6 in 2014 brought new 4.7-inch and 5.5-inch screen options. \nThe OLED iPhone, at least, will have a new look that extends glass from the display to the device's back and edges, according to a person familiar with Apple's plans. This all-glass design will have virtual Home button embedded in an edge-to-edge screen, rather than a physical button that can be pressed, the person added. \nAn Apple spokeswoman declined to comment. \nApple typically introduces new technologies for its iPhones across all models when they're unveiled every September, as it did for 3D Touch and Apple Pay. Using different core, user-facing technology in the same iPhone generation would be an unusual step. All current iPhone 7 models have LCD screens. Still, Apple may have no choice. \nSharp and Japan Display are still working on test procedures for OLED screens and have said that they are on track for production in 2018, while seeking to manage expectations. \nBLOOMBERG ",

      "text": "Apple isn't giving up on TV yet. Image source: Apple.\nIt's been about nine months since we first heard about Vital Signs , Apple 's ( NASDAQ:AAPL ) rumored foray into original TV content that would be based on hip-hop-artist-turned-Apple-executive Dr. Dre. We haven't heard much about the project since, but there have been various other headlines and rumors that form a mosaic around Apple's interest in original content.\nThere's no doubt that Apple has some interest here, but it's being incredibly noncommittal. Apple acquired the rights to an unscripted TV series based on Carpool Karaoke , months before CEO and Alabama-native Tim Cook serenaded attendees at Apple's September iPhone event with Sweet Home Alabama . That performance came just a couple months after services chief Eddy Cue told The Hollywood Reporter :\nWe're not in the business of trying to create TV shows. If we see it being complementary to the things we're doing at Apple Music or if we see it being something that's innovative on our platform, we may help them and guide them and make suggestions. But we're not trying to compete with Netflix ( NASDAQ:NFLX ) or compete with Comcast .\nCue's comments don't exactly line up with what Cook said last month on the earnings call:\nI would confirm that television has intense interest with me and many other people here. In terms of owning content and creating content, we have started with focusing on some original content, as you point out. We've got a few things going there that we've talked about. And I think it's a great opportunity for us both from a creation point of view and an ownership point of view. and so it's is an area that we're focused on.\nNow The Information is reporting that Apple had expressed interest in a video deal with Chris Rock, which didn't progress much. Netflix ended up scooping up the comedian for a $40 million deal . What in the world is even going on?\nMake up your mind, Apple If there's a lack of consistency between reported headlines and executive comments, that's probably because Apple doesn't even know how it wants to proceed here. TV has always been a hard nut to crack , and Apple has no easy solutions with modernizing the industry given how entrenched the value chain is.\nApple's TV ambitions stem from its long-standing strategy of using exclusive services as a differentiating factor to sell its hardware, and its track record doing so is mixed, with both successes and failures. There have been many reports of Apple trying to put together a slimmed-down TV bundle with just 25 channels, but Apple has never made meaningful progress negotiating with networks and cable operators, since it is essentially asking them all to disrupt themselves by embracing cord-cutting.\nApple's new TV app will be released later this year. Image source: Apple.\nThe Mac maker recently announced a new TV app that hopes to unify the viewing experience across all devices, aggregating content from a wide range of providers. The new TV app is just as notable for what it has as for what it lacks -- namely, Netflix and Amazon ( NASDAQ:AMZN ) . Omitting Amazon is expected, given the two companies' long-standing rivalry within services and utter unwillingness to collaborating on each other's platforms. But Netflix's exclusion is more peculiar, since it has always had a good relationship with Apple. Of course, Netflix has its own apps for Apple platforms, so it won't really be missing out.\nIf we wanted to really speculate, Apple's new TV app could be seen as a precursor for some type of TV service if and when Apple inks the necessary partnerships. But the secret sauce would always be original content as a differentiator. This is where it gets tricky.\nDon't do it, Tim Apple absolutely wants to continue growing its services business, which is now a nearly $25 billion business that's primarily built on non-recurring content purchases from iTunes and the App Store, as well as AppleCare and Apple Pay. Apple Music now has about 17 million subscribers, which annualizes into about $2 billion in revenue. As Apple continues to highlight recurring-revenue sources, a TV subscription service fits right in.\nBut original content is expensive -- Netflix just raised $1 billion in debt to fund its aggressive original content plans for 2017-- especially if you do it right. TV is an inherently fickle and unpredictable industry. No one knows what will be a hit and what will be a flop. At least 15 studios passed on Stranger Things , which proved to be a sleeper hit for Netflix that drove subscriber growth last quarter. Experimenting is a requisite, and that's why Netflix takes a broad approach. It's also why it costs so much. To build a compelling library of original content, you need to buy shows across a wide range of genres as well as localized content for certain geographies, and each risks being a flop. Netflix's subscriber numbers show that the video streamer is executing quite well, but video streaming is Netflix's core business.\nIt makes far less sense for Apple to put any meaningful amount of money toward building a library of original content with the hopes of building a TV service as a side business. Most importantly, can you imagine a customer buying an iPhone so they can subscribe to a hypothetical Apple TV service just so they can see exclusive original content? Me neither.",

      "text": "Apple's new high-end OLED 2017 iPhone expected to feature 5.1\"-5.2\" display By Thursday, November 17, 2016, 05:49 am PT (08:49 am ET) Apple is widely expected to introduce a new premium iPhone model in 2017 featuring an all-new design and OLED display, but the screen will be sized somewhere in between the current iPhone and iPhone Plus, according to one well-connected insider. \"iPhone 8\" concept by Veniamin Geskin. Analyst Ming-Chi Kuo of KGI Securities issued a research note on Thursday, a copy of which was obtained by AppleInsider , in which he claimed that Apple's OLED iPhone will feature a screen size of either 5.1 or 5.2 inches. It will be released alongside new iPhone models with traditional LCD panels sized at 4.7 and 5.5 inches. According to Kuo, Apple plans to buy flexible OLED panels from Samsung sized at 5.7 or 5.8 inches. But the actual active area on the flagship iPhone will be smaller, in the 5.1- to 5.2-inch range. The OLED iPhone will feature \"significant changes in form factor,\" Kuo said, and will boast specifications \"considerably better\" than the LCD models. This means that despite having a smaller screen than the 5.5-inch iPhone Plus model, the OLED version will be the most high-end model. Kuo still expects form factor modifications for the 4.7- and 5.5-inch versions. But the primary change will be a switch to a glass casing instead of metal, he said. Concept rendering of next-gen iPhone with edge-to-edge display. The analyst expects robust growth for iPhone shipments following the introduction of new designs in late 2017. He expects total shipments in fiscal 2017 will reach 220 million to 225 million units, versus 212 million units in 2016. A key concern appears to be supply of OLED panels— numerous reports have indicated that the availability of OLED displays could limit production of the new flagship model in 2017. Earlier this week, Kuo indicated that both the 5.5-inch Plus and slightly smaller OLED \"iPhone 8\" will feature dual-camera systems . But it is not expected that the 2017 4.7-inch \"iPhone 7s\" will gain a second camera, as was introduced on the iPhone 7 Plus. The flagship OLED iPhone is believed to celebrate the 10th anniversary of Apple's revolutionary handset. Reports have suggested the design shakeup will enable Apple to embed key features— including the FaceTime camera, earpiece and Touch ID fingerprint sensor —beneath the display, boasting a truly seamless edge-to-edge design.
