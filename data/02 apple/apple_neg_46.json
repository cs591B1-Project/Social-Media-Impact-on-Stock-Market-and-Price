      "text": "print Apple AirPods are displayed during a media event in San Francisco Thomson Reuters \nApple's first pair of truly wireless headphones, called AirPods, were supposed to go on sale in late October but were indefinitely delayed at the end of that month. \nNow Apple CEO Tim Cook has weighed in, via an email to a customer published on Wednesday by MacRumors . He wrote: \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay---we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\" \nMacRumors says the email looks legitimate, although it's possible it could be faked. \nAirPods have been hotly anticipated since Apple revealed them alongside the iPhone 7, which doesn't have a headphone jack. The $159 wireless headphones were positioned as the obvious next-generation fix, but many are now worried that the devices will miss the all-important holiday season. \nCook didn't say whether they'd be on sale during Christmas, but \"next few weeks\" suggests that they're coming soon. \nSo if you want a pair of AirPods, just hold on! Cook says they're coming.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "3 Comments Sometimes a gift just doesn't land as well as you want it to. \nSometimes, you accidentally get a blue iPhone case instead of a red one, or a bag for an 11-inch MacBook Air instead of a 13-inch MacBook Pro, or an iPad Air 2 instead of an iPad Pro. Whatever the case, it's a simple matter to return or exchange the wrong gifts and make sure you end up with the right ones. First, the rules \nNormally, the Apple Store — online and retail — offers a 14-day return policy on any item sold. For the holidays, the company has expanded this window: If an item was purchased between November 10 and December 25, 2016 you have until January 8, 2017 to return or exchange it. \nThere's no fee to return a hardware gift, even if it's been opened, but Apple does ask that you include all cords, adapters, manuals, and the like in the original packaging. \nThere are a few things you can't return, including opened software, electronic software downloads from the App Store, Apple Store gift cards, Apple Developer products, and print products (cards, calendars, and books made with iPhoto). \nIf you purchased an iPhone for a family member and want to return it, do note that returning the device may not reset your carrier service contract; you may have to call your carrier if you want to cancel the line or reset your upgrade eligibility. How to return or exchange your gift at the Apple Store \nTo return or exchange an Apple Store gift, just bring it to any Apple Store and chat with an Apple Specialist. If you're returning the gift, not the recipient, you can get the balance refunded directly to your card. If your family member or friend is returning the gift, they can either get an Apple Store gift card for the amount of the item or exchange it for another product within the store. How to return or exchange your gift via the Apple.com store \nIf you or your recipient live too far away from an Apple retail store, they can return the item via Apple.com. Here's how to do so: Click or tap on the Bag icon in the upper right corner of the screen. Select Account . Click on Return Items . \nSelect Gift Return . \nYou'll need to enter either the product's serial number or the order number and UPC, followed by your contact info. Apple will then send you info on how to return your item; once the company receives your return, they'll email you a refund in the form of an Apple Gift Card. Like us!",

      "text": "  \nApple announced new (RED) products and other initiatives on Wednesday in honor of World AIDS Day, which takes place tomorrow, December 1. Customers can participate in supporting the fight against AIDS in a variety of ways, including buying specific albums, in-app content and more, with proceeds going to the Global Fund. \nApple’s four new products include a (PRODUCT) RED smart battery case for the iPhone 7, new Beats Solo 3 wireless on-ear headphones, a (RED) Pill+ portable speaker and a (RED) iPhone SE Case. Pricing is the same for these products as they are for the standard editions, though part of the proceeds heads toward the aforementioned Global Fund. Those are just the new products, of course; Apple has plenty of other ones that are available for a variety of products all year long. You don’t have to buy physical goods to help \nYou don’t need to buy any products direct from Apple if you want to participate. Apple teamed up with Bank of America and will donate $1 for every Apple Pay transaction used through a Bank of America account, with a cap at $1 million. Apple is also donating $1 for every purchase made in Apple Store locations or through its website or mobile app with Apple Pay, again up to $1 million. \nYou can also opt to purchase specific digital media, like The Killer’s Holiday album, Don’t Waste Your Wishes; 100 percent of those proceeds will go to the Global Fund. Or you can make in-app purchases from more than 20 games and apps, where special (RED) content will be sold. Here are the apps participating in that: \nAngry Birds 2, Angry Birds POP!, Best Fiends, Best Fiends Forever, Boom Beach, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, Clash of Clans, Clash Royale, CSR2, Episode, Farm Heroes Saga, FarmVille: Tropic Escape, FIFA Mobile, Hay Day, MARVEL Contest of Champions, PewDiePie’s Tuber Simulator, Plants vs. Zombies Heroes, SimCity BuildIt, War Dragons and YAHTZEE With Buddies. \n“The gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said on Wednesday. “Thanks to the vision and dedication of (RED), an AIDS-free generation is within our reach. We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that’s why our longtime partnership with (RED) remains so important to us.” \nHead to the source for more information on what Apple is doing to honor World AIDS Day.

      "title": "Apple's iPhone 7 'Trounced' By Pixel",
      "text": "Apple's iPhone 7 'Trounced' By Pixel Nov.30.16 \nMarket research firm Localytics has declared Google Pixel the “winner” of Black Friday. \nThe conclusion is based on Pixel achieving a higher percentage gain in sales. \nThe report is just one of many that investors will hear diminishing Apple in the coming weeks. According to market research firm Localytics, Google's (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) new Pixel smartphones \"won\" black Friday compared to Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL ) iPhone 7. Does this mean that Google sold more phones than Apple? No, not even close. Source: Apple Pixel Spin The desire to paint Pixel as a runaway hit while iPhone sales supposedly languish was very evident in Fortune's misleading take on the Localytics data: \" Google Pixel Trounced Apple's iPhone Over the Holiday Weekend \". The justification for this assertion was the Localytics blog piece that claimed that device activations were up 112% for Pixel, but only up 13% for iPhone 7 over the Black Friday weekend. Click to enlarge The numbers look impressive, until one asks the simple question: Activations were up compared to what? Localytics explained that this was compared to the previous four weekends' sales. That still sounds very impressive until one considers the total number of devices in question. According to Morgan Stanley , Google is expected to sell about 3 million Pixel phones in the December quarter, and 5-6 million in all of 2017. Apple will probably sell about 75 million iPhones (all models) in the December quarter, which I estimate about 2/3 being the newer iPhone 7 models, for 50 million. This means an approximate average weekly sales rate of 250,000 Pixel phones compared to over 4 million iPhone 7s per week, a ratio of more than 16/1. Assuming that Localytics numbers are correct, then the number of Pixel phones sold during Black Friday weekend surged to about 530,000 compared to iPhone 7's meager 4.7 million. This is a great example of how the business media manipulates market research data in order to make Apple look bad in the eyes of investors. Clearly, Apple has the law of large numbers working against it here, but that is never acknowledged. Localytics also published data purporting to show that iPhone 7 and 7 Plus not showing as much of a gain on Black Friday as last year's iPhone 6s and 6s Plus. Click to enlarge Now, does anybody in the known universe think that iPhone 7 will not outsell iPhone 6s in the December quarter? So what conclusion are we supposed to draw from the above chart? That iPhone 7 is a flop? Come on. The data is especially suspect since iPhone 7 Plus sales have been a much larger percentage of iPhone 7 total sales than in previous years. Kuo's Galaxy Quest KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo has issued yet another note to investors repeating his predictions that the next \"iPhone 8\" will feature a curved OLED screen, a glass back, and wireless charging. He claims that these features will drive \"unprecedented replacement demand\". Apple fans may not be aware of this, but what Kuo is describing, in terms of outward features, is the Samsung ( OTC:SSNLF ) Galaxy S7 Edge. The not so subtle message to investors is that Apple needs to build an iPhone copycat of the S7 Edge. This is what will drive sales, according to Kuo. It's another way of saying that no one should/would want an iPhone 7 since it's not like the S7 Edge. This is just another variant in the ongoing Kuo narrative that began early this year with his finding that iPhone 7 would lack \"compelling new features\" since it didn't have a curved OLED screen, a glass back, and wireless charging. Like the S7 Edge. Okay Ming-chi, we get it. You really think the S7 Edge is cool. You really think Apple should build a phone like it. Why keep repeating yourself? Because... if something is repeated enough times on the Internet, it will be accepted as true. Thus the Wall Street Journal runs yet another story based on \"supply chain\" sources claiming that Apple will adopt OLED for next year's iPhone. This is basically the same story that has been coming out of Korea since the beginning of the year. The more versions of it I see, the more I'm convinced that Samsung is behind it: \nBut LG Display, Japan Display and Sharp are behind Samsung when it comes to OLED investment. Samsung has spent close to $10 billion this year alone to expand its OLED production and research and development, while LG Display plans to invest close to $3 billion by 2018 to expand its production of smartphone OLED screens. The message, with only slight variation, is always the same: Apple will have to buy from Samsung, because Samsung is the OLED screen leader, and because OLED screens are obviously superior. Okay Samsung, we get it. You really think the S7 Edge is cool. You really think Apple should build a phone like it. Why keep repeating yourself? Because... if something is repeated enough times on the Internet, it will be accepted as true . Then I noticed something very odd about the WSJ article. It's the photo that it shows at the beginning, reproduced below. Click to enlarge The photo caption reads: \nA jet black iPhone 7 on the right compared with an iPhone 6 at an Apple Store in Chicago. Next year's version could feature a curved screen. Except that the supposed iPhone 6 being shown on the left has to be fake. It's too thick. The color of the case is wrong and the surface too shiny. And the power button is completely wrong. In case the reader doesn't recall what the iPhone 6 power button looked like, here's an image from iFixit's teardown of the iPhone 6. Click to enlarge Yet the WSJ photo clearly shows both phones with iOS home screens, indicating that the photo of the fake phones were generated with some care. That the WSJ didn't realize it was looking at a fake (or fakes) shows just how technically dumb media coverage of Apple can be. Investor Takeaway In the run-up to the January earnings seasons, investors can expect many such reports as we've received from Localytics and Kuo that in some way characterize Apple as stumbling. I'll try to provide analysis of many of these, but doubtless, I won't be able to keep up with all of them. At some point in the future, Apple may indeed adopt OLED screens. What I've pointed out in the past is that the presumption that OLED is inherently superior to LCD simply doesn't hold water technically . And I doubt that Apple will adopt any display technology alternative to LCD until Apple is satisfied that it is superior. As far as the glass sandwich, well, that was the big \"innovation\" for the S6 wasn't it? Samsung replaced the cheap feeling plastic backs of the previous generation S5 with curved glass. Apple has been there, done that with iPhone 4. I can't see Apple going back. I have in past articles complained that Apple is in need of a product architect . Apple's product design at times seems adrift and without a unifying vision. But I don't think things have gotten so bad that Apple will stoop to just aping Samsung. If that happens, I will immediately advocate regime change at Apple. But I don't expect this. I remain cautiously optimistic that December quarter sales will exceed expectations. I remain long Apple and recommend it as a buy for investors with a 3-5 year investment horizon. Disclosure: I am/we are long AAPL. I wrote this article myself, and it expresses my own opinions.

      "text": "Apple TV owners generally have a few things in common, without fail. They enjoy the Apple ecosystem, and they probably own one or more other Apple devices as well. Another thing they have in common, however, is that they have almost certainly lost the tiny little remote control that comes with the Apple TV at some point, and been forced to buy a new one from Apple. That wasn’t the worst thing in the world in the past, but now the new Siri Remote that comes with the Apple TV costs $79 to replace. $79! \nWell guess what: for $20, you can buy a simple accessory that should come in the box with every Apple TV that ships. Use it, and you’ll never lose your Apple TV remote again.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nThis is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year All of the new features the Android 7.0 Nougat update will bring to the Galaxy S7 Neflix’s new offline download feature has one massive drawback ",

All of the proceeds from the associated in-application purchases will go to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. \nFor instance, in Best Fiends Forever, players can purchase a (FOREVER)RED bundle, which includes a new souvenir, a two times damage bonus for all red Fiends and limited-edition stickers for use in iMessage. Users can also purchase a special Slap Damage boost. \nIn Marvel Contest of Champions, meanwhile, players can purchase the (POWER PACK)RED package, which contains a three-star Daredevil (classic) character, a three-star Elektra character, two Tier 5 Skill ISO-8 and a ticket that can be used to unlock a special in-game quest. When users complete the quest with 100 percent mastery, they’ll receive a three-star (CRYSTAL RED) for Elektra, Daredevil (classic), Iron Man, Red Hulk, Hulkbuster or Guillotine. \nHere’s the complete list of the participating games:",

      "title": "Tim Cook Says He Expects AirPods to Ship Over 'Next Few Weeks' in Email to Customer",
      "text": "Many customers are anxiously anticipating the release of Apple's wireless AirPods, originally slated to launch in October but later delayed. Fortunately, the wait may soon be over.\n\nMacRumors has been forwarded an email in which Apple CEO Tim Cook allegedly responded to a customer, saying he anticipates AirPods to begin shipping \"over the next few weeks.\"\n\n*Customer's comment:* \"Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I'm stuck waiting with my EarPods but can't charge my 7 at the same time which I need to do at work. Let us know if it's a month or 6 months, because then I'll just buy some other wireless headphones.\"\n\n*Tim Cook's response:* \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay---we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\"\n\nMacRumors has verified the email's full headers appear to originate from Apple's corporate servers, while Apple executives are known to respond to customers on occasion, but as a boilerplate disclaimer, it should be noted these emails can of course be faked. Apple did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n\nApple has so far only said it needed \"a little more time\" before AirPods are ready for customers, while conflicting rumors have pointed towards release dates between December and January, offering little clarity. AirPods remain listed as both \"coming soon\" and \"currently unavailable\" on different sections of Apple's website.Tags: Tim Cook, AirPods\n\nDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

These include apps that let users access their bank accounts and send money to each other. \nFIN executive director Brian Peters emphasized Trump’s business experience in a Wednesday letter outlining the coalition’s desire for “a national vision and coordinated strategy” to grow FinTech jobs and use FinTech to drive competition between financial services providers. \n“You campaigned on a promise to bring change to Washington, and your business experience, unique for any incoming President in history, offers a rare leadership opportunity that we believe sets the stage for modernizing some of our most antiquated financial rules,” wrote Peters. \nFIN broke down seven goals it laid out for the Trump administration, including appointing pro-technology regulators, streamlining federal money transmission and state lending rules and broadening access to FinTech. \nFIN asked Trump to appoint regulators, including a special Treasury undersecretary for technology, that “value technology and who will seek to promote innovation as a means to foster competition in financial services.” \nThe new Treasury undersecretary would be charged with spearheading a national FinTech strategy “to ensure America is the best country to create companies and grow jobs developing financial technologies.” \nTechnical goals include analyzing and exploring credit card security measures meant to limit fraud and stave off hackers, and making it possible for every American to access their financial accounts online by 2020. \nOthers focus on FinTech’s potential to expand financial services access. FIN asked the Trump administration to promote technology to help areas with few brick-and-mortar banks access online banking and payment services. \n“We are hopeful your team will embrace the essential role that technology plays in the democratization of finance,” wrote Peters. 1 day 1 Pelosi fends off challenge to...

      "title": "If youâ€™re buying a new Apple MacBook laptop, here’s what you should know about its processors",
      "text": "Apple’s newest MacBook Pro laptops have been met with mixed reviews . Some are concerned that the laptops are underpowered for the price Apple is charging, especially given that the company is using Intel processors that were released over a year ago.\nOne way that Apple attempts to make up for the slower, older chips it’s using in its newest MacBooks and MacBook Pros is to lean into a piece of marketing jargon invented by Intel. On every marketing and purchase page on Apple’s website, the company makes sure to mention something called Turbo Boost alongside a computer’s clock speed—the measurement of how fast a computer’s processor runs. Turbo Boost is a term invented by Intel to show that its processors can withstand being forced to run a little faster than they are listed as being able to do.\nIn the case of Apple’s newest, cheapest, MacBook Pro , that means the processor, which is listed as running at 2 GHz can withstand being run at up to 3.1 GHz for periods of time. You have no control over this—the computer will automatically over-clock the processor when it thinks it’s needed: “Whether the processor enters into Intel Turbo Boost Technology and the amount of time the processor spends in that state depends on the workload and operating environment,” Intel says on its marketing page about the technology.\nBut seeing as this technology is inherent to Intel’s chips, rather than something Apple has come up with, it’s obviously also available in every other companies’ computers that uses the same line of Intel chips. Popular laptops from Lenovo , HP , and Dell all have chips that have Turbo Boost, but none of these companies uses Intel’s term in its marketing. Dell says that its laptops have speeds “up to” their Turbo Boost speeds, as does HP, and Lenovo just doesn’t mention it.\nTo be fair, Apple is clearer than some PC makers about what the base processor speed is, by providing that separately from the boost speed. Dell, for example, says that its XPS 13 laptop has a seventh-generation Intel Core i5-7200U processor that runs “up to 3.1 GHz,” which on Intel’s site is listed as a 2.5 GHz processor that can Turbo Boost up to 3.1 GHz.\nIt’s not entirely clear when Apple began employing the “Turbo Boost” term—it started using Intel chips in its computers 11 years ago, and there are questions on Apple’s support page asking what the term means from 2012.\nThe speed of processors is most relevant for computing-intensive tasks, such as editing videos or playing videogames. It’s unlikely to be a major factor affecting the zippiness of your experience browsing the web or working on text documents. But for people shelling out thousands of dollars for Apple’s highest-end laptops, it’s worth knowing how the computing power compares to what’s available elsewhere, especially when some Windows competitors use newer Intel technology.\nApple has addressed why it’s using the older processors in its new MacBook Pros: Newer Intel chips were not available at the different sizes that Apple wanted for all of its new laptops. But, add the older processors to the concerns over the sheer number of adapters you’d need to buy to have the same types of ports available on last year’s laptops, the lack of the safe power cable Apple employed for a decade, and the questions over whether the new Touch Bar screen is worth the additional cost, and it’s easy to see why some longtime Mac users are considering switching to Windows machines.",

      "text": "Apple's next flagship iPhone 8 is said to feature a curved screen. (Photo : SeongJoon Cho/Bloomberg via Getty Images) Advertisement \nAlthough not confirmed yet, one can always think about what Apple does day and night with their new technology, Innovate. Apple is known to come out with the first Smart Phone in history. Recently, they are trying their luck without a headphone jack on the iPhone 7 and the innovative Macbook keyboards. \nHowever, recent news suggest that Apple is thinking about implementing a completely new feature to their iphones. Rumors say that they are thinking of adding curved screens to their phones: \nNow, it is not confirmed whether or not this is entirely true. But patently, Apple mentions that this could very well be in one of their top ten prototypes. Apple is known to mess around with many prototypes and so a curved screen could just be a prototype, or it could very easily be the next big thing. \nHowever, the iPhone 8 rumors do not just stop there. It is also being mentioned that if Apple does implement the new screen design, it could come out as soon as 2017. Now this is incredible, considering how the iPhone 7 series was just released. \nWall Street Journal is also taking their part of the cake as they mentioned other sorts of proof. They mentioned about how the Asian companies that supply Apple with phone parts were recently asked to increase their ouput on a new kind of Light emitting display. \nThis new form of LED Apple wants should be quite organic and thin. Why is that? Perhaps it could mean that a thinner display would be able to bend and curve more. Another rumor is that Apple's new phones will be released with the OLED display in mind, as per BGR. \nNow the OLED display has been seen in other non-apple products, but it is still considered a very new thing for products which come from Apple. However, when Apple was asked for comments regarding the OLED display or the Curved Screens, they declined to answer. \nAs of now, Apple fans one can only wait and hope to see some exciting changes in the upcoming flagship iPhone 8.

      "title": "ACCC Makes Preliminary Decision in Favor of Apple in Australia - Business Insider",
      "text": "Here's what a Trump presidency means for the payments industry \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple gained a key victory following a preliminary decision from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) against several of Australia's largest banks, which are fighting to collectively negotiate with Apple over access to its mobile wallet technology, according to Bloomberg. \nFor context, these banks, which include Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac, are looking to gain access to the iPhone hardware necessary to build their own mobile wallets rather than joining Apple Pay. The banks plan to bring additional information forward to reverse the decision before a final opinion is due in March. \nPartnering with Apple could actually be more beneficial for the banks than continuing to fight the technology giant. It's likely that a significant share of these banks' customers are Apple users. Apple users represent a significant portion of the Australian smartphone market — the phone provider had 40% of the Australian smartphone market share in Q2 2016, according to IDC. These consumers who may be interested in leveraging their smartphone's mobile wallet could become frustrated with these banks for not offering the payment option, and may look for other options such as a new bank or card issuer. For now, it seems like Australian consumers want Apple Pay. ANZ, the fourth major Australian bank, launched Apple Pay for its Visa, MasterCard, and Amex holders earlier this year. Following the partnership, demand for deposit accounts \"skyrocketed\" almost immediately. And since then, 20% of the bank’s customers have reportedly uploaded their payment information into the service, according to The Australian . ANZ shows that, though banks could gain from a proprietary product — bank-based Android wallets are very popular in Australia — working with Apple could help them quickly capitalize on pent-up mobile payment demand from iPhone users, who have largely been left out of the ecosystem in the country to now. \nThe preliminary ruling is a good sign for Apple, because allowing banks to build their own NFC-based wallets for iPhones could have major implications. Beyond the potential implications in Australia, the decision could set a precedent in other regions, like South Korea, that have companies looking for similar access to iPhone hardware. \nIn addition, the move could limit adoption, by pushing users away from Apple's proprietary product and towards an equivalent or better competitor. For Apple, that could ultimately impact revenue in some markets, because the firm could lose out on the per-transaction fee it charges card providers for payments through Apple Pay. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular thanks to services such as Apple Pay, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020.

Of the women graduating, over half received bachelor degrees in the biological sciences with fewer in the computer sciences (17.9%), engineering (19.3%), physical sciences (39%) and mathematics (43.1%), according to a report by the National Girls Collaborative Project .\nIt’s painfully clear that the US education system is falling behind when it comes to churning out more computer science job candidates. teachers can capture a student’s interest in computer science, the more likely the child will pursue a career or higher education in this area.\nTo help with this effort, Apple has partnered with Code.orgs programming tutorials to offer free Hour of Code workshops at all 487 Apple retail stores worldwide, from December 5 through 11 in celebration of Computer Science Education Week.\n“Since we started Hour of Code in 2013, Apple has each year upped its participation and found ways to introduce more kids to computer science,” said Hadi Partovi, founder and CEO of Code.org . “The global footprint Apple offers through its stores and talented staff has reached tens of thousands of kids, and with the introduction of Hour of Code in Swift Playgrounds we can introduce coding to even more.”\nAnother goal of the program is to entice more girls and minorities to become interested in coding. Women who are exposed to computer science in high school are ten times more likely to major in the subject and for Black and Hispanic students, they are seven times more likely to pursue this major, according to Code.org.\nSwift Playgrounds by Apple \nThe workshop is designed for participants who have basic iPad skills and are new to coding. The program includes an introduction to Swift Playgrounds™, the free new app for iPad that brings coding to life. The interactive interface of Swift Playgrounds encourages beginners to explore working with Swift™, the easy-to-learn programming language from Apple, used by professional developers to create world-class apps.\nIn addition to in-store workshops, Apple has developed a series of tools to extend Hour of Code into schools and community centers, including a free facilitator guide offering lesson ideas, group activities, and more. Apple Teacher , a free professional self-paced learning program supporting and celebrating teachers in the US, has added resources, badging and recognition for learning and teaching coding with Swift Playgrounds on iPad.\nWhile kids are the main focus of the program, Apple and Code.org also encourage parents who want to learn code to sign up and work along side of their child. Sign up at Apple.com and click on the Hour of Code.\nPhotos: Apple \n",

      "text": "Technology News | Wed Nov 30, 2016 | 3:37pm EST Cook ups Apple support for fight against AIDS Apple Inc CEO Tim Cook waves during an Apple media event in San Francisco, California, U.S. September 7, 2016. REUTERS/Beck Diefenbach By Julia Love \nApple Inc ( AAPL.O ) is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. \nOver the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America ( BAC.N ) will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. \nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. \nThe (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. \nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. \n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. \n(Reporting by Julia Love, editing by Peter Henderson) Next In Technology News ",

      "text": "smugmug apple tv app ( ) More Bill Roberson/Digital Trends\nPhoto hosting and sharing platform SmugMug has officially launched its first app for Apple TV. Now, in addition to viewing photos in your browser and on your smartphone, you will be able to browse and show off your favorite photographs on your television.\nMuch like SmugMug’s mobile apps, the Apple TV app enables you to browse through photos that you’ve uploaded to your account, and also flip through the work of other photographers you follow on SmugMug.\nIf you don’t feel like scrolling through your photos with the Apple TV remote, there’s a dedicated slideshow mode that will put together a simple slideshow of images from any given collection. No need to bother with settings or continually pressing “next” on the remote.\nMore: SmugMug saves almost 200 million photos from shuttered Picturelife\nAlso included in the SmugMug Apple TV app is a discovery mode that allows you to look through the work of a selection of photographers from around the world. SmugMug also notes that it will soon add to the app a Feature Photographer section, which will showcase the work of the best SmugMug photographers from around the globe. Even you can get in on the action if you are chosen.\nSmugMug also showcases its growing collection of award-winning films, which it has recently taken to producing. These films follow photographers from all over the world, documenting their activities to give you a behind-the-scenes look at how they prepare for and capture their images.\nTo promote the new app, SmugMug is also running a giveaway campaign in collaboration with SLR Lounge. Simply sign up here and your name will be entered to win one of three Apple TVs, as well as a SmugMug business account and a SmugMug prize pack.\nApple’s new TV app puts all your shows and movies in one place iPhone users can now shoot RAW DNG photos inside Lightroom Google Photos can now stabilize and share your shaky Apple Live Photos",

      "text": "print \nBII \nThis story was delivered to BI Intelligence \" Payments Briefing \" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here . \nApple gained a key victory following a preliminary decision from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) against several of Australia's largest banks, which are fighting to collectively negotiate with Apple over access to its mobile wallet technology, according to Bloomberg. \nFor context, these banks, which include Commonwealth Bank, National Australia Bank, and Westpac, are looking to gain access to the iPhone hardware necessary to build their own mobile wallets rather than joining Apple Pay. The banks plan to bring additional information forward to reverse the decision before a final opinion is due in March. \nPartnering with Apple could actually be more beneficial for the banks than continuing to fight the technology giant. It's likely that a significant share of these banks' customers are Apple users. Apple users represent a significant portion of the Australian smartphone market — the phone provider had 40% of the Australian smartphone market share in Q2 2016, according to IDC. These consumers who may be interested in leveraging their smartphone's mobile wallet could become frustrated with these banks for not offering the payment option, and may look for other options such as a new bank or card issuer. For now, it seems like Australian consumers want Apple Pay. ANZ, the fourth major Australian bank, launched Apple Pay for its Visa, MasterCard, and Amex holders earlier this year. Following the partnership, demand for deposit accounts \"skyrocketed\" almost immediately. And since then, 20% of the bank’s customers have reportedly uploaded their payment information into the service, according to The Australian . ANZ shows that, though banks could gain from a proprietary product — bank-based Android wallets are very popular in Australia — working with Apple could help them quickly capitalize on pent-up mobile payment demand from iPhone users, who have largely been left out of the ecosystem in the country to now. \nThe preliminary ruling is a good sign for Apple, because allowing banks to build their own NFC-based wallets for iPhones could have major implications. Beyond the potential implications in Australia, the decision could set a precedent in other regions, like South Korea, that have companies looking for similar access to iPhone hardware. \nIn addition, the move could limit adoption, by pushing users away from Apple's proprietary product and towards an equivalent or better competitor. For Apple, that could ultimately impact revenue in some markets, because the firm could lose out on the per-transaction fee it charges card providers for payments through Apple Pay. \nMobile payments are becoming more popular thanks to services such as Apple Pay, but they still face some high barriers, such as consumers' continued loyalty to traditional payment methods and fragmented acceptance among merchants. But as loyalty programs are integrated and more consumers rely on their mobile wallets for other features like in-app payments, adoption and usage will surge over the next few years. \nBI Intelligence , Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report on mobile payments that forecasts the growth of in-store mobile payments in the U.S., analyzes the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay, Android Pay, and Samsung Pay, and addresses the barriers holding mobile payments back as well as the benefits that will propel adoption. \nHere are some key takeaways from the report: In our latest US in-store mobile payments forecast, we find that volume will reach $75 billion this year. We expect volume to pick up significantly by 2020, reaching $503 billion. This reflects a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 80% between 2015 and 2020. Consumer interest is the primary barrier to mobile payments adoption. Surveys indicate that the issue is less the mobile wallet itself and more that people remain loyal to traditional payment methods and show little enthusiasm for picking up new habits. Integrated loyalty programs and other add-on features will be key to mobile wallets taking off. Consumers are showing interest in wallets with integrated loyalty programs. Other potential add-ons, like in-app, in-browser, and P2P payments, will also start fueling adoption. This strategy has been proved successful in China with platforms like WeChat and Alipay. \nIn full, the report: Forecasts the growth of US in-store mobile payments volume and users through 2020. Measures mobile wallet user engagement by forecasting mobile payments' share of their annual retail spending. Reviews the performance of major mobile wallets like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.

      "title": "Apple AirPods to release in “coming weeks,” says alleged Tim Cook email",
      "text": "See full gallery on TechnoBuffalo An alleged email from Apple CEO Tim Cook suggests that Apple’s AirPods, which have been delayed for unknown reasons, may end up being available before the holidays after all. The email was forwarded to MacRumors from a reader who says he or she reached out to Tim Cook directly.\nHere’s how the convo went down, according to MacRumors: \nCustomer’s comment: “Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I’m stuck waiting with my EarPods but can’t charge my 7 at the same time which I need to do at work. Let us know if it’s a month or 6 months, because then I’ll just buy some other wireless headphones.”\nTim Cook’s response: “Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay—we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.”\nI’m not sure I buy it I hope the AirPods are available soon. While I’m not yet convinced I want them for myself — they look a bit goofy, after all — I find the product and the pairing process rather compelling. I’m also not 100 percent sold on this email being legitimate. Sure, Tim Cook replies to emails from time-to-time, but this is a pretty big deal. Apple should make it well known that the AirPods are coming if, indeed, they’re really on the horizon.\nI bet Apple sells out of these things faster than the NES Classic on a Target shelf if they’re available before the holidays. There’s been so much hype about AirPods since they launched and, given the lack of the headphone jack on the iPhone 7, I’m guessing consumers are ready to go bonkers over the new buds. They’re delayed for a reason, though. That has me worried. Is it a quality control problem? An issue with battery life? Those weren’t really complaints in early pre-production reviews. Perhaps supply is too slim.\nWe’ll let you know if we get any official word from Apple on availability, for now just consider that there seems to be some possibility, however small, that AirPods will ship in a few weeks.\n\n\nSource : MacRumors ",

      "title": "Apple's iOS 10.1.1 update is causing huge battery life problems for some users",
      "text": "No OS update is ever perfect, but Apple’s iOS 10 initially launched to strong reviews and fewer reports of problems than we’ve seen with some of Apple’s other launches. The recent 10.1.1 update, however, appears to be causing problems. A number of users are reporting drastically reduced battery life and much higher device temperatures.\nPart of the problem appears to be related to battery charge monitoring — News.com.au Quote: s one user as saying: “It jumps from 30 per cent charge to 1 per cent in a few seconds then shuts down. As soon as it reboots after connecting to a charger it show 30 per cent charge. When I unplug it right away it still shows 30 per cent and runs like nothing happened for a good few hours.”\nI’ve seen this happen on my own iPhone, particularly as the device has gotten older. It’s not uncommon for my phone to display irregular behavior — dropping extremely quickly at some points, and then reporting a steady charge level at a given value (60% and 29% appear to be particularly favorite sticking points for my own device). My significant other’s device has a similar problem. That said, this isn’t a new issue for either of us, and it doesn’t appear to affect the overall battery life — just the displayed battery level.\n“Massive reduction in battery life” wasn’t on the feature list.\nSome iOS users who also develop for the platform have tried to isolate the problem, with no success. One Hacker News commenter writes :\n[M]y iPhone 6 has gone from being needing to be charged every 1.5 days to at least 3 times a day minimum. It also runs extremely hot a lot of the time, regardless of how many or what apps are running in the background… the phone’s “Battery Usage” list is useless, as it shows things like Mail being used for 3 minutes, and using 25% of the battery power since last charge. Varying apps are listed as huge battery sucks even when I don’t think they are (Calculator anybody?!?) At this very moment, it is saying that Apple Remote took 26% of the battery charge, Messages took 11% and the Home & Lock Screen took 9% since last charge – about 30 minutes ago!\nThings that I expect to suck up the battery, like the Moves app, says only 2%.\nI’ve even plugged my phone into my PC and gone into XCode to check the logs to see if anything is standing out, but nothing in the logs point to a particular app or process chewing battery time.\nImmensely frustrating. Another dev friend of mine has said that the iOS 10.2 beta has fixed most of his problems, so I may download that from our developer account and see if it works… I have done a full factory reset on the phone and restored from iTunes backup twice now, with no improvement at all.\nThe problems don’t seem limited to any specific iPhone model or feature, and there’s no known cause or solution as of this writing. Apple pushed two versions of iOS 10.1.1 — the first release dropped on October 31 and a second version of the update was released on November 9. Apple hasn’t disclosed any reason for the second push, however, and it only went out to owners who hadn’t previously downloaded 10.1.1. If you’re using 10.1.1 (either flavor) have you noticed any problems?",

      "text": "One of Apple’s big charitable efforts is a partnership with the Bono-founded HIV/AIDS charity, RED . A number of Apple’s products are tied to the organization, with an undisclosed portion of the profits generated going to the charity. Now a number of additional products have joined in.\nThis news arrives as Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke with USA Today about some of the company’s philanthropic efforts. He spoke about what ethos Apple has and the values it wants to uphold.\n“Of course corporations should have values because people should have values,” says the tech leader, who has been vocal on a range of civic issues, from gay rights to privacy rules. “And corporations are just a bunch of people.”\nHe went on to discuss how he wants Apple to leave the world a better place than when it entered it and that involves helping communities and charitable causes.\nMore: Apple CEO Tim Cook suggests company may prefer augmented reality over VR\nHe spoke of Apple’s commitment to this year’s World AIDS Day on Friday, where 400 Apple stores around the world will play host to banners supporting the RED organization and its message. The money though will come from sponsored sales: iPhone 7 battery packs, Beats Solo 3 headphones, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans — all will donate a proceed of their profits to RED. Apple will also be donating up to a $1 million, in $1 portions, for every Apple Pay purchase on Friday.\nMuch of this drive is said to come as a form of counter to the rhetoric of President-elect Donald Trump, who infamously made wild comments about all sorts of causes and issues during the election. With concerns that when in power he could reduce funding to HIV and AIDS charities, Cook and others may be stepping in to fill a potential void.\nCook does have a history of standing firm against political stances he disagrees with too. Earlier in 2016, Apple fought in the courtroom to prevent the FBI from forcing it to break security on one of its iPhones. However, Cook has drawn criticism for doing business in countries where homosexuality is criminalized.\nCook, however, shrugs off any suggestion that such charitable moves are publicity stunts.\n“This (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn’t,” he said. “Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.”\nT-Mobile Tuesday is #GivingTuesday next week, for local Boys & Girls Clubs Users can now donate to their favorite nonprofits through Apple Pay Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant",

      "title": "iPhone 8 Will Feature Wireless Charging",
      "text": "• OLED screens \n• Glass body \nThe same source also claims that Apple is set to observe record breaking sales with the iPhone 8 to be launched next year. The report estimates the sales to surpass the success of the iPhone 6 duo. The company is expected shift around 150 million units by the end of the year. If this actually does happen iPhone 8 will be the best selling iPhone till date. \nThe much expected success relies on the iPhone 8 duo hopefully penetrating the smartphone market. The first new model is expected to reinvent Apple’s proposition with its curved OLED screen. This technology will be available for the very first time in the smartphone industry. \nThis device is made to attract the high-end customers and will encourage iPhone 6 users for a hardware upgrade. The other two models will be an iterative upgrade to the current Apple iPhone 7 models. However the new models will exhibit OLED display and will have a potential visual overhaul. \nThe most interesting thing which accompanies all the models is that all three models will feature wireless charging and will have redesigned glass chassis. The new technology will actually come in a beautiful envelope. \nThis time Apple has decided to integrate its high-end technology in all of its models instead of incorporating it in the high end model as with the iPhone 7, it only included its iSight Duo camera in the iPhone 7 Plus only. This actually means those who grab the new 4.7 inch iPhone 8 models will also get to experience the novel technology. You May Like",

      "text": "Reddit \nSome Apple users have been plagued with iCloud calendar invite spam in recent weeks, with calendar periods being blocked up with unsolicited events from anonymous senders (usually with Chinese names). It is thought that the spammers are mass targeting any iCloud email account it can find on the web, rather than targeting specific users. \nApple has now acknowledged the issue in a statement to iMore with an apology for the issue to affected users. The company says it is actively “identifying and blocking suspicious senders” to counter the spam activity. \niCloud calendar spam has been a long-running issue but peaked in recent weeks with a fresh wave of spammers exploiting the holiday shopping season. As any person can send an invite to an arbitrary email address, these unscrupulous senders are simply trying any email address they can find, hoping a real person is on the other end of it. \nHere’s Apple’s full statement, as provided to iMore . \nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent. \nRecipients of the spam invites are left in a confusing situation as there isn’t a clear-cut solution for the problem. Users can Decline the invites, which will remove the event from their calendar, but lets the sender know that the email address is active and will not prevent the spammers from sending more invites in future. \nCalendar on iOS and Mac currently lacks any way to block these invites. In the absence of an official feature, there is a convoluted workaround to use in the meantime … but isn’t simple or convenient. Perhaps in a future software release, Apple will add a feature to limit the scope of people that can invite an account. \nAs mentioned in the statement, the company is currently attacking the issue from the server-side. It is employing spam-detection techniques to prevent the invites from going out in the first place. Time will tell if this strategy is effective and/or sufficient.",

      "text": "Reddit \nAhead of the Apple Music exclusive stream of the documentary ‘808’ set for Dec. 9, Apple has tweeted a new trailer for the film that focuses on Roland’s iconic TR-808 drum machine. ‘808’ was originally shown at the 2015 SXSW Film Festival and is just shy of 7/10 stars on IMDb as of this writing. Atlantic Records is offering the soundtrack album now and looks to be selling apparel in the near future. The tracklist includes a wide variety of genres and artists ranging from Hip Hop Be Bop (Don’t Stop) by Man Parrish, Paul Revere by the Beastie Boys, to Lil Jon & The East Side Boyz. \nThis documentary effort by Apple is of course in line with their work to blend the liberal arts and technology, and also seems to be on message with respecting and celebrating the past, such as their new hardbound book covering 20 years of Apple’s design history. For those interested in music history there is a video from the YouTube channel RetroSound dedicated to the famous drum beats made possible with the Roland TR-808. They even include captions detailing what songs the beats come from. Decades of music defined by one little machine.Check out the new trailer for @808TheMovie .Available 12/9 on #AppleMusic . \n— Apple Music (@AppleMusic) November 30, 2016 \nAs we previously covered, you can watch the documentary with an Apple Music subscription next Friday and it will also be available to rent or buy from iTunes on December 19. The soundtrack is available now on Apple Music and iTunes. Guides",

      "text": "Australian regulator set to oppose collective bank bargaining on Apple Pay Tue Nov 29, 2016 12:58am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \nBy Jamie Freed and Byron Kaye \nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia's antitrust regulator said on Tuesday it is likely to deny four local banks permission to collectively bargain with Apple Inc (AAPL.O: Quote ) in relation to its mobile digital payments system. \nBut the preliminary decision was \"finely balanced\" and could be reversed if the banks make a convincing case before a final opinion is due in March, Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Chairman Rod Sims told Reuters. \nLosing the case would be a setback to the banks' hopes of bypassing Apple's in-house payments system and rolling out their own iPhone versions free of competition from the Silicon Valley giant, which has the biggest smartphone market share in Australia. \nUnder Australian law, bargaining cartels can be formed as long as they have permission from authorities, and the banks are seeking the ability to offer their own digital wallets in Apple iPhones - the first major challenge to Apple Pay of its kind. \nCommonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA.AX: Quote ), Westpac Banking Corp (WBC.AX: Quote ), National Australia Bank Ltd (NAB.AX: Quote ) and smaller rival Bendigo and Adelaide Bank Ltd (BEN.AX: Quote ) also want to bargain with Apple over charging customers extra fees for transactions made through Apple Pay. \nA successful application would allow the banks - which jointly have two-thirds of the Australian credit card market - to collectively boycott Apple Pay for up to three years as a negotiating tactic. \nApple has argued that third parties should not have access to its digital wallet technology because it would undermine customers' privacy and data security. The company's representatives did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. \nApple Pay allows users to register credit cards on devices such as iPhones, and pay for goods and services by swiping the devices over contactless payment terminals. Apple charges card providers for transactions via the service, which it introduced to Australia last year. Continued... ",

By default, iCloud processes these and tries to add them to your calendar… which helped the spammer sneak around spam filters and generally caused a notification to pop up on your various screens. It’s not a particularly malicious trick, but damn is it annoying. \nAfter a few days of silence on the matter, Apple has acknowledged the issue, apologized for the spam, and says it’s working on fixing it. Here’s the statement from Apple: \nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.

      "text": "Apple Acknowledges iCloud Calendar Spam, Promises To Fix It  19 PST Image credit – OS X Daily \nIf you are an iCloud user and use Apple’s iOS or Mac products and you have been receiving some spam invites on your calendar, you’re not alone. In fact it seems to be popping up more frequently as of late, and users are getting pretty fed up with it. However   Apple has finally acknowledged it and will be fixing it. \nAccording to a tweet by iMore’s Rene Ritchie , he posted a statement from Apple which reads, “We are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address this issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam in the invites being sent.” \nIt is unclear how these spammers even got past in the first place considering that this has never been an issue in the past, but hopefully whatever the reason is, Apple can fix it ASAP. In the meantime there have been several guides posted onto the internet on how to deal with the spam. \nOne of which involves redirecting those spam invites to your email where hopefully your email provider can detect the spam and block it on your behalf, or the alternative is to create a separate calendar where you can send the spam to and delete it without actually having to respond to the spam invite. \nFiled in Apple .

Today, to mark World AIDS Day, Apple and a bunch of app developers have announced new products and special edition apps to step up the fight. \nTwenty popular games, including Angry Birds 2, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, FIFA Mobile, Plants v Zombies Heroes and Clash of Clans, are offering limited edition Red content with proceeds from the in-app purchases going to the Global Fund to fight AIDS. \nApple is also adding four new Red products from today, including an iPhone 7 Smart Battery Case and the new Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones. \nApple makes a donation to the Global Fund with every Red product purchased in a program that has raised about $160 million in the past decade. \nApple CEO Tim Cook said “the gift of life is the most important gift that anyone can give”. \n“Thanks to the vision and dedication of Red, an AIDS-free generation is within our reach,” he said. \n“We want to leave the world better than we found it, and that’s why our longtime partnership with Red remains so important to us.” \nApple says more than 70 million people have benefited by the Red-supported Global Fund grants in the past 10 years.",

Its sales during the month are estimated to have grown by 20-30% while handset sales, as a whole, are down compared with the year-ago period,” the ET report said. \nApple iPhone is the most expensive mobile handset market in India –with price ranging between Rs 55,000 and Rs 90,000. \nIn the biggest-ever move to curb black money and crime funding, Prime Minister Narendra Modi on November 8 announced that Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 banknotes would become illegal tenders and massively curbed cash withdrawals through ATMs and from bank counters. \nFirst Published: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 - 11:40 More from zeenews ",

      "text": "Apple Releases Boot Camp Audio Driver Update To Address Speaker Issues By Tyler Lee on 11/30/2016 15:22 PST \nIt seems that there has been some issues regarding Boot Camp on the new MacBook Pro laptops in which according to users, every now and then a loud pop could occur when booting into Windows that in some cases, has led to the damaging of the speakers inside of the laptop, which is clearly not a good sign. \nThe good news is that according to AppleInsider , they have confirmed that Apple has since released an update to the Boot Camp drivers in which it should address the issue. Users who have installed Boot Camp since 1PM on the 23rd of November should already have the latest drivers, for users who have older installations, you’ll have to run the update process manually within Windows after you’ve booted into it. \nUnfortunately while this does deal with the popping noise problem, this clearly can’t fix speakers that have already been damaged. However Apple is aware of it and has told AppleInsider that users who still continue to have this problem persist in macOS to get in touch with Apple Care phone support, and also to make an appointment at the Genius Bar where Apple will take a look at the problem and rectify it where possible. \nFiled in Apple > Computers .

      "text": "Apple is in the midst of removing outdated games and apps from the App Store November 30, 2016 | By Alissa McAloon November 30, 2016 | By Alissa McAloon More: Smartphone/Tablet \nApple is currently in the process of removing outdated, abandoned, and non-functional apps from the iOS App Store. The process got started in early September and is still going strong nearly three months later. \nThe App Store has had a longstanding problem with abandoned, nonfunctional, or misleading applications crowding the pages of the digital storefront, and this mass removal has no-doubt helped to alleviate that issue but the process hasn’t been painless. \nSome game developers have noticed that their older but functional iOS games are being flagged for removal under the deletion criteria put forth by Apple. \nThe App Store’s games category has been hit the hardest by this policy. According to data gathered by TechCrunch, 28 percent of the overall 47,300 apps removed in October were iOS games. The next category down the list, entertainment, only made up 8.99 percent of the deletions. \nThe company originally announced plans to declutter the App Store at the beginning of September. An email shared by TechCrunch explained that Apple is flagging apps that no longer work, don’t follow current review guidelines, or haven’t been updated in “a long time” for deletion. \nAfter being contacted by Apple, developers have 30 days to fix the reported issue with their app or it’ll be removed from the digital storefront. Apple’s FAQ has more information on the process itself. Related Jobs Wargaming   [11.30.16] Fox Cub Games — Remote,   [11.30.16]",

      "text": "Apple's Smart Battery Case for iPhone is gross. It's ugly, and there's really no getting around that. Before today, buying one should have come with a sense of shame and regret, but now that there's a Product (RED) version, at least you can pick one up and know that you're doing some good for the world, even if it's at the expense of good taste.\nContinue reading... \nTrending right now: \nApple will pay you zero money to trade in your Apple Watch No, Google’s Pixel didn’t ‘trounce’ the iPhone on Black Friday This tool tells you if your Gmail account was infected with malware ",

      "title": "iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update: 9 Things to Know After One Month",
      "text": "Its been a little more than a month since Apple replaced iOS 10.1 with iOS 10.1.1. With that in mind, we want to take a look at the most important things you need to know about the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update as we push toward into December.\nAdvertisement\nIn September, Apple confirmed an iOS 10 release date for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 9 powered devices and on September 13th the company pushed the iOS 10 update to iPhone 6 models around the globe.\niOS 10 delivered new features and enhancements but it also brought problems to the iPhone 6, iPhone 7, and other popular mobile devices.\nIn an effort to clean up iOS 10, the company’s released several bug fix updates for the iPhone 6 and its other iOS 10-powered devices. The latest is iOS 10.1.1, a small update that brings a key fix to the former flagship smartphone.\nThe iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update is a tiny update if you’re coming directly from iOS 10.1. If you’re coming to iOS 10.1.1 from iOS 9 or iOS 8, it’ll be much larger due to iOS 10.1 and iOS 10. The features from Apple’s previous iOS 10 updates are baked into iOS 10.1.1.\nAdvertisement\nWith the smoke from the iOS 10.1.1 release settled we want to take a look at the most important things iPhone 6 owners need to know about the iOS 10.1.1 update at the three week mark.\nThis roundup offers a quick iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 review, details about the iOS 10 downgrade, a look at some of the problems plaguing the iPhone 6 after iOS 10.1.1, and a whole lot more.\nCheck back for regular updates as we make our way into December.\niPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 Update Review: One Month Later 1 / 9\nAdvertisement\nWe've been using the iPhone 6 iOS 10.1.1 update for a full month and we've been keeping a close eye on key areas like battery life, connectivity, and UI speed. Here's what we've found during our time with the current version of iOS 10.\nWe haven't noticed any major problems with iPhone 6 battery life with the iOS 10.1.1 update on board. The device continues to hold an excellent charge at the month mark.\nIf you recently installed iOS 10.1.1 on your iPhone 6 and you're seeing battery drain issues give it a couple of days to settle in. If it fails to settle after a couple of days with iOS 10.1.1 installed, you'll want to try some manual fixes for battery life problems.\nWe've tested the phone and its update with several ISPs, routers, and Bluetooth devices and we're still having an excellent experience. We haven't noticed any major problems or dropped connections. AT&T LTE/4G continues to perform at a high level as well.\nThe iPhone 6 is still extremely fast with iOS 10.1.1 on board. Animations and transitions are incredibly fluid and we haven't experienced any lag in problem areas like Control Center and the Notifications tray.\nThe iOS 10.1.1 update is treating our iPhone 6 well at the one month milestone. We recommend it for most iOS 10 users.\nThat said, you'll want to seek out a second or third opinion before you make your move. This is especially important if you're coming from iOS 9.3.5 or below. You can't go back to iOS 9 once you make the move to iOS 10.\n1 / 9",

      "text": "share Apple's renewed fight against AIDS includes new iPhone cases You can also use Apple Pay, buy music and make in-app purchases to donate to a good cause. Share Save \nApple has made a tradition of marking World AIDS Day with a campaign to donate to the Product (RED) charity, and it's going the extra mile for its 10th year of support. On top of the company's existing (RED) gear (which sends a contribution to the Global Fund's fight against AIDS), it's launching four new accessories and devices that count toward the charity. You can get red versions of the iPhone 7 Battery Case , the leather iPhone SE case, Beats Solo 3 Wireless headphones and the Beats Pill+ wireless speaker. All of these are available today, and there are other ways to help out even if you have no intentions of buying hardware. \nTo begin with, purchasing anything at an Apple store (physical or online) through Apple Pay between now and December 6th will donate $1 toward (RED), up to a maximum of $1 million. Bank of America will match those donations if you buy using one of its cards. You can also buy an album from The Killers ( Don't Waste Your Wishes ) on iTunes with all US proceeds heading to the fund. Beyond this, in-app purchases in 20 high-profile iOS games (including Angry Birds 2 , Clash of Clans and PewDiePie's Tuber Simulator ) will contribute to the anti-AIDS campaign through December 7th. \nThese individual efforts may seem like drops in the bucket, but Apple has historically been one of Product (RED)'s strongest contributors -- it had raised $65 million by 2013 . And while a bona fide cure is still years away, the United Nations now believes that you could realistically see the end of AIDS by 2030. You may only make a small difference by yourself, but the combined effort adds up.",

Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones took a different turn this year and their popularity and performance has so far exceeded expectations. However, there has been a bug reported on Google’s product forum which involves screenshots sent from an iPhone 7 Plus to the Pixel. The screenshots do not appear normally; instead they are distorted and appear as though the display of the phone is damaged in some way. Pixel users have complained on the community forum sharing images of the distorted screenshots.

The worst part is there’s no easy way to make them stop though it is possible if you don’t mind jumping through a few hoops. \nSimply declining events might do more harm than good, too, because it indicates to spammers that your account is active. So, what are you supposed to do? Apple says it’s working on a fix. \nHere’s a statement the company provided to iMore’s Rene Ritchie over an iMessage conversation: \nWe are sorry that some of our users are receiving spam calendar invitations. We are actively working to address the issue by identifying and blocking suspicious senders and spam invites being sent. \nAs of now, Apple doesn’t allow iOS and Mac users to block these annoying invites, which means they’ll just keep coming and coming until Apple puts a stop to it. When technology backfires \nMaking matters worse is a feature found in macOS and iOS that automatically scans your inbox for invitations. It seems the very feature designed to make your life easier is backfiring. \nWho knows how long it will take for Apple to come up with a fix. Hopefully, it happens soon. \nFor now, be weary of any mysterious calendar invites that come your way.",

      "text": "apple red charity tim cook More One of Apple’s big charitable efforts is a partnership with the Bono-founded HIV/AIDS charity, RED . A number of Apple’s products are tied to the organization, with an undisclosed portion of the profits generated going to the charity. Now a number of additional products have joined in.\nThis news arrives as Apple CEO Tim Cook spoke with USA Today about some of the company’s philanthropic efforts. He spoke about what ethos Apple has and the values it wants to uphold.\n“Of course corporations should have values because people should have values,” says the tech leader, who has been vocal on a range of civic issues, from gay rights to privacy rules. “And corporations are just a bunch of people.”\nHe went on to discuss how he wants Apple to leave the world a better place than when it entered it and that involves helping communities and charitable causes.\nMore: Apple CEO Tim Cook suggests company may prefer augmented reality over VR\nHe spoke of Apple’s commitment to this year’s World AIDS Day on Friday, where 400 Apple stores around the world will play host to banners supporting the RED organization and its message. The money though will come from sponsored sales: iPhone 7 battery packs, Beats Solo 3 headphones, Angry Birds, Clash of Clans — all will donate a proceed of their profits to RED. Apple will also be donating up to a $1 million, in $1 portions, for every Apple Pay purchase on Friday.\nMuch of this drive is said to come as a form of counter to the rhetoric of President-elect Donald Trump, who infamously made wild comments about all sorts of causes and issues during the election. With concerns that when in power he could reduce funding to HIV and AIDS charities, Cook and others may be stepping in to fill a potential void.\nCook does have a history of standing firm against political stances he disagrees with too. Earlier in 2016, Apple fought in the courtroom to prevent the FBI from forcing it to break security on one of its iPhones. However, Cook has drawn criticism for doing business in countries where homosexuality is criminalized.\nCook, however, shrugs off any suggestion that such charitable moves are publicity stunts.\n“This (RED) partnership allows us to touch a group of people we normally wouldn’t,” he said. “Sub-Saharan Africa is not a big marketplace for us. This is about trying to lift people up.”\nT-Mobile Tuesday is #GivingTuesday next week, for local Boys & Girls Clubs Users can now donate to their favorite nonprofits through Apple Pay Ireland to appeal $14.5 billion tax penalty imposed on Apple, EU remains adamant",

      "text": "apple airpods launch delayed More Alongside the reveal of the iPhone 7 earlier in 2016, Apple also unveiled a new pair of wireless in-ears , dubbed the AirPods. These were originally set to ship in October, but just before the end of the month, the company delayed the launch, saying it needed a little more time. What the company didn’t address was when the true wireless in-ears would ship.\nMore: Everything you need to know about Apple’s AirPods\nNow we might finally have an idea. Apple CEO Tim Cook appears to have responded to an email from an exasperated customer with a clue at when the AirPods could ship. “Thanks for your note,” the email reads. “Sorry for the delay — we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.”\nWhether or not the email actually came from Cook is a matter of debate, but MacRumors reports the email headers pointed to the email coming from Apple’s servers. This type of data can be faked, but Apple executives have taken it upon themselves to respond to customer complaints in the past. For its part, Apple has not confirmed or denied whether Cook did send the email.\nAs is generally the case with the company, Apple didn’t say what the issue behind the delay was, or whether it was a hardware or software problem. Multiple outlets have had time with pre-release versions of the AirPods, and while some of the minor issues often found in early versions were present, none are reporting any major issues.\nMore: Apple reportedly invests in Omnifone staff and technology to beef up Apple Music\nOne thing that likely isn’t the cause of the delay is the new W1 chip that was announced alongside the AirPods and is what powers the long-lasting battery life touted by Apple. The Beats Solo3 and Powerbeats3 — both of which use the W1 chip — managed to ship on time.\nSome retailers have said that they already have demonstration models of the AirPods in hand and are just waiting for stock to arrive, so if you’re holding out for a release before the holiday shopping season is over, there may still be hope.\nStory originally published in October 2016. Updated on 11/30/2016 by Kris Wouk: Added news of the AirPods possibly shipping before the end of 2016\nEverything you need to know about Apple’s AirPods Apple announces three new pairs of Beats headphones, all using its W1 chip Apple’s new fully wireless AirPods are highly efficient and loaded with tech",

      "text": "Apple tax ruling to top agenda when Taoiseach meets Tim Cook   By Elaine LoughlinPolitical Reporter \nThe Apple tax ruling will be top of the agenda when Taoiseach Enda Kenny meets with the head of the tech company in Silicon Valley. \nThe Taoiseach is to meet with Apple CEO Tim Cook at Infinite Loop in Cupertino today after travelling to the United States on a four-day trip. \nHe is also due to travel to New York and although a meeting with President-Elect Donald Trump is yet to be confirmed, it is understood that contact has been made with his team to arrange a meeting if schedules permit. \nThe Taoiseach and Mr Cook will discuss Apple’s current and planned investment and operations in Ireland, including the planned Athenry data centre. READ NEXT ‘Emily was her No 1 priority... I don’t think she saw her life without Emily’ \nHowever, it is expected that much of the meeting will focus on the EU Commission’s landmark ruling. \nFollowing a three-year investigation, the EU ruled that the technology giant Apple owes Ireland €13bn in unpaid taxes over the past decade. \nA spokesman for the Taoiseach said they would “take stock” of developments relating to the European Commission’s decision regarding Apple’s tax liability, including the State and the company’s appeals. \nThe Dáil voted to appeal the multi-billion euro ruling in September. \nApple have not yet lodged an appeal to the EU Commission ruling but it has until the end of the year to do so. \nThe Taoiseach will then travel to Facebook headquarters later this morning where in advance of his engagement with the Bay Area economic council, he will have the opportunity to meet with management and staff at the social media company. \nMr Kenny will spend tomorrow in New York where he will meet with and address business groups including the Partnership for New York City and a meeting of key business leaders hosted by Peter Grauer, chairman of Bloomberg. \nHe will meet a number of existing and potential investors in Ireland and attend the signing of a partnership between Enterprise Ireland and Northwell Healthcare Group, a leading US healthcare company. \nAhead of the trip Mr Kenny said: “My visit to the United States is a timely opportunity to engage with key business leaders to promote Ireland and highlight our strengths as a gateway for US firms into Europe and other global markets. \n“In all engagements I will highlight our highly skilled workforce, our competitive tax offering and our focus on innovation as well as our strong commitment to EU membership.”",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "title": "Airpods release date: Apple reportedly shipping first pairs in the \"next few weeks\"",
      "text": "Apple CEO Tim Cook introduced the world to Airpods at Apple's iPhone event back in September . The wireless earbuds garnered a ton of hype ( and mockery ) but faded from the limelight after a series of delays hit their release date. Now they're reportedly just a few weeks from shipping.\nMacRumors obtained an email thread in which Cook himself reassured an anxious customer of the Airpods' impending arrival:\nCustomer's comment: \"Give us a release date. I really bought in to the wireless vision you painted. Now I'm stuck waiting with my EarPods but can't charge my 7 at the same time, which I need to do at work. Let us know if it's a month or 6 months, because then I'll just buy some other wireless headphones.\"\nTim Cook's response: \"Thanks for your note. Sorry for the delay — we are finalizing them and I anticipate we will begin to ship over the next few weeks.\" A \"few weeks\" is still vague, but it's at least a hint for eager Apple customers. The company was originally supposed to ship the Airpods by October; now we should hopefully see them by Christmas .\nApple Airpods Source: Stephen Lam/Getty Images Airpods utilize a Bluetooth connection to wirelessly transmit sound. An embedded W1 chip intuitively recognizes when a user is speaking or listening to filter noise and engages the Airpods' built-in microphone accordingly. Perhaps most groundbreaking is the integration of Siri, which allows users to give voice commands to make phone calls, adjust volume, look up directions and more.",

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "text": "Apple Inc is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World Aids Day. Over the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America (BAC.N) will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards.\n“There’s still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,” Cook said in the interview. UNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. The (RED) campaign is an example of “cause-related marketing,” a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause.\nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. “When we put ourselves into something, it’s worth a lot more than just money,” he said. (RED) was one of Apple’s highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006.\nReuters \nThe post Tim Cook and Apple expand support for AIDS with artist Bono’s Charity, RED appeared first on Tech2 .",

But you won’t be getting any gift cards back your way.\nApple’s recycling program was updated to allow customers to recycle their Watches today, but unlike an iPad, iPhone, Mac, PC or smartphone trade-in, your Apple Watch will be sent the way of the iPod and the other older Apple devices.\nThe company contracts with three recycling companies to handle the iPhones and iPads, the computers and the other devices: in order, they are SoftBank-owned Brightstar , PowerON Services and Sims Recycling Solutions. The other devices are not eligible for Apple Store Gift Cards like the other devices are. Hell, even the iPod gets some customers somewhere — if it’s not an iPod shuffle, they can trade it in and get 10 percent off a new one.\nSo, if your Apple Watch is short of smashed up, perhaps you might just go for the Swappa or eBay route after all. Or maybe you’ll just wait it out until Apple gives you a little more incentive to avoid the landfill . After all, the company can definitely change things up in the future and we don’t know what the rationale behind the poor offer.\nThe post Apple Watch recycling program offers nothing in exchange appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Revolutionary Post-Production Plug-in for Adobe, Apple, Avid, and VEGAS video editors   5:02 pm GMT (Los Gatos, California--November 30, 2016) PowerProduction Software , a leading developer of visualization software for film and video production, and MacVideo, a promotion company that offers exclusive deals on tools for video editors, announce version 3 of Martini , PowerProduction Software’s storyboarding plug-in for Adobe Premiere Pro, Apple Final Cut Pro, Avid Media Composer, and VEGAS Pro. Featuring all-new props, hundreds of new backgrounds, and a powerful new interface, Martini v3 is the ultimate storyboarding tool for video editors. Martini is a revolutionary post-production plug-in that brings the creativity of visualization into video editing. Rather than breaking the flow of a work-in-progress with \"white-text-on-a-black-background\" slugs, Martini easily creates shots that look like scenes that have yet to be shot. Loaded with hundreds of classic and unique shot styles, Martini's easy-to-use interface guides editors through the quick creation of composite shots. Editors can select a style, such as basic over-the-shoulder shots, two and three shots, and close-ups, as well as fight scenes, chase scenes, and other pre-composed multiple shot sequences. Then, editors can choose from hundreds of pre-loaded interiors, exteriors, custom digital location photos, and props. The all-new Martini v3 release includes: Props . Accentuate your scene with Martini’s all-new props. Choose from hundreds of everyday objects such as vehicles, furniture, food, and animals. New Resizable Interface . Martini’s new user interface allows you to expand your workspace, giving you more power and flexibility in pre-visualizing your scenes. Hundreds of New Backgrounds . Martini v3 includes hundreds of all-new exterior and interior locations that are optimized for storyboarding, providing the perfect background for your pre-vis sequences. Plus, it is easier than ever to add your own digital art and photos. Add-on Characters, Props, Locations, and More . On top of all the great-looking graphics that are included with Martini, over 20 new add-on libraries are now available, dramatically expanding your options for customization. Add-On Character Libraries provide the option of integrating different genres, ethnicities, and artistic styles while Add-On Prop Libraries give more detail to your shots and scenes. Free “Stand-In” Character Add-On Library ($20 Value) . When you haven't settled on the features of your main characters but still need to create cinematic shots, the Stand-In library lets you show off your cinematic vision while leaving your casting options wide open. The library includes 6 colorable characters in 6 poses, 3 elevations, and 8 rotations. Martini supports the following video editing applications: Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2017, 2015, CC 2014, CC, CS6, CS5.5, CS5, or CS4 for Mac or Win Avid Media Composer v8.x, v7.x, or v6.x for Mac or Win Apple Final Cut Pro X, v7, or v6 MAGIX VEGAS Pro v14 Sony VEGAS Pro v13 or v12 MAGIX VEGAS Movie Studio Suite v14 Sony VEGAS Movie Studio Suite v13 or v12 Pricing and Availability Martini is available for purchase from www.martiniquickshot.com for $99 USD.

      "text": "Spammers have discovered a new method to infiltrate your life. Over the past few months, Apple users have been reporting strange iCal invites from miscellaneous accounts that clearly aren't legitimate. These fake invites are hard to handle: Unlike email, calendar invites can't be marked as spam, and declining the invites will alert the spammers that the iCloud account is active — which could lead to even more invites. What are you supposed to do?\ncool new icloud feature: calendar spam\nAn iOS update would best remedy this situation, but there are a couple workarounds that can help you in the meantime. Here's what you can do if you receive spam calendar invites:\nReroute push notifications to iCloud email By default iCal will send event invites to your iPhone as a push notification, but you can change this setting to reroute invites to your iCloud email. Not only will this prevent fake invites from bombarding your phone, but your email account should identify these events as spam and rightly filter them as such.\nTo change this setting, you'll have to visit the iCloud Calendar page on a computer (you can't access iCloud.com on mobile Safari). Click on the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the screen to access Settings. From that menu, select Preferences. Then hit the Advanced tab and change the Invitations option from \"In-App Notifications\" to \"Email to iCloud Address.\"\nThere is a downside to this: Now all calendar events will be sent to your iCloud email, meaning you'll have to routinely check it if you want to see invites from family or friends.\nDisable the iCloud calendar The above option is suited for users who actively use iCal — this one is for those who don't ( Google Calendar is better anyway, right? ). If your iCloud calendar is expendable, just head to your iPhone's Settings and select iCloud to disable the app. All push notifications from the spammers will halt.",

      "text": "If the long lines and nonstop shopping on Black Friday 2016 and Cyber Monday 2016 didn't give you enough of a workout, we've got you covered. Staying in shape over the holidays can be difficult and holiday meals are not exactly conducive to a healthy diet. Enter this year's crop of tech-y — and very stylish — fitness trackers and smartwatches that keep time and track your essentials.\nPicking the perfect smartwatch these days can be tricky with the ever-increasing range of options top brands are offering. So here's a curated selection of the fitness trackers and smartwatches worth checking out over the holidays.\nApple Watch 2 Apple Watch 2 Source: Richard Vogel/AP The Apple Watch 2 , unveiled in September, features an onboard GPS system to help track any fitness-related workout, regardless of where you are. It's also got a water-resistant design for rain-soaked runs, and a customizable activity tracker.\nApple's special partnership with Nike and Hermès also brings us a separate roster of watches that come with their own custom features, like leather straps and bands.\nThe device's unique operating system, watchOS 3, comes pre-installed on each second-gen device. The third watchOS features lightning-fast responses and new apps like \" Breathe \" that are designed to help workout warriors relax. It claims up to 18 hours of battery life, which is a little disappointing, but the smartwatch's overall software and hardware upgrades make it a go-to wrist companion for any iPhone user. The upgrade provides a much smoother experience than its predecessor.\n— Apple: $369 to $1,249 (depending on style)\n— Macy's: $369 to $1, 099 (depending on style)\nHuawei Fit Huawei Fit Source: Huawei/Huawei Inc. Unlike the Apple Watch, the sharp-looking Huawei Fit actually looks like a watch, with classic analog aesthetics. The device boasts a circular water-resistant screen, metal casing and swappable straps.\nS ince Huawei is part of Google's ever-expanding Android universe, the devices have access to the company's downloadable Google Fit companion app that logs and tracks daily, weekly and monthly fitness progress.\nHowever, buyers beware: Despite its otherwise stellar list of features — customizable fitness plans, real-time coaching, heart rate monitoring and up to six days of battery life — it lacks built-in GPS, which makes tracking distance in real time more difficult. Still, its cost might make it hard to pass up.\n— Amazon: $99.99 to $178 (depending on style)\n— Best Buy: $99.99\nPebble 2 + Heart Rate Pebble 2 Source: Pebble/Pebble.com The Pebble 2 is a marked improvement from its forerunner, the Pebble Steel. Overall, it's a decent buy.\nThe smartwatch operates more like a fitness tracker and less like a watch masquerading as a health device. Day-to-day step, calorie and sleep tracking run automatically and don't require users to download third-party apps in order to work. The device has scratch-resistant glass, heart rate monitoring, voice activation and up to seven days of battery life — meaning you're less likely to run out of juice while working out.\n— Best Buy: $129.99\n— Pebble: $129.99\nMotorola Moto 360, 2nd generation Moto 360 Source: Motorola/Motorola For workout beginners, the Moto 360 — which sends you notifications throughout the day to keep you motivated — may be the best smartwatch on the list. Through Moto's dedicated health app, Moto Body , the wearable provides workout summaries broken down by heart rate, steps walked, calories burned and more.\nThe app also provides personalized fitness recommendations and keeps tabs on workout pace, duration and distance in an effort to help users reach the weekly 150 minutes of physical activity recommended by the American Heart Association.\nYou can get activity emails that sum up weekly fitness achievements once a week so you can better analyze your progress on larger screens. It's a feature that somewhat makes up for the device's poor battery life: The watch lasts up to 1.5 days on average.\n— A mazon $329.99\n— Best Buy: $269.99 to $360.99 (depending on style)\nSamsung Gear S3 Samsung Frontier (left) and Samsung Classic (right) Source: Mark Lennihan/AP Once you get past the Samsung Gear S3 's steep price point, you'll be pleasantly surprised by what the wearable has to offer. The device comes in two styles: the sports-like Frontier and more conventional-looking Classic .\nWhile the device's slightly larger than normal watch face may be off-putting for some, it's a fair trade-off for a battery life that c an last up to four days and its roster of fitness tracking features.\nBesides the Google Fit app, the device includes email, phone and text notifications and onboard GPS so you can leave your phone at home and rest assured that your calories and heart rate are logged. A built-in mic and speakers are great for consumers who need to answer calls hands-free or take notes post-workout .\n— A mazon: $349.99 to $449\n— Best Buy: $349.99 (depending on style)\nMisfit Phase The Misfit Phase Source: Misfit Misfit's \"hybrid\" smartwatch, the Phase , combines features from its line of fitness trackers with the aesthetics of a classic watch.

      "text": "Apple’s AirPort Routers Rank High In Customer Satisfaction   19:24 PST \nAbout a week ago, it was reported that Apple had disbanded the team that was working on their wireless router products , such as the AirPort Express, AirPort Extreme, and AirPort Time Capsule. It is unclear why this happened, but presumably Apple is trying to streamline their offerings by letting other people make it for them. \nHowever it seems that by doing so, Apple could be missing out on a huge opportunity. According to a new study released by J.D. Power (via MacRumors ), it has been found that Apple’s AirPort routers have ranked the highest amongst wireless router manufacturers in terms of customer satisfaction. This means that for some reason, Apple has decided to kill a product that was doing very well amongst customers. \nIt is possible that maybe Apple isn’t making as much money from its AirPort routers, which means that even though customers are satisfied, it isn’t profitable enough for Apple to keep around when they can focus their efforts on other products and projects. The study found that Apple beat out brands like ASUS, D-Link, TP-Link, and Netgear, just to name a few. \nWill this survey change Apple’s mind at whether or not they should exit the router market? It seems unlikely, especially after Apple killed its Thunderbolt Display in favor of a partnership with LG , despite the fact that Thunderbolt Displays were loved by users in spite of its hefty price tag. \nFiled in Apple > Gadgets .

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "title": "iPhone battery problems are much more widespread than Apple admits, Chinese authorities say",
      "text": "A mysterious problem causing iPhones to unexpectedly shut down is much larger than Apple has admitted to, Chinese authorities say, and affects iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, and iPhone 6s Plus devices—not just the iPhone 6s.\nThe China Consumers Association, a government watchdog group, said Nov. 30 that Apple needs to take further measures to address the problem, and accused the company of failing to “meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication.” The notice is the second the group has sent to Apple in a month, and illustrates how Beijing has become one of the toughest overseers of the Cupertino-based hardware maker.\nConsumers in China and the rest of the world have complained in recent weeks that their iPhones are shutting down, even though their batteries reportedly still have 30% power remaining. On Nov. 20, Apple published a global notice addressing the problem. A “very small number of iPhone 6s devices” produced between September and October 2015 “may unexpectedly shut down,” the company said. Consumers whose phone matched a serial number on Apple’s website could bring their device to an Apple Store or authorized reseller and replace the battery for free.\nThat doesn’t go far enough, though, the China Consumer Association said in the Nov. 30 notice (link in Chinese). It wants Apple to offer fixes for other models experiencing the malfunction, and to provide a more thorough explanation of why it is happening:\nAfter Apple published the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,” many consumers continued to send replies to the China Consumers Association reporting their situation. After collecting these reports, we discovered the shutdown malfunction also exists in the iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus, in addition to iPhone 6s devices produced between September and October 2015. The aforementioned models were among the devices suspected of malfunction problems in the China Consumer Associations’ letter sent out on November 15. Meanwhile, consumers have opinions and suggestions about the execution of Apple’s “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues.”\nAs a result, on November 29, the China Consumer Association once again sent a letter to Apple expressing our wish that Apple provide a thorough analysis, reason and solution for the malfunctioning iPhone 6, iPhone 6 Plus, iPhone 6s Plus and iPhone 6s phones produced between September and October 2015. In addition, as for the “iPhone 6s Program for Unexpected Shutdown Issues,”some consumers have questions about its terms and [we] ask for a timely clarification. [We also request] Apple improve the convenience of the booking and consultation systems [for battery replacement], prepare enough components to replace batteries efficiently, and meet basic consumer needs for normal wireless communication.\nMaking the matter potentially worse, some Chinese consumers are complaining that Apple’s battery replacement does not solve the shutdown issue.\nOn Weibo, China’s Twitter-esque social network, one Wuhan-based iPhone 6s wrote that he received a fresh battery for his faulty iPhone 6s on Nov. 29. The following day, it shut down at 20%. This suggests that the problem might be deeper than Apple expected. “I just want to ask Apple how changing the battery will fix the problem,” he wrote on Weibo today (Dec. 1).\nQuartz reached out to Apple for comment but did not receive an immediate reply.",

Bank of America will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. Also Read: iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review: The best iPhones Apple has made \nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. \nThe (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause. \nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. \n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs, who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006.

Customers were asked to no longer use the phones, and Galaxy Note 7s have since been banned or discouraged from use on flights, buses and other public areas.\nThe video of the iPhone 6 Plus posted Wednesday morning shows the device meeting a similar fate to one of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7s.\nIphone 6 plus catches fire after breaking @Apple @WORLDSTAR pic.twitter.com/AA3TpjNOEC\n— nash (@nashwest2) November 30, 2016 Shares of Apple were down 0.61% to $110.78 mid-Wednesday morning.\nIn the 2016 third quarter, Cupertino, CA-based Apple held a 12.5% worldwide market share in the smartphone area, versus Samsung's 20.0% market share, according to IDC. The gap was somewhat narrower than in the second quarter, when Apple held an 11.7% market share compared with Samsung's 22.8%. Most of Samsung's Galaxy Note 7 issues took place in the fourth quarter.\nApple released its new iPhone 7 and 7 Plus in September to a stronger-than expected reception, and IDC said that the device \"could witness greater success come next quarter as it stands to likely benefit from the Note 7 recall that took place [in October.]\"\nWednesday's supposed fire is reminiscent of two separate reports in October that iPhone 6 Plus models had caught fire, ABC30 reported.\nAn Apple spokesman said that the company is looking into the issue.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "Apple wants everyone seeing RED for World AIDS Day Wednesday Nov 30, 2016 at 1:00 PM Hayley Tsukayama - The Washington Post \nApple fans, get ready to see red: Apple is using its ubiquitous presence to raise awareness and money for the AIDS awareness campaign Red on World AIDS Day. \nExpanding on the growing attention the company has paid to charitable events under chief executive Tim Cook, the company on Thursday will release several products to raise money for the AIDS awareness project co-founded by U2 frontman Bono. \nThe goal? To achieve a generation that is AIDS-free at birth, by ending cases where mothers transmit the disease to their children. Deb Dugan, chief executive of Red, said she believes that goal could be accomplished by 2020. \nApple has planned some new ways to raise money this year. \n\"We've deeply thought through every single way our customers touch us. And we've tried to make it really simple for them to participate in eradicating this disease,\" Cook said. \nThese include working with outside app developers to raise money for the charity, special red versions of product cases and an appropriately hued Beats wireless speaker and headphones. The company will turn the logos red at more than 400 of its stores. It is making a documentary about Red, \"The Lazarus Effect,\" free to all iTunes users. And it has worked with the band The Killers to release a special track on iTunes - a rendition of \"I'll Be Home for Christmas\" - and will donate 100 percent of the proceeds to Red. \nApple will also donate to Red $1 from every purchase made through Apple Pay at any of its stores (online or not) up to $1 million; Bank of America will match that donation for Apple Pay payments made with its cards from Dec. 1-7. \nBeing able to inspire broad participation, Cook said, is Apple's most important charitable responsibility. \n\"That has much more value to it, I think, then just merely writing a check,\" he said. \"This is about getting an enormous amount of people, and trying to be the ripple in the pond.\" \nThe companywide effort is the largest Apple has undertaken for a cause - even under Cook, who has raised Apple's philanthropic profile and used his position to speak out on social issues. \nCook declined to comment on whether he thinks Apple - which has championed issues such as LGBT rights and environmental protection - will find itself at odds with the incoming administration. But he rejected the idea that Apple's decision to take a stand on issues such as eradicating AIDS should be viewed through a political lens. \n\"We think . . . corporations should have values like people do - and do their part in leaving things better than we found it,\" Cook said. \"I view all of this stuff as being as far away as you can get from politics as possible, to be honest.\" HealthGrove | Graphiq \nThis year's efforts take a decade of Apple participation with Red to a new level, Cook said. Apple was a founding partner of the charity Project Red - often stylized (RED) - after Bono and philanthropist Bobby Shriver founded it in 2006. The first Apple product for Project Red was a special red iPod nano. It was so popular that Apple had to reissue a second model within four weeks, said Greg Joswiak, Apple's vice president of iPhone and iOS product marketing. \nThis year, it has moved its efforts far beyond the iPod - although you still will be able to buy red iPods to support the cause. The company worked with the developers of several games including Angry Birds, Best Fiends, SimCity BuildIt, Candy Crush Jelly Saga, and Clash of Clans to create special in-app purchases. All of the proceeds from those purchases will go to Red. \nRed has raised $360 million to fight AIDS over the past decade. What many may not realize, however, is that Apple has raised one-third of that: $120 million. \n\"For us it's been a game-changer, quite frankly,\" Dugan said. Although AIDS may not be viewed as quite the crisis that it was in the 1990s, she said it's still the leading cause of death among women of reproductive age and the second-leading cause of death among teens. And, she said, the world is at a crucial moment in the fight to eventually wipe it out. \"We can eliminate mother-child transmission of HIV - which for an infectious disease is a tipping point,\" Dugan said.

      "title": "This is why your iPhone 7’s battery might die in a year",
      "text": "There’s a new battery issue plaguing various models of Apple’s phone, including the iPhone 6s. Though we should expect Apple to investigate and fix the bug that causes unexpected shutdowns even when the battery is more than 30% full , users should also understand how these iPhone batteries work. Just like any other battery, they age. The more you use them — and phones do need constant charging — the more likely the battery is to degrade. In fact, even if you buy a brand new iPhone 7 right now, you might still run into battery issues a year from now. DON’T MISS: There’s a fix for your iPhone 6s’ serious battery drain, but you might not like it \nAlthough Apple is currently offering a free battery replacement program for the iPhone 6s, the severe battery draining bug affects other iPhones as well, including the iPhone 6 and iPhone 5s. In order to understand why this happens, you should watch a new video from Business Insider  that perfectly illustrates how a Lithium-ion battery works, and explains why you can expect its maximum capacity to drop over time.\nIt’s the actual components of the battery that cause the problem. The chemical reaction inside the battery is what makes it tick. But it’s also responsible for its demise. The more battery charging cycles you put it through, the more likely you are to drop the maximum theoretical charge.\nBasically, Lithium ions build up over time and cripple battery life.\nGiven that you charge your iPhone almost every day, you’re likely to get more than 300 cycles a year. Maybe significantly more than that. And a mobile battery will drop 20% in charge after 400 cycles, the video explains. The fact that the battery is relatively small doesn’t help either.\nSo in about a year after you buy the brand new iPhone 7, or any other smartphone with a similar battery consumption cycle, you might experience battery issues.\nCheck out Business Insider ‘s video at the source link below.\nTrending right now: \nAll of the new features the Android 7.0 Nougat update will bring to the Galaxy S7 What it takes to get a NES Classic Leak reveals another key Galaxy S8 feature that has never been seen before on an iPhone See the original version of this article on BGR.com",

      "text": "World AIDS Day: Tim Cook on Apple's Fight Against AIDS With RED Charity Reddit \nApple Inc is expanding its support for the fight against AIDS through the (RED) charity founded by rock singer Bono, Chief Executive Tim Cook said in an interview ahead of World AIDS Day. \nOver the next week, the company will expand its line of (RED) products and donate $1 for each transaction made using mobile payment Apple Pay in its physical and online stores, up to a total of $1 million. Bank of America will contribute up to that sum for Apple Pay transactions using its cards. \n\"There's still way too many people dying of AIDS, still too many kids being born with HIV, and so we are continuing to press really hard,\" Cook said in the interview. \nUNAIDS predicts the number of babies born with HIV could drop to near zero by 2020 from around 400 per day now, Apple said. The (RED) campaign is an example of \"cause-related marketing,\" a style of philanthropy that some critics say is self-serving because they promote corporate brands as much as the underlying cause.\nCook told Reuters that Apple can have a far greater impact by raising awareness among consumers than by simply writing a check. \"When we put ourselves into something, it's worth a lot more than just money,\" he said. \n(RED) was one of Apple's highest profile philanthropic efforts under former Chief Executive Steve Jobs , who largely avoided corporate giving. The company has been responsible for about $120 million of the $360 million (RED) has raised since it was founded in 2006. \n© Thomson Reuters 2016",

      "text": "To Tim Cook, Apple’s support of (RED), an advocacy group that raises money and awareness in an effort to combat AIDS, is a natural outgrowth of the company’s values. But maintaining corporate inclusiveness while having a clear civic agenda may be a challenge, observers say.\nOn Dec. 1, on World AIDS Day, Apple will decorate 400 of its stores with (RED) signs, up from around 100 stores last year. Customers will have the opportunity to learn about the impact of AIDS across the globe while purchasing a range of red-colored products. A portion of profits from certain games and apps will be sent to the charity, which feeds into the Global Fund to fight AIDS. Even Apple Pay is involved, with the company donating $1 (up to $1 million) for each item purchased using the tool. Bank of America will match the donation for Apple Pay purchases made on its cards.\nApple sees its ongoing involvement with (RED) as part of a responsibility to protect rights, Apple CEO Tim Cook told USA Today, saying that all corporations should have values, “because people should have values. And corporations are just a bunch of people .”\nRecommended: Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! But corporate values can be controversial, as events during the past year have shown. So how can companies do the most good? By finding the values that people can agree on, experts say.\nTest your knowledge Who owns Gatorade: Coke or Pepsi? Take our 'parent company' quiz! “The values need to be broad and inclusive,” Jeffrey Moriarty, associate professor of philosophy and chair of the philosophy department at Bentley University in Boston, tells The Christian Science Monitor in an email, adding, “We live in a diverse world, and firms need to be respectful of that.”\nAccording to Patrick Lencioni, who writes on business management, Jim Collins and Jerry Porras’s 1994 book \"Built to Last\" sparked the current drive by CEOs to establish corporate values. But in a 2002, Harvard Business Review article, Mr. Lencioni took aim at the bland values statements of many organizations, which, he wrote, “create cynical and dispirited employees, alienate customers, and undermine managerial credibility .”\nLiving a company’s values, by contrast, can set a company apart and inspire employees. It may discourage unethical behavior, writes Mark Schwartz, associate professor of business ethics at York University in Toronto, in an email to the Monitor. And it can bring financial benefits too.\n“Some studies have shown that companies with a clear set of values financially outperform other competing companies in the long-term,” Professor Schwartz notes.\nLencioni argues these benefits come with a price. Values can “inflict pain,” making some employees feel that they don’t belong even as they place demands on everyone.\nThey can be divisive, as well. Some Donald Trump supporters have chosen to boycott Oreos and Amazon. (Trump has spoken out against both Mondelez International, the parent of Oreo-maker Nabisco, because the company is moving some of its Chicago operations to Mexico, and Amazon, due to CEO Jeff Bezos's ownership of The Washington Post). Likewise, Chik-fil-A faced consumer ire for donating to groups that opposed same-sex marriage.\nMr. Cook, who has backed causes from LGBT rights to internet privacy in the past, told The Independent that Apple’s engagement with (RED) is not political – and so it might not be expected to be problematic.\n“These things are about humanity,” he said.\nAnd many people see companies’ involvement with charitable causes as a step forward from a time when they were motivated purely by the bottom line. But while Prof. Moriarty agrees that Apple has tremendous potential to do good through its charitable partnerships, he believes the limited discussion of a company’s corporate activism can be problematic.\n“Who exactly is choosing corporate values – both the ends the corporation will pursue and the means to those ends?… In all likelihood, it’s Tim Cook, some other high-ranking executives, and some members of the board,” Moriarty writes.\nHe suggests that firms encourage all employees to weigh in on what they believe the company’s priorities should be.\nAfter surveying employees, Schwartz recommends carrying out training and other initiatives to get the organization moving in the chosen direction. And with more people involved, companies’ direction should more closely reflect popular attitudes.\nBoth professors agree that most people should be able to agree on a set of values. Schwartz calls these “ethical” values, listing integrity, respect, and fairness, among others. Moriarty points to health, life, and family. Adopting these corporate values, they suggest, provides a solid foundation for responsible business, whatever political and social stances companies they choose to take. Apple’s commitment to matching employees’ charitable contributions may be one effort to support a broad range of causes.\n“Business has the power to bring people together, but not if all business activity has a political aspect or element to it,” Moriarty writes.",

      "text": "Apple might not have been doing well globally — the company recently posted first annual revenue decline in 15 years since 2001 — but its India unit seems to be doing insanely well. Apple had earlier announced that iPhone sales in India grew by 50 percent compared to same time last year and now Apple has become the second-largest smartphone maker in India by revenue for the financial year ending March 2016. The company has successfully managed to do this by piping the country’s largest home-grown brand Micromax, and touching sales milestone of Rs 10,000 crore in less than 10 years of its operations. Based on the balance filed on November 30, Apple India sales grew by 54 percent to Rs 9,997.1",

      "text": "Rec Harry Carmichael As work continues on downtown Chicago’s flashy new Apple store, the outline of the 20,000-square-foot building and its riverfront staircase is beginning to show. Designed by London architecture firm Foster+Partners and costing nearly $27 million , the construction site at 401 N. Michigan has installed blue ductwork for the project’s forced air system. Meanwhile, the vertical steel pylons that will eventually support the weight of Mr. Foster’s wide, prairie-inspired roof have recently poked over the fencing separating the site from Pioneer Court. It’s not just the high-visibility riverfront plaza that’s set to receive the Apple corporate design treatment. Below street level, the store’s entrance on Lower Michigan Avenue already features futuristic metal cladding and large illuminated lettering reflecting the new development’s address. Under construction since March , the new retail space will replace Apple’s current Mag Mile location five blocks to the north. So far, the tech company has been quiet regarding the estimated completion date of its latest Chicago store. Harry Carmichael",
