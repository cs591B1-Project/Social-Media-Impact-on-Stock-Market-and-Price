      "text": "Image Credit: Mike Mozart/Flickr \nVerizon is getting close to its first large scale trials of a high-speed wireless video service to compete with cable television. \nThe company will roll out the service, which is based on the upcoming 5G wireless standard, in several small towns by the end of March, CEO Lowell McAdam said on Tuesday. The goal is to provide high-speed connectivity for TV and Internet service to homes and businesses without needing to run fiber optic lines to every customer. \n“We won’t be charging for the service, but we will be learning from it and figuring out the distance between the transmitter and the receiver in a 5G environment,” McAdam said at a UBS investor conference in New York. \nVerizon has long touted the upcoming 5G standard, which can be up to 100 faster than current 4G wireless service, as the basis for a new cable and Internet service. The 5G technology is needed for Verizon’s six year, $300 million plan to offer TV and Internet in Boston, for example. But McAdam had not previously given the early 2017 timeline and additional details about Verizon’s efforts. \nThe carrier is looking for ways to save money and crack new markets as growth in its two main lines of business, wired and wireless phone service, have slowed. In addition to 5G video service, McAdam has also targeted service for smart, connected devices in the Internet of things and online advertising, via the acquisition of AOL and pending purchase of Yahoo. \nVerizon’s Fios unit, which offers TV and Internet service, largely ceased expanding years ago because of the expense of building fiber optic lines to customers. \nBut the 5G wireless plan could dramatically reduce those costs. A customer would only need a typical router placed by a window to receive signals for Internet and TV service from a neighborhood-based cell tower. Verizon has even discussed deploying more numerous microcells, with new technology that can put a 5G transmitter inside a street light, for example. \n“This will allow you to stop anywhere from 200 feet to 1,000 feet, somewhere in that range, we think, from the home and then make it a wireless last leg into the home,” McAdam explained. “And I think that is going to be the predominant architecture for wireless service going forward.” \nThis story originally appeared on Fortune.com .

      "text": "City OKs license for Verizon to sell FiOS service Jordan Graham Wednesday, December 07, 2016 comments Three years ago, Donnie Wahlberg walked the streets of Boston, touting Verizon FiOS in a city that didn’t have it — and prompting a social media storm in the process from people who were irked by that. Today, FiOS is finally available in the Hub.\nVerizon will begin installing its high-speed fiber optic internet and cable TV service in Boston after the city approved a license allowing the company to begin operating in the city, introducing competition after decades of exclusive service by Comcast.\n“Boston’s residents need fast, reliable communications services built on the latest technologies,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “I look forward to working with Verizon to bring more choice and upgraded technology to Boston’s residents and businesses.”\nIn parts of Roslindale, Dorchester and West Roxbury, Verizon technicians will begin installing the service today. The company said it has already installed 160 miles of fiber optic cable in Boston, enough to connect to 25,000 homes right now.\nThe service will be expanded further into those neighborhoods next year, with other parts of the city coming online later. Verizon has said it will spend $300 million to wire the entire city with FiOS.\n“This shows what’s possible when the public and private sector are both willing to try a new approach to deploying fiber optic technology,” said Bob Mudge, executive vice president for strategic initiatives at Verizon.",

This indicates that the Nougat beta will almost definitely see updates even through Christmas.\nWe don’t know what happened to cause this exclusion, but we do know that Verizon has exerted its influence over the Galaxy S phones it does carry — opting for heavy doses of post-load software and disabling major features in its favor.\nThe post Verizon Galaxy S7 Nougat beta ends before rest of the world appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "Verizon CEO Views Go90 Service As “Patient Money” December 6, 2016 - Written By Daniel Fuller \nMany streaming solutions out there are a one-shot ordeal, and were, for the most part, fully fleshed out from the moment that they hit the scene. Even among carrier-sponsored content delivery services, the current trend is for something to be rife with content and ready to use to its full potential right out of the gate, as seen with AT&T’s DIRECT Now . Verizon, on the other hand, seems to be taking it a bit slow with their own Go90 streaming service. Having scooped up AOL, and working on scooping up Yahoo, Verizon will have plenty of content to work with, but they’re focusing more on adapting Go90 to their business model and target audience by refining the service and being choosy about content. \nVerizon’s CEO, Lowell McAdam spoke on the matter, saying that the company knew from the get go that they would not be seeing instant jumps in revenue from Go90, nor were they expecting it to become a full-fledged content ecosystem overnight. McAdams called the venture “patient money”, referring to the fact that Go90 would generate large streams of revenue over time, mostly by driving mobile user growth and retention, rather than by generating money directly. This very Google-esque way of doing things is not exactly unique in the wireless industry, but Go90 is one of the most overt examples that one can currently see in popular media concerning the mobile industry, and it’s certainly one of the clearest examples. Verizon is spending a good amount of money, time, and manpower to enrich a content ecosystem that they’re offering at low or no cost to their users not to see money directly from it, but for it to help grow their core business. \nAccording to McAdam, the way that the service is being built out and marketed appeals more to modern consumers like millennials, who may not be quite as big on the concept of an all you can eat content buffet at a set price, but tend more toward a la carte offerings that allow them to devote their money and time only to the content that they are personally interested in. McAdam also said that this demographic is a more internet-savvy and online-focused crowd than others, and that a web-centric, customizable offering with a wide variety of content seemed to fit the bill. Go90 isn’t exactly building in slow motion, but it will take time to see if this gamble pays off for Big Red. Post navigation",

Unfortunately, those who own them and were part of the Galaxy Beta program until now will have to wait for the official firmware release, because Verizon Wireless has decided to pull out of it. \"Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team,\" says a recent announcement displayed in the Galaxy Beta app. Verizon customers who were part of the program until now can choose to keep the current beta firmware or completely drop the program and return to the latest official update, which is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow . The final Android Nougat release for their handsets will probably land in early 2017, but the date has not been made official yet.  ",

The latest, the Moto 360 2nd Gen, was announced more than a year ago and will likely remain the flagship wearable for some time. Verizon Wireless has just slashed the prices of both Moto 360 2nd Gen versions by more than 30% - you can get the 42mm Men version with a leather strap for $199.99, which is 33% down the MSRP of $299.99, while the 46mm Men unit will cost you $239.99, 31% down from the MSRP of $349.99. If you're a manly man that wants to put that all-metal version of the wearable on their wrist, you'd be pleased to find out that Verizon has shed 30% off its $399.99 MSRP and is currently selling it for $279.99. Sounds like a steal! Additionally, the 42mm Women Moto smartwatch is also on sale – both the leather and the all-metal ones will set you down some $239.99, which is a 27% discount off their $329.99 MSRP. Yet, that's not all! Buying any of the discounted smartwatches also gets you a $50 Visa prepaid card for free. Just make sure to use the STOCKUP code during your checkout. If that's not a nice promotion, we don't know what is. Motorola Moto 360 2nd Gen Popular galleries",

Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted:   Both the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge are popular devices on Verizon Wireless, and these devices are expected to get the Android Nougat update quite soon. Unfortunately, those who own them and were part of the Galaxy Beta program until now will have to wait for the official firmware release, because Verizon Wireless has decided to pull out of it. \"Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team,\" says a recent announcement displayed in the Galaxy Beta app. Verizon customers who were part of the program until now can choose to keep the current beta firmware or completely drop the program and return to the latest official update, which is based on Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow . The final Android Nougat release for their handsets will probably land in early 2017, but the date has not been made official yet.  ",

      "title": "AT&T To Kick Off 5G Trial At Intel | Gospelherald.com",
      "text": "Comment AT&T joins Verizon in 5G testing. AT&T \nHow has your mobile Internet surfing experience been to date? Do you remember in the early days when you could simply go online, that alone was a pleasure? After all, it was a novelty back then -- not to mention a very expensive one. After GPRS arrived, then came EDGE which clearly proved to be a whole lot faster in terms of getting data back and forth on your mobile device, and users wanted more. What about video streaming and the like? This was when 3G technology started to knock on our front doors, and we gladly opened it to let it in. However, over the course of time, things have also changed -- and this meant that 3G speeds were insufficient for the more dynamic apps as well as mobile data consumption patterns among users, which led to the introduction of 4G LTE speeds. Now that we are more or less used to 4G LTE speeds being the “norm” on our smartphones, we thirst for even more, and 5G technology would come into play. AT&T is one carrier who certainly means business with this aspect of mobile data, which is why the company is about to kick off a 5G trial with the folks at Intel for an entire month, making this the first kind of trial for a business that is located in the US to date. \nWhile 5G technology that boasts of multi-gigabit cellular speeds will most probably remain under wraps and undergo even more testing for the moment, it will most probably hit the market only some time in 2020 , which is a fair number of years from now. However, it looks like Intel employees will be able to obtain a taster of it speeds in this very first customer trial. \nThe Intel facility that will benefit from this particular 5G trial will be located in Austin, Texas. It will make use of just a single cell site, which will cover an extremely limited area. We are looking at a radius of approximately 300 meters, that’s all. Pretty little, don’t you think so? That would mean just a few people being able to take advantage of it at any one time taking into consideration just how large the facility might be. \nWhy Intel? That should not be too difficult to answer, especially when Intel has been looking into the kind of technologies possible for 5G client and network equipment in an aggressive manner. Not only that, Intel is also another major contributor to smartphone innards apart from Qualcomm, and this is one area where the mobile device industry needs major players in the game in order to continue eking out advancements in technologies constantly. \nOver at the Intel trial, AT&T intends it to be an exercise where it shows just how 5G technology is able to speed up business applications such as VPNs (virtual private networks) and unified communications. Of course, it is a no-brainer that 4K video and regular Internet access are also part of the mix, and cable broadband could just get some competition in this aspect in the near future. ",

      "text": "The major indexes are back in rally mode even after heady gains in recent weeks. As of 2:45 PM New York time on Tuesday, the Nasdaq composite, S&P 500 and Dow Jones industrials all rallied with gains of 0.1% to 0.4%.\nMeanwhile, Dow 30 components Verizon Communications ( VZ ) and Apple ( AAPL ) helped lead the market's upside with gains of 1.4% and 0.6%, respectively. Also up within the Dow: financial plays Goldman Sachs ( GS ) (up the biggest amount points wise among the 30, rising 2.59 or 1.1%) and American Express ( AXP ) (up 0.4%).\nSmall cap names lagged a little bit, with the Russell 2000 up 0.3%.\nThe NYSE Composite led the way with a 0.5% boost higher. Diversified operations, auto retailing, staffing, air conditioning and heating, movide and airline stocks paced the upside, all up 1.8% or more. The market also saw strength in fabless semiconductor, homebuilding, auto parts and life insurance plays.\nApple, gaining some steam following news that CEO Tim Cook defended the strength of Apple Watch sales during the holiday shopping season, is still a laggard among most large- and mega-cap names. With a weak 51 RS Rating and a poor Accumulation/Distribution Rating of D+, the former huge winner from 2004 to 2015 needs to prove it has the institutional support to finish a new base and stage a new breakout.\nThe current action is encouraging in the sense that Apple has held above its 200-day moving average, but it's still below its 50-day moving average.\nOne key IBD rule is to avoid stocks that \"live\" below the 10-week moving average (see a weekly chart) for nine weeks or more. Such behavior indicates flagging demand among mutual funds, hedge funds, pensions, insurers, banks and large investment advisors.\nVerizon, a big winner in the first half of 2016, is up 1.4% to 50.47. The stock recently rebounded back above its 50-day moving average. Watch to see if it can climb back above its 200-day line, which flattened out last month. Q4 profit is expected to be flat at 89 cents a share.\nVerizon's integrated telecom services group is now a laggard, ranked in the bottom half of IBD's daily ranking of 197 industry groups. Group peer AT&T ( T ) is also in base-building mode, up nearly 2% to 39.36 and just shy of possibly retaking its own 200-day moving average. The broadband and telecom giant had rallied 25% after breaking out past a 35.09 saucer with handle buy point before beginning its current correction.\nElsewhere in the stock market today , large-cap and mega-cap names showing more strength include Broadcom ( AVGO ), part of IBD Leaderboard ; Lockheed Martin ( LMT ), a defense play and hovering near a 267.03 cup entry; and JPMorgan Chase ( JPM ), which has moved past a tight, narrow consolidation at 80.54 and gave advanced traders an aggressive entry point to add a small amount of shares to a winning position.\nJPMorgan, covered frequently in the Stock Market Today column in the summer to early fall, has rallied sharply since clearing a 65.08 narrow cup with handle entry within a long bottoming base pattern.\nIn economic news, unit labor costs for the third quarter jumped a revised 0.7%, up from a 0.3% gain. The new data points to added evidence of wage inflation, which may further cement a decision by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates during a Dec. 13-14 meeting.\nRELATED :\nWhy Apple May Be Creating A New Base \nWhen Did Apple Initially Break Out? \nThe Case For A Trump Era New Secular Bull Run \nApple iPhone Business Outlook Set To Improve Next Year, But China Still A Worry",

Traders currently see a whopping 92 percent chance of a move when the central bank meets next Tuesday and Wednesday, according to Thomson Reuters data.\nDow e-minis were up 19 points, or 0.1 percent at 8:32 a.m. ET, with 19,860 contracts changing hands.\nS&P 500 e-minis were up 4 points, or 0.18 percent, with 128,034 contracts traded.\nNasdaq 100 e-minis were up 10.75 points, or 0.22 percent, on volume of 14,038 contracts.\nA report from the Commerce Department showed U.S. trade deficit rose more-than-expected to $42.6 billion, as exports fell amid declining shipments for soybeans and other goods. Economists had expected a deficit of $41.8 billion.\nHowever, futures' reaction to the data seemed muted.\nA report on factory orders data for October is likely to show new orders rose 2.6 percent in the month after adding 0.3 percent in September. The data is due at 10:00 a.m. ET.\nShares of Verizon rose 0.50 percent to $50 premarket, after the wireless carrier agreed to sell 29 data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion. Shares of Equinix rose 0.58 percent to $334.\nIntralinks soared 15.5 percent to $13.02 after Synchronoss Technologies said it would buy the cloud-based business software provider for $821 million, representing a 15.4 percent premium to Intralinks' Monday close. Synchronoss shares were off 1.6 percent.\nPandora rose 2.8 percent to $13.75 after brokerage Aegis Capital initiated coverage on the online radio company's stock with a \"buy\" rating and a $16 price target.

      "text": "6 ways to keep phone charges low during international travel With the exception of Verizon , carriers typically block your phone from other carriers' plans until you've paid off the hardware, typically after two years. Just visit a kiosk at the airport when you arrive, or stop by a cellphone or convenience store in town. [...] it'll get you email and basic messaging, and it's much cheaper than the $205 Verizon would charge for 100 megabytes without an international plan. Use your hotel's Wi-Fi as much as possible; your Instagram pictures can wait, especially if your friends are asleep anyway. Otherwise, the phone waited until I got back to the hotel's Wi-Fi. On most version of Android, turn on \"Restrict background data\" to blocks apps from using cellular data while running in the background. To let certain apps override that, you need \"Data saver\" on the latest version of Android, Nougat, which isn't yet available on most phones. Get and set up apps for museums and other places you're visiting before you leave home or the hotel. The offline mode isn't meant for walking directions, though what I got for driving was often close enough (The exception was Venice, where cars are banned). [...] there's no offline transit support, but I got transit directions by enabling cellular briefly and used offline mode to get to my stops. Netflix recently updated its app to offer similar downloads for offline viewing.",

      "text": "Verizon to Sell 24 of Its Data Center Sites to Equinix \nThe transaction aligns with Verizon's strategy to focus on driving digital transformation for enterprise customers, not running data centers. Verizon Communications Inc. on Dec. 7 announced it has entered into a definitive agreement to sell 24 data center sites to Redwood City, Calif.-based Equinix in a transaction valued at $3.6 billion. Equinix will own and manage 24 Verizon customer-facing data sites, consisting of 29 data center buildings, in the United States and Latin America. The deal is expected to close by mid-2017. The transaction aligns with Verizon's strategy to focus on driving digital transformation for enterprise customers, not running data centers. The sale does not affect Verizon's managed hosting and cloud offerings, or its data center services delivered from 27 sites in Europe, Asia-Pacific and Canada.Citi and Guggenheim Partners are acting as financial advisors to Verizon. Jones Day is acting as legal advisor to Verizon.Included in the deal for Equinix is Verizon's Miami Network Access Point (NAP), also called the NAP of the Americas. NOTA is a pivotal transit location for data between the U.S and Latin America, in addition to being an interconnection point for about 90 global networks. Equinix, whose data centers provide global interconnection for public and private networks, has been busy incorporating Open Compute Project (OCP) technology designed by Facebook to develop a new open source-based ecosystem inside its International Business Exchange (IBX) data centers. Equinix and Facebook have been collaborating to build a diverse, open source platform for both software and hardware. Building on contributions to OCP, this ecosystem will be built on a new, open source architecture that will enable faster innovation and create greater efficiency in data center and hybrid cloud deployments. To facilitate this ecosystem, Wedge open source switches developed by Facebook and contributed to OCP will be part of the new architecture inside Equinix. By working with Facebook to build this ecosystem, Equinix is able to provide its enterprise customers with an improved environment to push technology boundaries and develop next-generation interconnection networks. Interconnection networks differ from standard data centers in that they serve as crossroads and optimizers for large public and private networks, rather than as physical stations for server, storage and networking equipment. \nChris Preimesberger is Editor of Features and Analysis at eWEEK.

Photo: CHANG W LEE, New York Times Verizon's Houston data center part of $3.6 billion Equinix acquisition 1 / 1 Back to Gallery \nVerizon Communications's Houston data center is one of 24 sites to be acquired by Equinix for $3.6 billion. \nCalifornia-based Equinix is a data and interconnection company that provides Internet and network cloud technology for its customers. \nCompany officials said in a statement that Houston is one of three new markets it will enter when the deal is complete. The overall purchase consists of 29 buildings at 24 sites in 15 cities, which were \"strategic\" acquisitions that will build Equinix's business opportunities in Latin America, according to a company statement. \nRELATED: As PCs decline, Microsoft bets its future on the cloud \nVerizon's Houston data center is a 108,000-square-foot facility near Beltway 8 and Aldine Westfield Road in north Houston. Also included in the sale are Verizon's three Dallas-area data centers in Irving and Richardson. \nEquinix expects to close the cash acquisition by mid-2017. Once complete, the company will have 175 data centers in 43 regions across the Americas, Asia and Europe.",

Today, FiOS is finally available in the Hub.\nVerizon will begin installing its high-speed fiber optic internet and cable TV service in Boston after the city approved a license allowing the company to begin operating in the city, introducing competition after decades of exclusive service by Comcast.\n“Boston’s residents need fast, reliable communications services built on the latest technologies,” said Mayor Martin J. Walsh. “I look forward to working with Verizon to bring more choice and upgraded technology to Boston’s residents and businesses.”\nIn parts of Roslindale, Dorchester and West Roxbury, Verizon technicians will begin installing the service today. The company said it has already installed 160 miles of fiber optic cable in Boston, enough to connect to 25,000 homes right now.\nThe service will be expanded further into those neighborhoods next year, with other parts of the city coming online later. Verizon has said it will spend $300 million to wire the entire city with FiOS.\n“This shows what’s possible when the public and private sector are both willing to try a new approach to deploying fiber optic technology,” said Bob Mudge, executive vice president for strategic initiatives at Verizon.",

      "text": "Verizon to sell data centers to Equinix for $3.6 billion Tue Dec 6, 2016 10:15am EST [ - ] Text [ + ] \n(Reuters) - Verizon Communications Inc VZ.N, the No. 1 U.S. wireless carrier, is selling 29 data centers in the United States and Latin America to Equinix Inc EQIX.O for $3.6 billion, as the telecom giant focuses on its core business. \nThe data centers being sold are located in 15 metro areas, including New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Bogota and Sao Paulo. \nThe sale represents Verizon's efforts to streamline its business and follows the divestment last year of a chunk of its landline business and a portfolio of wireless towers. \nThe enterprise telecommunications industry has had to adapt in recent years to corporate customers seeking more sophisticated and cheaper offerings to manage their data. \nVerizon, which bought data center company Terremark Worldwide for $1.4 billion in 2011, has been facing stiff competition from companies such as T-Mobile US Inc TMUS.N and Sprint Corp S.N, which offer deep discounts on cellphone and data plans. \nVerizon has pivoted to mobile video and advertising by making high-profile acquisitions - it is buying Yahoo for $4.83 billion, and had picked up AOL for $4.4 billion last year. \nReuters reported earlier this year that Verizon had launched an auction to sell the data center assets. \nThe company said about 250 Verizon employees, mainly in the operations functions of the acquired data centers, will become Equinix employees. \nFor Equinix, the world's biggest provider of data centers, the acquisition further bolsters its presence in the Americas.

      "title": "Verizon FiOS expands again, but Verizon’s future is still wireless",
      "text": "Verizon FiOS has begun offering services to customers in Boston, Massachusetts, and services should be available to 25,000 homes and businesses in the city by the end of the year.\nVerizon mostly stopped expanding FiOS fiber-to-the-home service in 2010 and has since then focused on completing existing builds instead of moving into new cities. But the company changed course in April this year when it said it would finally do a large fiber buildout in Boston, replacing the copper lines used to deliver phone, Internet, and TV service. The company has said it's also talking to other cities about possible fiber rollouts. Further Reading Verizon is actually expanding FiOS again, with new fiber in Boston \nResidents of a few Boston neighborhoods are about to see the first fruits of that project.\n\"Verizon is ready to schedule installs for FiOS as soon as today, based on availability,\" the company told Ars. The service can be installed now in Dorchester, Roslindale, and West Roxbury, and it will come to Roxbury’s Dudley Square Innovation District later this month. \"Expansion will continue street-by-street in Dorchester, Roslindale, Roxbury and West Roxbury in 2017,\" Verizon said.\nBoston has issued a cable TV license to Verizon covering just those neighborhoods, but \"the license anticipates future expansion of the service area to additional neighborhoods,\" the city said in an announcement yesterday.\nA joint announcement from Verizon and Boston city officials previously said the project would cost $300 million, take six years, and replace Verizon's \"copper-based infrastructure with a state-of-the-art fiber-optic network platform across the city.\"\nBut how many residents in Boston will get the opportunity to purchase FiOS service remains an open question. The company's license with the city says Verizon may avoid installations in Boston when it is \"commercially impracticable,\" though this exception does not apply to public housing for low-income residents. It's also not clear where Verizon will build after it finishes wiring up the currently planned neighborhoods. We've asked Verizon for an estimate of how many Boston homes will get fiber and will provide an update if we get one.\nGovernment officials in various cities have criticized Verizon for not serving all residents, particularly in low-income areas . In one of the most prominent cases, a city-wide buildout in New York City did not end up reaching all residents, and NYC officials have been fighting Verizon over the matter.\nEnlarge / Verizon workers lay fiber underground in the Boston neighborhood of Roxbury. Verizon Verizon’s wireless future Verizon's Boston project isn't just about fiber-to-the-home; it's also supposed to improve mobile service. \"This partnership will also improve wireless services in Boston by enabling Verizon to attach wireless equipment to city street lights and utility poles, helping residents get fast, reliable mobile service,\" Boston's announcement in April said.\nBut Verizon's wireless ambitions extend beyond mobile connections. In the future, Verizon wants to use wireless technology to deliver home Internet and TV service. In this scenario, Verizon would bring fiber close to homes, but instead of connecting a wire to each house (known as a \"drop\"), it would make the final connection with a wireless link.\nTelecom analyst and longtime Verizon critic Bruce Kushnick recently claimed the Boston fiber deployment is \"vaporware\" and pointed to statements from Verizon that position wireless as a preferred alternative to fiber.\n\"If you think about 5G, you put the fiber down the road, which is what we’re doing in Boston,\" Verizon CFO Fran Shammo said at a recent Goldman Sachs conference . \"Then all of the labor and the expense of drilling up your driveway connecting the [optical network terminal, or ONT] to your house and all the labor involved with that, all that goes away, because now I can deliver a beam... into a window with a credit card-size receptor on it that delivers it to a wireless router, and there’s really no labor involved and there’s no real hardware other than the router and the credit card. So the cost benefit of this is pretty substantial—at least, we believe it is.\"\nVerizon CEO Lowell McAdam made similar statements during an investor call in July . \"About half of our cost to deploy FiOS is in the home today and the next biggest thing outside the home is the drop,\" McAdam said. Verizon can cut costs substantially by \"losing the wiring in the house and losing the drop,\" he said.\nTo that end, Verizon is planning to test a wireless video service for homes. Based on the not-yet-finished 5G standard, the service will be in several small towns by the end of March, and it will be free to the homes in the beta testing areas while Verizon evaluates the technology to prepare a wider rollout, McAdam said at an investor conference this week, according to an article in Fortune. This is separate from the Boston fiber deployment.\n“We won’t be charging for the service [at first], but we will be learning from it and figuring out the distance between the transmitter and the receiver in a 5G environment,” McAdam said.\nBoston could be a logical place for Verizon to test the wireless home service in the future, raising the possibility that some or many Boston homes would be offered wireless links instead of fiber-to-the-premises. But at least for now, the deployment in Boston relies on complete fiber-to-the-home installations, as the company's license from the city speaks of the traditional wire drops to homes and fiber all the way to customer premises. Verizon said it has placed 160 miles of fiber throughout Boston and \"performed hundreds of thousands of fiber optic splices to connect distribution lines and to prepare for eventually connecting fiber directly to homes and businesses that order FiOS.\"",

      "text": "Verizon puts an end to Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge Beta Program By 0 \nVerizon has opened up the Beta program for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge but unfortunately, the mobile network has to cancel it. This isn’t the first time such is being closed but we’re curious to know why. Well, we’re guessing it’s really more because of limitations in number. Verizon has officially made the announcement for S7 and S7 edge owners through the Galaxy Beta application. \nSamsung and Verizon are putting an end to the program so if you haven’t signed up yet, sorry but you have to wait for the official Nougat release next year. We’re expecting a Q1 or Q2 release or maybe just before the Android O is announced. Here is the message that Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 users received: \nDear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team \nIf you are on the Galaxy Beta Program on your S7/S7 Edge smartphone, this only means you will have to remain on the beta version and wait for another Nougat update. You can also opt to exit the program and then go back to the older Android Marshmallow version. We can confirm now that Nougat for Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will not be available before year-end. \nVerizon and Samsung seem to be holding some stuff from Galaxy owners. We’re only speculating because in the past, Verizon has also been denying some features from Samsung device users. There’s the Download Booster and the 15GB Samsung Cloud storage being denied from Galaxy S5 and Note 7 owners. Galaxy Note 5 owners were also not given the Write On PDF feature. They were only added after software updates. We have no idea why Verizon is keeping things from Galaxy owners but we’re assuming there are good reasons.",

      "title": "Verizon begins fiber optic rollout in Boston",
      "text": "Verizon is beginning its $300 million FiOS rollout in the Boston area, eight months after it announced that it was building a fiber optic platform. The rollout is expected to take place over the next six months and the company has already installed more than 160 miles of fiber optic wiring.\nVerizon expects 25,000 addresses will able to connect to FiOS by the end of December In a statement , Verizon’s consumer landline business lead Ken Dixon said FiOS service will be offered to more than 25,000 addresses by the end of December. Rollouts will start in Dudley Square Innovation District and expansion will continue street-by-street in Roxbury, Dorchester, Roslindale, and West Roxbury. \nVerizon put on an optimistic front, calling residents “the winners” of its FiOS launch and its partnership with the City of Boston. Based on Verizon’s past FiOS launch, however, there are good grounds to be skeptical of the actual benefits Boston residents will reap. In 2008, Verizon partnered with New York City’s Department of Information Technology and Telecommunications (DOITT), promising all New York City residents access to fiber by the summer of 2014. What eventuated was a disagreement between DOITT and Verizon over the terms of Verizon’s obligations, when an audit conducted by Mayor Bill de Blasio’s administration and DOITT revealed that there were over 40,000 unfulfilled FiOS requests.\nIn October 2015, 13 Northeastern mayors (including New York) wrote a letter to Verizon’s CEO, Lowell McAdam, criticizing Verizon’s slow FiOS build out, and its “failure to meet contractual or legislative deadlines to make fiber optic cable service available.” The company responded by saying, “In all areas where Verizon has franchises and agreed to deploy FiOS, we have met or surpassed our deployment obligations.”\nAccording to the Boston Herald , Verizon and the City of Boston are still finalizing the term for Verizon’s draft cable license, which Verizon needs to be able to sell and market FiOS.",

      "text": "Verizon has opened up the Beta program for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge but unfortunately, the mobile network has to cancel it. This isn’t the first time such is being closed but we’re curious to know why. Well, we’re guessing it’s really more because of limitations in number. Verizon has officially made the announcement for S7 and S7 edge owners through the Galaxy Beta application.\nSamsung and Verizon are putting an end to the program so if you haven’t signed up yet, sorry but you have to wait for the official Nougat release next year. We’re expecting a Q1 or Q2 release or maybe just before the Android O is announced. Here is the message that Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 users received:\nDear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial. Beta trial users will be upgraded to the commercial N release when it is available early next year. Thanks, Galaxy Beta Program Team\nIf you are on the Galaxy Beta Program on your S7/S7 Edge smartphone, this only means you will have to remain on the beta version and wait for another Nougat update. You can also opt to exit the program and then go back to the older Android Marshmallow version. We can confirm now that Nougat for Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge will not be available before year-end.\nVerizon and Samsung seem to be holding some stuff from Galaxy owners. We’re only speculating because in the past, Verizon has also been denying some features from Samsung device users. There’s the Download Booster and the 15GB Samsung Cloud storage being denied from Galaxy S5 and Note 7 owners. Galaxy Note 5 owners were also not given the Write On PDF feature. They were only added after software updates. We have no idea why Verizon is keeping things from Galaxy owners but we’re assuming there are good reasons.\nVIA: SAMMOBILE\nStory Timeline Samsung FAQ ‘leaks’ start of Android Nougat beta program for the Galaxy S7, starts tomorrow Samsung opens Galaxy Beta Program for Android 7.0 Nougat Galaxy S7, S7 edge owners can try out Nougat in Beta program Samsung Galaxy Beta Program’s Nougat software not compatible with Gear VR Galaxy Beta program for Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge open again",

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nVerizon is playing its part in helping the aid effort following the massive Indonesia earthquake — the company is allowing customers to connect with friends and family in Indonesia for free. \nThe earthquake struck Indonesia’s Aceh province just before dawn on Wednesday, lasting around 15 seconds and causing the deaths of nearly 100 people and the collapse of about 100 buildings in the area. That includes 72 combined shops and dwellings, 15 homes, a gas station, a school, and five mosques. Rescue efforts are hampered by the fact that the local hospital was also damaged in the quake. \nMore: In hot pursuit of Verizon, AT&T begins testing 5G technology in Austin, Texas \n“More than 160,000 Verizon employees worldwide want to support our friends and family in Indonesia who have been impacted by the massive 6.4 earthquake,” said Verizon in a statement. “Verizon is offering free wireless and wireline calling from the U.S. to Indonesia to connect with family and friends.” \nAccording to Verizon, home wireless phone customers will not incur any charges for calls to Indonesia from their landline from December 7-9. Mobile wireless customers won’t incur charges for calls and texts from the U.S. to Indonesia on the same dates. \nVerizon’s announcement highlights the fact that tech companies are playing a bigger and bigger role in helping people connect following a disaster. Facebook in particular has been making an effort to switch on its Safety Check feature, which essentially lets users mark that they’re safe after a disaster takes place, letting all their friends know that they don’t need to worry about them. Facebook has turned the feature on a number of times, including during the Oakland fire that killed 36 people on December 2 and during a recent Ohio State University attack that left seven injured.

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge On Verizon Won't Receive Android 7.0 Nougat Until 2017",
      "text": "Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge On Verizon Won't Receive Android 7.0 Nougat Until 2017 7 December 2016, 9:47 pm EST By Carl Velasco Tech Times Verizon has announced that it will stop providing future Nougat beta updates for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge moving forward. Affected users may either revert to Android 6.0 Marshmallow or stay in the current beta build. ( Samsung ) Advertisement Samsung has recently allowed Galaxy S7 and S7 edge owners enrolled in its beta program to try out Android 7.0 Nougat before the official build rolls out, likely for users to pry the software for potential bugs, issues and the ilk. Once the beta trial concludes, the official Nougat build will then hit Galaxy S7 and S7 edge devices before 2016 ends. Unfortunately, the same can't be said for Galaxy S7 and S7 edge models under Verizon. Big Red has now confirmed that the two smartphones will receive Nougat later, in early 2017. Verizon Galaxy S7 And S7 Edge Nougat Update Delayed The news was announced via the Galaxy Beta app: \"Dear Customers, Verizon will stay on the original software for the remainder of this trial,\" the announcement reads. Beta trial users will then be upgraded to the official Nougat build rolling out next year. The announcement ultimately translates to Verizon no longer endorsing the Beta Program on the aforementioned handsets. Unfortunately, Verizon customers won't be eligible for future beta releases of Nougat for the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge moving forward, Android Authority explains . For beta testers under Verizon, the course of action is either to leave the program and revert to Android 6.0 Marshmallow or simply remain in the current beta version of Nougat, according to SamMobile. \nParticipants who choose to remain seated in the phone's beta trial will get Nougat, Samsung said. Samsung And Verizon's Strained Relationship The reason behind Verizon's delay is unknown, but unsurprising. Samsung and Verizon haven't exactly seen eye to eye numerous times in the past. \nTake the Galaxy S5 for instance, where Verizon customers were denied the Download Booster feature until an update added it back. Download Booster allowed the Galaxy devices to download files more than 30 MB in size faster through Wi-Fi and mobile data connection at the same time. \nOn the Galaxy Note 5, the Write on PDF feature initially wasn't made available. Finally, with the now-canceled Galaxy Note 7, the Samsung Cloud Storage feature was hidden and users needed to use an app shortcut to have it located within the software. Owners of non-Verizon Galaxy S7 and S7 edge handsets need not worry about their planned Nougat update as long as they have an active Samsung account and have the Galaxy Beta Program app installed on their phone. \nVerizon Galaxy S7 and S7 edge owners, have you received the notification yet? Will you wait it out for Nougat or opt to downgrade to Marshmallow? Feel free to sound off in the comments section below!  ",

      "text": "verizon free calls texts indonesia wireless logo store front More Digital Trends / Robert Nazarian\nVerizon is playing its part in helping the aid effort following the massive Indonesia earthquake — the company is allowing customers to connect with friends and family in Indonesia for free.\nThe earthquake struck Indonesia’s Aceh province just before dawn on Wednesday, lasting around 15 seconds and causing the deaths of nearly 100 people and the collapse of about 100 buildings in the area. That includes 72 combined shops and dwellings, 15 homes, a gas station, a school, and five mosques. Rescue efforts are hampered by the fact that the local hospital was also damaged in the quake.\nMore: In hot pursuit of Verizon, AT&T begins testing 5G technology in Austin, Texas\n“More than 160,000 Verizon employees worldwide want to support our friends and family in Indonesia who have been impacted by the massive 6.4 earthquake,” said Verizon in a statement. “Verizon is offering free wireless and wireline calling from the U.S. to Indonesia to connect with family and friends.”\nAccording to Verizon, home wireless phone customers will not incur any charges for calls to Indonesia from their landline from December 7-9. Mobile wireless customers won’t incur charges for calls and texts from the U.S. to Indonesia on the same dates.\nVerizon’s announcement highlights the fact that tech companies are playing a bigger and bigger role in helping people connect following a disaster. Facebook in particular has been making an effort to switch on its Safety Check feature, which essentially lets users mark that they’re safe after a disaster takes place, letting all their friends know that they don’t need to worry about them. Facebook has turned the feature on a number of times, including during the Oakland fire that killed 36 people on December 2 and during a recent Ohio State University attack that left seven injured.\nSamsung’s Galaxy Note 7 debacle is far from over Airbnb is helping Hurricane Matthew evacuees with free housing Verizon offers free calls to Haiti in ‘chaotic’ aftermath of Hurricane Matthew",
