Henson, on the other hand, opted for a low ponytail - but it still had plenty of drama. The actress paired her Celine shirt dress with a bum-grazing pony and striking purple lip.",

      "text": "How to Link to and Embed Excel Files in Word Documents Microsoft Word & Excel. By James Marshall Updated February 12, 2016 . \nIf you’re using Word to create business documents such as reports and business plans, it is inevitable that you will need to include data created in Excel . You have two options available for this: You can either link to an Excel document to pull the data you want into your Word file, or you can embed the Excel document itself within Word file itself. While these are easy processes, you have to be aware of your options and the limitations inherent in each.In this article, I will cover both how to link to and embed an Excel document in your Word document. Linking to an Excel Spreadsheet \nFor users who want to ensure that the information is updated every time a change is made to the spreadsheet, linking is the way to go. A one-way link is created that feeds the data from your Excel file into the Word document. Linking an Excel document will also keep your Word file small, as the data itself is not saved with the Word document. \nLinking to an Excel document does have some limitations: \ncontinue reading below our video How Does 3D Printing Work? If you move the Excel file, you will need to re-establish the link in the Word document. If you plan to transport the Word file or use it on another computer, you must to remember to transport the Excel file along with it. You must do all your data editing in the Excel document. This generally is not a problem unless you require different formats in the Word document. \nNote: If you're using Word 2007 , you'll want to read the article on how to link to Excel data in Word 2007 . \nIf you are using an earlier version of Word, follow these simple steps: Open both the Word document and the Excel spreadsheet you will be linking to. In Excel, select and copy the range of cells you want to include (if you plan to insert more columns or rows into your spreadsheet, select the entire worksheet by clicking the box located in the upper left corner at the juncture of the row numbers and column letters). In your Word document position the cursor where you want the linked table inserted. On the Edit menu, select Paste Special… Click the radio button beside Paste link . Under the label As: , select Microsoft Excel Worksheet Object . Click OK . \nYour Excel data should now be inserted into and linked to your Excel spreadsheet. If you make changes to the source Excel file, the next time you open your Word document you will be prompted to update the linked data. Embedding an Excel Spreadsheet \nThe process of embedding an Excel worksheet in your Word document is essentially the same as linking to an Excel worksheet. The only difference is in the options you specify in the Paste Special dialog box. While the results might appear the same at first, they are dramatically different. \nBe aware that when embedding an Excel document within a Word document, the entire Excel document will be included. Word formats the embedded data to display what you selected, but the entire Excel document will be included in the Word file. \nEmbedding an Excel document will make your Word document's file size larger. \nIf you're using Word 2007, learn how to embed Excel data in Word 2007 . For earlier versions of Word, follow these simple steps to embed an Excel file in your Word document: Open both the Word document and the Excel spreadsheet. In Excel, copy the range of cells you want to include. In your Word document position the cursor where you would like the table inserted.

      "title": "Microsoft Edge on Android and iOS?",
      "text": "Microsoft Edge is a web browser that is exclusively available for Microsoft's new operating system Windows 10. In fact, Edge is the default system browser on the system. While Internet Explorer is still there as well, Edge is promoted left and right while Internet Explorer is kept on mostly for legacy reasons.\nMicrosoft made it clear back in 2015, when it started to promote Windows 10 more actively, that it had no plans to bring Microsoft Edge to previous versions of Windows or mobile platforms such as Android or iOS.\nThe company did not say never back then, but that it wanted to put the focus on delivering the best experience on Windows 10 before exploring any other options.\nIt appears that Microsoft is now at a stage where it is exploring those options. A recent tweet by Fahad Al-Riyami, technology strategist at Microsoft, asks users on Twitter whether they would like to see Microsoft Edge ported to Android and iOS.\n\nThe current standing, 30 minutes before polls close, is that 85% of all voters want to see Edge ported. The number of voters is relatively small however.\nFahad links to an August 2015 post on Microsoft's Community forum in which the thread starter -- not a Microsoft employee -- asked other users of the forum to tell Microsoft if they wanted to see Edge brought to Android and iOS.\nWhile there is little keeping Edge from being ported to Android, the situation looks different in Apple's ecosystem as it does not allow third-party browsers. While you can create a browser for iOS, they all share Safari's Webkit rendering engine. This would mean that Edge would be a different product on iOS than it would be on Android or Windows 10.\nAll of this is just exploration for now. Microsoft made no mention of porting Edge to any other operating system, be it mobile or desktop.\nNeglecting core Windows customers I think it is rather interesting that Microsoft seems to have no intention to bring Edge to previous versions of Windows.\nConsidering that a large part of Microsoft's customer base is still on Windows Vista, 7 and 8, it is not the customer-friendliest of ideas.\nMicrosoft continues its neglect of -- still supported -- previous versions of the Windows operating system. While there is a good chance that those same customers may run Android or iOS, it is questionable if many would want to install Edge.\nEven if you take all the animosities out of the picture, you'd end up with a mobile-only browser since Edge cannot be installed on pre-Windows 10 devices.\nThis would mean no syncing of data between mobile and desktop versions of the browser.\nIt would come down mostly to how good Edge is on those mobile devices however. While it is certainly a big improvement over Internet Explorer on the desktop, Edge lacks features currently and the same would probably be true for the mobile version of the browser.\nAnother issue that Microsoft will face if it ports Edge to Android or iOS is that it won't have an operating system at hand to push Edge to users.\nNow You : Would you like to see Microsoft Edge on Android or iOS?\nGhacks needs you. You can find out how to support us here or support the site directly by becoming a Patreon . Thank you for being a Ghacks reader.\nThe post Microsoft Edge on Android and iOS? appeared first on gHacks Technology News .\n",

      "text": "Subscribe on YouTube\nGive Microsoft credit for not giving up. Even though Google’s Chrome has a massive share of the browser market ( 2 billion installs served , as McDonalds used to say), the Redmond campus continues to press forward with its Edge browser. Being the kindly tech big brother that it is, Microsoft would just like to let you know that in its opinion, Edge is a “safer” browser than Chrome or Firefox. Yes, Opera browser fans, we acknowledge your passion, but at least Microsoft didn’t single you out.\nNeowin reminds us of those past pesky Windows 10 notifications that used to remind you Chrome was draining your battery faster than Edge . They’re back, and this time Microsoft is touting its Internet Explorer successor as a “safer” alternative. In the past, Windows Tips were used as an instructional means to educate users about the OS. However, with notifications such as these, it’s easy to see that the educational aspect has been blurred, and it is now little more than a commercial for their nascent software.\nmicrosoft-edge-5 More VentureBeat says this new “tip” has just rolled out this month, and appears just above the Edge taskbar icon. In case you didn’t know this — it points out that the browser blocks “21 percent more socially engineered malware.” You can turn off this notification, too. Go to Settings > System > Notifications > Disable “Get tips, tricks and suggestions as you use Windows.”\nMore: Windows 10 Anniversary Edition aims to knock down ransomware\nObviously, it is in Microsoft’s best interests to promote its browser, and its latest OS is one prime piece of tech real estate for such a task. However, given the enormous and seemingly insurmountable lead that Chrome has, and with others like Firefox, Opera, Safari, and even work-in-progress effort Vivaldi out there, is Microsoft just howling at the moon here?\nFor a little nostalgia, look at the IE market share from 4 years ago . Hmmm, if you look at that pie chart and put Chrome where IE shows, it would pretty much reflect present day, yet we now know where IE has ended up. Maybe Chrome’s lead isn’t so impervious?\nGoogle’s Chrome browser is on 2 billion devices, a staggering number Tired of Chrome eating up your RAM? Google finally plans to fix it Microsoft continues the browser battery life battle in yet another video",

      "text": "\nRumor has it that Apple is working on augmented reality glasses that may debut in 2018.\nBy then Microsoft's high-profile, untethered, AR wearable computer, HoloLens , will be three years old. Microsoft's earlier arrival to the market, however, is no guarantee that Redmond's answer to AR will win over Cupertino's much later arrival .\nMicrosoft was first to tablets and smartphones after all, and we know how that turned out. Still, Redmond seems to have learned a lesson or two from its former lax approach to hardware that resulted in the company being beaten at its own game on more than one occasion.\nMicrosoft beating Apple to AR doesn't guarantee a win.\nWith HoloLens Microsoft has taken a strategically calculated approach to the market by introducing it to specific industries and for specific use cases . This tailored approach has garnered passionate developer support for Windows Holographic. Moreover, Microsoft's nurturing of partner relationships to bring HoloLens-like hardware to market will further help Microsoft's ecosystem become the industry's platform for mix-reality (the continuum from augmented to virtual reality ).\n",

      "title": "Xbox Head Would Love to See Mario on Microsoft Console",
      "text": "Xbox head Phil Spencer claims that he’d love to see games like Super Mario arrive on a Microsoft console, admitting that ‘Nintendo has the strongest first-party of anybody.’ Given the prominence of Nintendo and its wide array of beloved properties, it should come as no surprise that any outside hardware manufacturer would kill to have the firm’s iconic IP arrive on its platform. While that seemed like a farfetched dream at one point, Nintendo’s properties have begun leaving their own consoles in favor of tapping into a larger audience on mobile devices. Evidently, this recent initiative by the Big N was the catalyst for a question during an interview with Xbox head Phil Spencer – namely, whether or not Microsoft saw Nintendo creating games for its hardware as a legitimate possibility in the future.\nAusGamer was the site responsible for the question, and apparently Spencer was more than happy to clarify, rather unsurprisingly, that “I’d love to see Mario on Xbox.” Citing a recent partnership between Microsoft and Nintendo which has seen Minecraft arrive on Wii U, Spencer reiterated his personal fondness for the company and indicated a strong desire to work together again in the future.\n“As someone who’s been in this industry and played games forever, I’ll still say it: Nintendo has the strongest first-party of anybody. They’re just fantastic and the memories that they have instilled in so many of us, who’ve played their games and had those delightful experiences, having those on Xbox would be great. Obviously we have Minecraft on Nintendo and when that opportunity came up to work with them on Minecraft, you know, some people might look at it and say ‘why would you even do that?’, but with Nintendo, it’s been a great partnership on Minecraft.”\n“In fact they put Mario in Minecraft on Wii U with the mash-up skin pack. And continuing to work with them on that and building a stronger relationship… I mean if that paid dividends down the road that lead to something else, that would be fantastic. I know I get questions all the time on would I ever like to see Banjo in Super Smash Bros. and I’m, like, “yes, I would do that in a second”. And certain people think I’m saying that as some sort of PR answer and I’m, like, why wouldn’t you?”\n\nSpencer’s willingness to grant Nintendo access to Banjo for use in Super Smash Bros. has been a prominent topic of discussion for the Xbox head (and Smash fans) in the past. As one of the more requested characters for the fighting franchise, especially given his roots to the Japanese publisher, this desire will likely remain steadfast for as long as the series exists. Still, with Mario content featured prominently in Minecraft for Wii U , it’s nice to see that Nintendo is keen to partner with Microsoft if and when it makes sense to.\nIn closing, Spencer clarified his desire to grow Microsoft’s relationship with the house of Mario in the years to come.\n“Anyway, I’m a big Nintendo fan and I think they’ve been incredibly important for the games industry, they do a great job with younger audiences, and if we ever had a chance to work with them in the future, I would absolutely do it.”\nIt’ll be interesting to see if anything more than a Minecraft crossover restricted to Nintendo hardware comes from this partnership in time. With Nintendo preparing to launch its Switch console this March , however, it’s unlikely that Mario and friends will be making their way to a Microsoft console at any point in the immediate future. With that said, perhaps smaller, joint initiatives here and there could benefit both brands – namely, introducing Steve to Super Smash Bros. or adding Battletoads to a hypothetical NES Classic Edition 2 .\nSource: AusGamer ",

      "text": "Reddit \nMove over tele-commuting. Microsoft’s Holoportation will be the remote office of the future. The somewhat distant future. Microsoft has just published an update to its Holoportation idea that is making Star Wars like holographic communication a reality. And while the technology has already been proven to work, it’s far from being something you can really use anytime anywhere. In this latest iteration, however, Microsoft takes one step closer to that ideal, by allowing Holoportation to fit and be used inside a moving car. \nIn a nutshell, Microsoft’s Holoportation is a combination of its holographic and mixed reality technologies that records a person in another location and “projects” a full 3D representation in real-time and in another location. However, it isn’t exactly projecting into thin air like a real hologram. Instead, you view the 3D image through a headset like the Microsoft HoloLens or even an HTC Vive. \nThe technology was first revealed back in March this year before Microsoft’s 2016 BUILD conference. This time, however, Microsoft Research makes a significant step forward by reducing both the physical footprint as well as the needed bandwidth to make Holoportation work. To put it simply, they’re able to place the whole machine inside a car and require “only” 30 to 50 Mbps of bandwidth, which is still a lot. In practice, this makes it possible to use Holoportation inside a moving vehicle, as long as there’s a strong and good Wi-Fi connection. \nHoloportation aims to make remote communication more personal by providing an actual, 3D, and real-time representation of the people you’re talking with (say goodbye to video conferencing in your PJs). There’s still a lot of work to be done, however. The in-vehicle implementation uses only two cameras, which results in lower image quality. More cameras mean higher resolutions but also requires more space. The bandwidth requirement is still pretty big, despite the 97% reduction from the first prototype. This would mean that cellular data is still out of the question. \nAnd in case you’re wondering, the current setup requires the user to be at the back seat. Which is well and good, because you won’t want to be Holoporting while driving anyway.",

Microsoft Holoportation Turns Star Wars Esque Communication Into A Reality Telepresence could be the next step in video calls. Follow @MiserlyGeek Share this \nWith some clever use of 3D capture, software wizardry, and Hololens, Microsoft has come a step closer to digital presence technology shown in science fiction movies such as Star Wars. In a recent update, the Software-giant has significantly cut the setup requirements.As opposed to the early studio room experiment, Microsoft's engineers have managed to fit the entire rig in a car. Of course, it is meant to be used by the person sitting in a passenger seat. Nobody wants to divert a driver's attention right? According to the FAQs posted on the company's blog , the system requires only two cameras. One to capture the video and other to add depth information to it. To achieve better quality, you can increase the number of cameras. In addition to fitting the entire system in a car, the company had to deal with ever changing lighting and vibration.To experience the holographic tele-presence, you will have to wear headsets such as Hololens or HTC Vive. Excited already? Don't forget to check out the demonstration video below:",

      "text": "Microsoft calls for Increased Cyber Security Awareness ….and strong Anti-Piracy Laws By Ghanaian Chronicle \nMicrosoft has this week proven that it is once again a Champion of Cyber Security Awareness joining a growing effort by the government and other agencies to promote Cyber safety and anti-piracy awareness in Ghana. \nStarting Monday 21st November 2016 through to Friday 25th November 2016, Microsoft in collaboration with the National Communication Authority, Ministry of Communication, and National Security Secretariat with the support from the US Government is hosting a week-long awareness drive on Cyber Security. \n“Technology is evolving and so is the increased need for security especially around information sharing. What was once a semi-isolated affair and it has become a multi-agency, cross-continent operation, with governments and rights holders alike striving to share information and pool resources.” Said Derek Appiah, Country Manager, Microsoft Ghana. \nThe Cyber Security Awareness week kicks off with highly informative and thought provoking discussions presenting opportunities for companies with cutting edge solutions to cyber security and available solutions to businesses and organizations. \nThe week will grace high caliber speakers, sharing their perspectives and experiences in solving the mounting security threat facing government and businesses today. \nThe interactive Cyber Security Awareness program will also provide keen insights into the challenges that businesses face in protecting critical data from continual threats of attacks. \nAlso, during the same week, Microsoft has partnered with the Ghana Copyright office to announce their collaboration in the fight against counterfeit software which has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. \n“We have partnered with the Government of Ghana and the Ghana Copyright office to create awareness, to promote and protect the rights of both users and fabricators of technology solutions” added Appiah. \nOur networks are getting smarter so are the threats, it's more important than ever to work with Governments to strengthen intellectual property laws and crack down on piracy. \nThe impact of pirated and counterfeit software has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. \nAs a company, we make Cyber security which broadly includes anti-piracy, our day to day business and as an industry leader we shall continue to forge partnerships to counter these threats to our consumers.",

      "text": "\nFor Black Friday 2016, deal quality shifts as you cross the console divide. As always, Microsoft comes in guns a-blazing with aggressive deals and prices on the Xbox One S. Over in the Sony camp, PlayStation 4 Slim deals are available - but they aren't jaw-droppingly good, at least compared to those on the Xbox One S.\nThus far, the best option for the Xbox One S will be at the Microsoft Store. At the official retailer, you can pick up select Xbox One S bundles with a free game of your choice plus a bonus $25 gift card as an extra incentive. Not a bad deal at all, especially given all Xbox One S consoles are discounted by $50 this week.\nThings are a bit timid so far on the PS4 side, but we're spotting three deals: a very nice PS4 Slim Uncharted 4 bundle for only $239.99, a PS4 Pro 1TB deal for $269.99, and finally, a PS4 Pro deal for $375 at NewEgg (if you have an American Express credit card), bundled with Deus Ex: Mankind Divided and a Plantronics P80 headset (a $60 value).\nUnlike years past, retailers aren't leaking their very best non-public deals, so check back Thursday night or Friday morning to see if more goodies are added. We suspect a few retailers will hold a few surprises yet.\nXbox One S Black Friday Deals \nXbox One S 500GB Battlefield 1 + Free Game + $25 Gift  — $249.99   (list price $300) Xbox One S 500GB Minecraft + Free Game +$25 Gift Code  — $249.99   (list price $300) Xbox One S 1TB Battlefield 1 + Free Game+ $25 Gift Code  — $299.99   (list price $350) Xbox One S 2TB Gears of War + Free Game + $25 Gift Code  — $399.99   (list price $450) Xbox One Controllers \nXbox One S White Wireless Controller  — $39.99   (list price $60) Xbox One Wireless Controller, Play & Charge Kit  — $39.99   (list price $75) PlayStation 4 Black Friday Deals \nPlayStation 4 Slim 500GB Uncharted 4 Bundle  — $239.99   (list price $300) PlayStation 4 Pro 1TB Console — $369.99   <- add to cart to see deal PlayStation 4 Pro 1TB Console + Mankind Divided + Plantronics P80 Headset — $399.99  <- use Amex credit card and get $25 off ",

Microsoft Holoportation Turns Star Wars Esque Communication Into A Reality Telepresence could be the next step in video calls. Follow @MiserlyGeek Share this \nWith some clever use of 3D capture, software wizardry, and Hololens, Microsoft has come a step closer to digital presence technology shown in science fiction movies such as Star Wars. In a recent update, the Software-giant has significantly cut the setup requirements.As opposed to the early studio room experiment, Microsoft's engineers have managed to fit the entire rig in a car. Of course, it is meant to be used by the person sitting in a passenger seat. Nobody wants to divert a driver's attention right? According to the FAQs posted on the company's blog , the system requires only two cameras. One to capture the video and other to add depth information to it. To achieve better quality, you can increase the number of cameras. In addition to fitting the entire system in a car, the company had to deal with ever changing lighting and vibration.To experience the holographic tele-presence, you will have to wear headsets such as Hololens or HTC Vive. Excited already? Don't forget to check out the demonstration video below:",

      "text": "Minimum PC Requirements For Windows Holographic Revealed \n“We don’t want to be driven by just envy of what others have, the question is what can we bring? That’s where I look at any device form factor or any technology, even AI,” Nadella was quoted as saying. “We will continue to be in the phone market not as defined by today’s market leaders, but by what it is that we can uniquely do in what is the most ultimate mobile device.” \nAccording to MacRumors , Nadella’s statement simply means that Microsoft wants to redefine the field by making the “ultimate mobile device” — what is currently being rumored as the Surface Phone. In ensuring that this device would shine on its own in the sea of competition, the Redmond giant is interested in knowing how individuals and organizations use their phones, instead of studying the market trend at present. \nRecent reports have been claiming that Microsoft is working on a Surface Phone with “laptop-class” Intel processors. There are also speculations that Microsoft could be secretly working on a device based on the HP Elite x3’s build, which is a part smartphone, part mini PC device. At this point, it is still to early to tell, but GSM Arena is taking Nadella's statement as a clear sign that Microsoft Surface Phone is already being developed.

      "text": "Report: Microsoft Surface Phone Prototype Runs Snapdragon 835, Supports x86 Apps GO New report claims work on the Surface Phone advances Nov 25, 2016 07:51 GMT · By Bogdan Popa · Share: Everyone in the Windows Phone community hopes to see Microsoft launching the eagerly-anticipated Surface Phone next year, and according to a recent report, work on the project advances nicely and the company is indeed on track to unveil the device with Redstone 3 in the fall of 2017 Before anything, a small disclaimer: this is just a report for the time being and is based on unknown sources, so there’s a good chance that it’s not accurate. But given the latest rumors, the details that the report includes pretty much make sense. Specifically, NPU writes that Microsoft has developed several prototypes for the Surface Phone and all of them are powered by a Snapdragon 835 CPU and come with support for Quick Charge 4.0. This would give the device super-fast charging speeds with a USB Type-C connector. Wireless charging is very likely to be supported as well. x86 app support The source claims that the prototypes are powered by Windows 10 Mobile 64-bit and one of the most powerful comes with 6 GB of RAM, allowing it to run x86 apps in Continuum mode. This aligns with previous rumors that Microsoft might be working on some sort of emulation that would be possible on ARM64 , so the software giant might be testing this with a prototype. For the moment, x86 apps are exclusive to Continuum for this early prototype of the Surface Phone, but users can install them even when not connected to an external screen. There’s also another Surface Phone version with 4 GB of RAM, but this one doesn’t support x86 apps at all, not even in Continuum mode. This could be a more affordable version of the phone for consumers, but without x86 support, it would be very similar to the existing Windows phones. The Surface Phone is likely to come with a 5.5-inch screen and feature a laptop accessory that would thus provide a new form factor to the device. This accessory might only work with the top-of-the-range version aimed at businesses, and not with the 4GB model. The debut of the phone could take place in late 2017 when Microsoft could also take the wraps off Windows 10 Redstone 3, but neither the Surface Phone nor the OS update was confirmed by the software giant.",

      "text": "\nBack in August, Microsoft released the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with support for extensions on Microsoft Edge. At the initial launch, there were a few extensions available for Microsoft Edge . And over the coming months, Microsoft has been teaming up with companies to bring their extensions to the Edge browser. Earlier this week, Microsoft quietly announced that the company is working closely with 1Password to bring its extension to Microsoft Edge. The extension will initially be available for Windows Insiders which is pretty unfortunate, but that’s because Edge is missing some required APIs at the moment. With a future build of Windows 10 Insider Preview, Microsoft will add the APIs required by 1Password to Edge which is when the extension should also be available:\nWe're happy to announce we're working closely with 1Password to release a preview extension to Insiders – lighting up the required APIs soon\n— Microsoft Edge Dev (@MSEdgeDev) November 21, 2016 \n\nHowever, this could mean that it might take a little while for the 1Password extension to be available for all Windows 10 Anniversary Update users. Microsoft Edge still lacks quite a lot of APIs for extensions, which is likely why the company is yet to open up submissions of Edge extensions on the Windows Store to all developers. As you may now, Microsoft doesn’t allow independent developers to submit Edge extensions on the Windows Store yet which is why the browser only has a few extensions at the moment. This will hopefully change as Microsoft continues to add new APIs to Edge — but as for now, you can only use the extensions available from Microsoft’s partners.",

      "text": "[caption id=\"attachment_24047\" align=\"alignright\" width=\"1024\"] image: Microsoft[/caption]It's that time again. America's busiest shopping day is upon us, and with it comes an excellent opportunity to pick up a new console. The Xbox One may have gone through a bit of a rough patch, but it’s back in full force with backwards compatibility, the slimmed down “S” model, and a couple of years worth of excellent games. If you’ve waited this long, you could do worse than picking up an Xbox One S this Black Friday.As a rule, expect $50 off Xbox One bundles in their various forms. This puts standard 500 gb Xbox One S bundles at $249.99, and other SKUs priced accordingly. Dell has one of the best deals out there today: the 500 gb Battlefield 1 bundle with Gears of War 4 and an extra controller $249.99. If you’re a fan of shooters, both of those are worth having. The Microsoft Store has flexible bundles overall, with $50 off select bundles plus a select game and a $25 code. Shopko has the 500 gb Battlefield 1 bundle for $299 with $100 in electronics coupons. Target is offering 500 gb Battlefield 1 and Minecraft bundles for $249.99 plus a $40 gift card. Gamestop has got a pretty slick-looking Blue 500 gb Xbox One S Bundle for $249.99, or a 1tb Gears of War 4 bundle for $299.Game wise, deals are all over the place. But some of the best you’ll find are at Best Buy, which has a wide range of new and slightly older games at deep discounts. A good rule of thumb for buying software during Black Friday is to skip anything that came out in the past three months or so: nobody discounts those much. Head back a year, however, and you can find truly excellent games for $20 and under. Even some of the biggest hits from 2016 summer and winter are finding themselves down 50% or more. I’d recommend Overwatch at $35.Most other major retailers online and off will have $50 off most bundles, so that’s what we’re working with here.",

      "text": "Did You Order A Microsoft Surface Studio? Some Lucky Users Will Get Them This Week 25 November 2016, 8:59 am EST By Anu Passary Tech Times If you were among the initial few who preordered the Surface Studio desktop from Microsoft on the first day, you will receive the device this week. Microsoft is now shipping these orders earlier than the given time window. ( Microsoft Store ) Advertisement \nIf you were among the initial few who preordered the new Surface Studio PC from Microsoft, then you will be pleased as punch to learn that the Redmond-based company is already shipping out the device. \nOn Wednesday, Nov. 23, Microsoft started shipping out the ultrathin Surface Studio to those who had preordered the PC on the first day of availability itself. \nIf you are one of the lucky users quick to jump the gun and preorder the device, then check your email and you would possibly have a shipping notification from Microsoft waiting in your inbox. \nMicrosoft was initially expected to ship the Surface Studios in mid-December. However, per reports, the company has emailed the first people who preordered the $2,999 PC, alerting them of the Surface Studio's shipment and arrival this week. \n\"The wait is almost over! Your Surface Studio is about to arrive. Our team has worked relentlessly to reinvent your desktop, and we want your first experience with the Surface Studio to be absolutely perfect,\" reads the email from Panos Panay, the corporate vice president of Devices at Microsoft. \nIn addition to shipping the desktop, Microsoft will be offering the Surface Studio customers a dedicated phone line they can call to get help with any problems they could potentially encounter with the new PC. They can express their concerns or give feedback as well. \nConsidering that the early adopters of the Surface Studio are shelling out a minimum of $3,000, the high-end customer service Microsoft is offering its consumers will be appreciated by them. \nThat's not all - Microsoft will also ship a tiny booklet along with the Surface Studio as a token of appreciation for customers who purchased the $2,999 device. Surface Studio Specs And Features \nFor the uninitiated, the Surface Studio has a 28-inch (across) touchscreen display, which is just 12.5 millimeters (0.49 inches) thick. Microsoft asserts this is the \"world's thinnest LCD monitor.\" \nThe new PC has a 3:2 display ratio and employs TrueColor tech. It has 13.5 million pixels to offer an immersive experience to users - it doesn't matter which angle the screen is viewed from. \nUnder the hood, the Surface Studio houses a quad-core i7 processor , 2 TB hard drive, an Nvidia 980M GPU and 32 GB of RAM. The device also has slots for an SD card, four USB 3.0 ports, audio, Mini DisplayPort, as well as Ethernet and audio cables. \nMicrosoft continues to accept preorders for the Surface Studio, but the new devices will not ship before \"early 2017.\" TAG © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft has made several adjustments to its design language over the last few years, starting with Windows 8 and evolving into what we now know as \"Microsoft Design Language 2\" or MDL2 in Windows 10 . With MDL2 being the current design language used throughout Windows 10, Microsoft has plans to begin using a much more streamlined design language with Redstone 3, codenamed Project NEON.\nA Metro 2.0? Cassim Ketfi at Numerama.com confirms our information and has heard Project NEON called \"basically Metro 2\". That designation refers to the first Metro design language (née Modern) that harkens to Windows Media Center up through Windows Phone 7 and Windows 8.\nMicrosoft's Metro was a strict codified theory about modern design language\nMetro was the defining look of the Windows Phone OS with strict principles and guidelines. It also kicked off the design movement of flat, chrome-less design focused on simplicity that even iOS and Android now mimic.\nPer our sources, Project NEON has been in the works for over a year internally at Microsoft. It builds upon the design language introduced with Windows 10, with its simple and clean interfaces, but adds some much-needed flair to the UI that the current design language just lacks.\n",

      "text": "Sign up for our weekly news updates by entering your email: Advertisement Super Mario On Xbox One? Microsoft Partners With Nintendo! According to Microsoft, it has been very a good partnership. Mario will be able to be played on Xbox now! By Maisum Raza , EnStars on Nov 25, 2016 12:21 PM EST Tag : mario , super mario , xbox , nintendo , microsoft Sign Up for Newsletter The logo of Japanese gaming giant Nintendo and its game character Super Mario are displayed at a show room in Tokyo on September 8, 2016. Tokyo stocks slipped on the morning of September 8, as soft Japanese growth data left investors guessing about the chances of more central bank stimulus, but Nintendo soared on news of a Super Mario game tie-up with Apple. / AFP / KAZUHIRO NOGI (Photo credit should read KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images) (Photo : KAZUHIRO NOGI/AFP/Getty Images) Advertisement \nMicrosoft planned and reached out to Nintendo because they wanted to bring Super Mario to their very own Xbox One. According to Phil Spencer himself, he admits that Nintendo has perhaps the strongest first-party genre of games out of every organization. \nThis is why he really wants to see them on the Xbox One. This is quite the interesting catch as it is always nice to see usual competitors partner up and bring lovable characters across various consoles. Seeing Mario on an Xbox console is something many probably thought of but never really accepted it as reality. \nWell, now it is! \nExpress quoted other things Spencer mentioned. It stated that even Spencer believes the games given to the world by Nintendo have had a special place in the hearts of anyone who knows anything about video games. \nHe is not wrong! Nintendo is one of the earliest game producing companies in the history of video games and so, they took the cozy first spot. No one can take them off that. Spencer was clear about his intentions and he really wants to see these famous characters on his Microsoft's Xbox One. \nThis partnership was also a good idea because Nintendo and Microsoft already have a strong bond since Minecraft is playable on Nintendo. Now, it is time to make the relationship even stronger! \nGamespot mentioned that this could very well be related to how the Wii U has a Mario Brother-themed DLC coming into their version of Minecraft. Recent news mentioned how it is doing very well so, perhaps this caused a bit of harmless envy in Microsoft. \nNews of this is completely confirmed and the chances of this not happening are slim to none. Therefore, one can expect a Super Mario integration on the Xbox One. It will certainly be a sight to remember.  ",

      "text": "\nCortana , Microsoft’s entry in the crowded digital assistant market, has a new update on Android devices. Among other things, it now adds birthday reminders for the first time.\nSee also: How to use Cortana for Android January 21, 2016 The new feature basically lets Cortana access a user’s Outlook Calendar and then offers up reminders if it spots an upcoming birthday. The new 1.9.12 version also lets the app connect to multiple different calendars. Finally, the app has some improvements for its location-based reminders and its meeting retrieval features, along with some unnamed bug fixes.\nIn related news, the bezel-less Xiaomi Mi Mix smartphone for Android now includes the Cortana app pre-installed for people who buy the device in China. At the moment, it appears the Mi Mix will be the only such phone from Xiaomi to have that honor and it may not be made available outside that country. The device will also have Microsoft’s family of Office apps pre-installed, along with Outlook Email. Microsoft previously announced a partnership with Cyanogen to offer deep integration with Cortana into the Cyanogen OS version of Android, and that was indeed added with the release of build version 12.1.\nGet it at Google Play ",

It's known as Local Publishing . \nThe WSUS API allows you to create and publish custom updates, applications, and device drivers for your organization. The process of authoring and distributing this kind of update is called local publishing. Local publishing is best performed by organizations that have dedicated development and testing resources, since the planning, implementation, testing, and deployment of custom updates is a complex and time-consuming process. \nCheck out http://localupdatepubl.sourceforge.net/ : \nLocal Update Publisher allows system administrators to publish their own updates to Windows Server Update Services using local publishing. \nCheck out http://wsuspackagepublisher.codeplex.com/ : \nWsus Package Publisher allows you to publish your own updates as MSI, MSP or EXE files.

      "text": "print Michael Seto/Business Insider \nMotorola used to be one of those giant corporate conglomerates that employed 150,000 people, many at a massive campus in Schaumburg, Illinois. But it hit hard times, and over the last several years it sold off chunks of itself and became Motorola Solutions. \nMotorola Solutions is still a huge company. It employs around 14,000 and generated $5.8 billion in revenue over the last four quarters. But it has sold the huge campus and moved to new headquarters in Chicago. \nAs part of its move and cost cutting, Motorola is unplugging its data centers and going all-in in the cloud. \nIts cloud of choice is Amazon Web Services, Leo Wang, head of cloud computing, told Business Insider. \n\"When we first we started, we were moving just one data center, our Schaumburg data center,\" he said. \"Within 6 to 7 months, we moved more than 200,000 servers, and 150 applications, and we had more than $2 million in computer yearly spend moved over to AWS.\" \nAnd they liked AWS so much, they decided to move everything else into it, worldwide, over the course of the next two years, Wang said. \n\"We save millions per year. We invested millions initially but the long range savings will be significant, and we have a more aggressive plan next year and the year after.\" \nChoosing Amazon wasn't automatic. In fact, Motorola already had a smaller contract with Microsoft to use its competing cloud, Azure. But Microsoft wasn't able to turn that into a bigger sale. Why Microsoft didn't win \nMicrosoft CEO Satya Nadella Business Insider \nMotorola Solutions sells radios and communications equipment to government agencies like police, fire, other emergency services. \nThey chose Azure because Azure had a crucial government security certification known as Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) and Amazon didn't. \nSo when Motorola opted to move everything to the cloud, the IT folks looked at Amazon, Microsoft, and Google. \n\"Amazon had better technologies in almost all areas. It is much more mature in terms of functionality. They excelled in every aspect that we needed from the cloud perspective and from the customer service perspective, but they didn’t have the CIJS compliance,\" Wang said. \nBut CIJS certification was a deal breaker, they told Amazon. \n\"Initially, they were hesitating. They were not interested in having this certification because they were so big in the market,\" Wang says. \nBut they agreed to look into it and decided to get CIJS, realizing it could open up new government markets for its cloud. Amazon is already making a name for itself pursuing government cloud business with its \"GovCloud,\" a highly secured section of the AWS's services reserved for government use. \n\"Once they realized the importance of this certification in this industry, they invested. In a few months they were certified, and they created a Gov Cloud for us,\" Wang said. \nMotorola Solutions head of cloud computing Leo Wang Leo Wang \nBy doing this, Motorola was able to launch a brand new app for its law enforcement customers on AWS that lets them store camera footage on AWS. This app has the potential to be huge for Motorola and AWS, Wang believes. \nAmazon isn't known for its customer service, but Wang can't sing AWS's support praises any louder. \n\"Andy Jassy personally came to our office and had a detailed look at what we had. They put a lot of attention to us,\" Wang said. \nIn comparing AWS's support to that from Microsoft, he called it \"very different,\" saying, \"With AWS we are very tightly engaged with them in almost all efforts. We have meetings, we share our concerns, we have follow up, and a consultant works closely with us, and works closely with the product team.\" Amazon's big gotcha \nThere is one big downside to choosing Amazon: it's harder to keep track of costs. \nLike all cloud providers Amazon charges for the actual time each machine (known as an instance) is used. That's a benefit over buying servers, which a company pays for if they use them or not. \nAWS CEO Andy Jassy WSJ D.Live/screen capture \nBut if a company is not carefully watching its Amazon usage, it could run up a huge bill. \n\"In the cloud, it’s so easy to create resources, but the right governance over the usage is needed for you to get the price benefits. You need to be able to start and stop that instance only when the app is running.\" Wang said. \"If you simply spin up the servers without proper governance, you could end up paying more.\" \nAWS doesn't make this task easy. \n\"AWS, their pricing model is very complicated, that is a drawback,\" Wang says. He has complained to AWS about it and believes \"they are improving in that area.\" \nThere are hoards of apps that will monitor Amazon usage. Motorola doesn't use them. Instead, it hired a cloud consultant, 2nd Watch, to help it move to AWS, size everything properly, train the IT staff and set up its own internal systems for watching usage, Wang says. Downsizing Oracle \nLarry Ellison Business Insider \nOne bonus for moving to the cloud is that Motorola has a chance to look at its big expensive apps, like Oracle's database, and ditch them. \n\"In some of the instances, if we can use AWS [databases] instead of Oracle, we are doing that,\" he said, though he's not ready to dump Oracle completely. \"Oracle is still our big partner.\" \nThis is a huge concern for Oracle these days, as Amazon rolls out more database alternatives and has created a tool that helps a company move its database from Oracle to Amazon's homegrown one. Avoiding hard feelings \nMotorola Solutions Chicago cloud team Leo Wang \nOne last thing Motorola needed to work on was getting the IT staff on board. No one lost their jobs because of this move, Wang says. That's because Motorola had an outsourcer called CSC managing its infrastructure. With AWS, it won't need CSC. \nBut there's still some jealousy among the staff. \n\"My team is very excited because they are the core cloud computing team, doing the work. Some other IT teams are feeling left out. I can sense that kind of feeling,\" he said. \nSo, Wang says, he's working on eventually getting the other IT folks trained on the cloud. And people are excited to learn all the latest, greatest cloud tech. It's good for their careers. \"I will help them and they will help me, too.\" Disclosure: Jeff Bezos is an investor in Business Insider through his personal investment company Bezos Expeditions.",

      "title": "Microsoft Project Scorpio Due In A Year: How Much Could It Cost?",
      "text": "We're not sure how much Microsoft will price its next Xbox machine, dubbed Project Scorpio, but we can guess and hope for the best. ( Microsoft ) Advertisement \nMicrosoft has been talking a lot about Project Scorpio ever since the console was officially announced at E3 2016. It turned out to be the biggest announcement of the show, especially seeing as Microsoft decided to focus on the 4K mantra and the 6-teraflops of GPU power. \nWith such a powerful system, we expect it to be better than the PlayStation 4 Pro, having only 4.2-teraflops of GPU power . The Sony system, from what we have seen so far, is capable of running video games at 4K, but not with graphically demanding titles. \nWe expect small indie games to have little problem hitting the 4K ballpark, while higher end games to take advantage of the Checkerboard technique to upscale games to 4K. \nIt would be unfair to expect a lot from the PlayStation 4 Pro seeing as the system only costs $399, the same launch price as the original PlayStation 4. \nAs for Project Scorpio — the next Xbox, many are expecting true 4K games from this console, and that's because it's the promise Microsoft had made. However, it should be noted that Microsoft clearly stated that all games from its own studios will be in 4K, so we take this as saying third-party titles might not run at true 4K at the end of the day. Let's Talk About Price \nThe known hardware specifications of Project Scorpio right now, is the 6-teraflop of GPU power, 320GB/s of bandwidth, eight CPU cores, and a 12 GB of GDDR5 RAM. That's a huge update over the Xbox One S and the PlayStation 4 Pro, so it would be a bit off to believe this console would cost the same as the $299 Xbox One S , or even the cost of the new Sony system. \nIf we follow what Phil Spencer had to say, the man who is the head of the Xbox team, then it's likely easy to tell Project Scorpio won't be super cheap. He calls it a premium console for high-end gamers, which could mean the console is not targeting all Xbox One owners, but just those who require better performance. \nFrom everything Spencer had to say, we'd like to go on a limb and say Project Scorpio might very well cost $499 when it launches in 2017. Six-teraflops of GPU power , eight core CPU and rumored 12GB of GDDR5 RAM doesn't come cheap. Yes, Microsoft has an entire year to find ways to keep costs down, but at this point, Xbox One owners and those still on the fence should keep an eye out for the $499 price tag. Would A $499 Price Be An Issue? \nWe don't see why it would, to be honest. If we look at the Xbox One when it launched, it mainly lost out to the PlayStation 4 due to its higher price and weaker performance. Scorpio will have the performance to back up the high price, and if Microsoft can deliver games that look substantially better than what PlayStation 4 Pro has to offer, then gamers will flock.

The actress paired her Celine shirt dress with a bum-grazing pony and striking purple lip.\nKevin Mazur/AMA2016/WireImage",

      "text": "No. Well, probably not. Let me back up for a minute. Recently, at their Connect event, Microsoft announced the Visual Studio Tools for Tizen . \nIf you're not familiar with Tizen that might not mean anything to you. I know there are a lot of Windows fan[boy]s who read my blog and so for you: Tizen is an operating system created by Samsung. It's had a varied history being used on some phones as well as in watches, TVs, and more. It's generally assumed to have been created as a response to Android with a view to allowing Samsung to control the whole experience on their phones but has had limited success on phones. (Launching an entire mobile ecosystem--apps, services, etc.--is hard.) \nI seem to recall claims of it having been killed off at least a couple of times but it's still going strong. It's going so strong it claims to be installed on 50 million devices! \n\nMicrosoft providing tools to develop apps for this OS makes sense given Satya's (and Microsoft's) aim to provide tooling for: \nany app, any OS, any dev At the event where this was launched, there was no talk of Windows 10 Mobile. Can we read anything into this? Of course, people will read all sorts of things into this but there's no real news about this. \n\nJust because Windows 10 Mobile wasn't mentioned doesn't mean it's gone/going away. It means there's nothing to announce right now. \n\nThis announcement enables those already building with C# to more easily create apps for Tizen devices. Or anyone already with a separate codebase for Tizen apps to combine/aggregate their code. \n\nThink of the mobile version of Windows 10 being in a holding pattern right now. \nIt's just waiting for great things in the future. I suspect that the speed of hardware development is a big (but not the only) issue holding things back in terms of being able to differentiate mobile devices. I saw some early research about the aims of continuum and what it will enable but current hardware costs and capabilities still don't make this possible. \nLet's see what (else?) the future brings...",

      "text": "Microsoft partners state agencies to fight piracy Sunday 27th November , 2016 6:00 am \nMicrosoft has partnered with some government agencies to promote Cyber safety and anti-piracy awareness in Ghana. \nMicrosoft in collaboration with the National Communication Authority, Ministry of Communication, and National Security Secretariat with the support from the US Government is hosted a week-long awareness drive on Cyber Security. \nSpeaking at Copyright Ghana Office as part of the week long awareness campaign, the Country Manager, of Microsoft Ghana, Derek Appiah emphasized the need to fight piracy. \n“Technology is evolving and so is the increased need for security especially around information sharing. What was once a semi-isolated affair and it has become a multi-agency, cross-continent operation, with governments and rights holders alike striving to share information and pool resources,” he said. \nHe explained that the Cyber Security Awareness week kicks off presented information and thought provoking discussions on the economic importance of fighting piracy. \n“The interactive Cyber Security Awareness program will also provide keen insights into the challenges that businesses face in protecting critical data from continual threats of attacks,” he said. \n“We have partnered with the Government of Ghana and the Ghana Copyright office to create awareness, to promote and protect the rights of both users and fabricators of technology solutions” he added. \nHe maintained that networks are getting smarter and so are the threats, which calls for the need to work with governments to strengthen intellectual property laws and crack down on piracy \n“The impact of pirated and counterfeit software has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. As a company, we make Cyber security which broadly includes anti-piracy, our day to day business and as an industry leader we shall continue to forge partnerships to counter these threats to our consumers,” he said. \n–",

      "text": "Word Processing Expert By James Marshall \nMicrosoft offers the Home and Student version of its Office suite. Listing for $150USD ( Compare Prices ), it is an attractive alternative to pricier versions of Microsoft Office.However, the Home and Student version offers fewer programs than other Office versions. It includes Word, PowerPoint, OneNote, and Excel. Many will lament the absence of the Outlook email client and the Access database.Fortunately, Microsoft also offers a better deal for students. The Ultimate Steal program offers a fuller suite of Office programs (Office 2007 Ultimate) at an unbelievably low price.The Ultimate version of Office 2007 includes Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Groove, Publisher, Access, and InfoPath. The student price is an astounding $60USD! ( Compare Prices on retail versions of Office Ultimate )Of course, you must prove your eligibility for The Ultimate Steal. You must be a current student with a valid .edu email address. Further, it is only available to students of approved colleges. \ncontinue reading below our video Choosing the Best Fitness Tracker The Ultimate Steal site will help you determine your eligibility.",

      "text": "\nIn June 2016 we first spotted a white version of the Microsoft Band on the arms of Microsoft’s Panos Panay. At the time some suspected that it may be the elusive Microsoft Band 3, but we later learned it was merely a version of the Band 2 that was exclusive to Microsoft employees.\nBecause it is exclusive we have not really had a good look at the styling of the device, but now Chinese site Nokibar has managed to get some hands-on time with the rare device.\nThe device is of course functionally identical to the Black Band 2 except for being gold where it is silver and white where it is normally black, but still cuts a very nice figure which does make us wonder why Microsoft never released it more widely.\nMicrosoft has confirmed that the Band 2 is being removed from the market and it does not appear that a Band 3 will ever hit the market.\nHave a look below then at what is likely a collector’s item for what will soon be a bygone era of Microsoft wearables.\n",

      "text": "\nLook, timed exclusivity for certain content to certain platforms makes sense- Sony and Microsoft can no longer procure full exclusivity for games like they might have been able to before, in this multiplatform game development era, so they instead try to get timed exclusivity on game DLC, to be able to push the game on their platform.\nIt’s done everywhere- but never before has it been done as extensively as it was done with Destiny (which shouldn’t come as that much of a surprise, given the PS4’s massive success). With Destiny , exclusivity for certain content for PlayStation was for a period of an entire year, with the last bit of exclusive content actually having its exclusivity extended by another year (meaning that by the time Xbox fans get to play it, it will be next year, and Destiny 2 will be out- who will play it then? Who will even care?)\nTimed exclusivity for DLC is (sadly) the norm- heck, Microsoft used to do it with Call of Duty (before Activision went over to Sony for that), and they even had a month’s exclusivity for Skyrim ‘s DLC. But that was all for a month at most- PlayStation fans still got to play that content within a meaningfully reasonable period of time. How it is being done with Destiny , however, is unacceptable- and I seriously hope Bungie drop the practice with Destiny 2 or at least make the exclusivity last shorter.",

I am about to order the Xbox one S but the old BlackFriday16 code is not working, so he will ask you your email address code send a verification code to you (to generate the voucher number) like below: Your verification code is: 474xxx. just check you email and tell him the verification code. After you tell him the code he will generate voucher code and tell you over the chat and then add to you basket the £10.00 code. I think it is the good deal and can be used with any Microsoft bundles. Amex users don't forget there's £30 refunded when you spend £100 at Microsoft. Login to your account online and add offer to your card prior to ordering this deal. Can be used in conjunction with Quidco. - escortboy",

      "text": "Microsoft partners state agencies to fight piracy By CitiFMonline \nMicrosoft has partnered with some government agencies to promote Cyber safety and anti-piracy awareness in Ghana. \nMicrosoft in collaboration with the National Communication Authority, Ministry of Communication, and National Security Secretariat with the support from the US Government is hosted a week-long awareness drive on Cyber Security. \nSpeaking at Copyright Ghana Office as part of the week long awareness campaign, the Country Manager, of Microsoft Ghana, Derek Appiah emphasized the need to fight piracy. \n“Technology is evolving and so is the increased need for security especially around information sharing. What was once a semi-isolated affair and it has become a multi-agency, cross-continent operation, with governments and rights holders alike striving to share information and pool resources,” he said. \nHe explained that the Cyber Security Awareness week kicks off presented information and thought provoking discussions on the economic importance of fighting piracy. \n“The interactive Cyber Security Awareness program will also provide keen insights into the challenges that businesses face in protecting critical data from continual threats of attacks,” he said. \n“We have partnered with the Government of Ghana and the Ghana Copyright office to create awareness, to promote and protect the rights of both users and fabricators of technology solutions” he added. \nHe maintained that networks are getting smarter and so are the threats, which calls for the need to work with governments to strengthen intellectual property laws and crack down on piracy \n“The impact of pirated and counterfeit software has impacted the lives of many users who have been exposed to security breaches. As a company, we make Cyber security which broadly includes anti-piracy, our day to day business and as an industry leader we shall continue to forge partnerships to counter these threats to our consumers,” he said. \n–",

      "text": "By Steven Chan - EBS-Oracle on Nov 28, 2016 \nMicrosoft is changing their packaging of major Windows 10 updates from full operating system downloads to smaller, incremental downloads. This new delivery method is called the Unified Update Platform (UUP). \nThe new UUP delivery method will provide only the Windows 10 patches that have been released since the last time a desktop was updated. Microsoft currently expects to switch to this new delivery method after the Windows 10 Creators Update is released in early 2017. \nWill this work with EBS? \nYes. Windows 10 is certified with all current EBS releases , including EBS 12.1 and 12.2. This new delivery method is not expected to change that. \nMicrosoft emphasizes that nothing changes with Windows 10 itself -- this only modifies the way that Win10 patches are delivered: \nIt’s important to note that with UUP, nothing will look or behave differently on the surface, UUP is all underlying platform and service optimization that happens behind the scenes. \nRelated Articles Will Windows Monthly Rollups Work with EBS? \nThe preceding is intended to outline our general product direction.

      "text": "This Is the New Share Feature Coming in Windows 10 Creators Update GO Microsoft planning new Share UI for Windows 10 users Nov 28, 2016 13:06   As we told you not a long time ago, Microsoft is working on a new Share UI for Windows 10 Creators Update , and it is expected to be released to Windows insiders sometime in the next few days. Now it turns out than an early version of this new sharing feature is already implemented in the existing builds of Windows 10 and you can give it a try right away. As you can see in the screenshot attached to the article, this new sharing UI gives up on the sidebar and instead uses a popup that includes all sharing options, such as the apps that you can use to send the content you want to share. For the moment, this is just an early implementation, and it doesn’t work correctly, but it’s still good enough to provide us with a glimpse into how Microsoft sees the future of sharing in Windows 10. How to enable the new sharing UI Trying out the new sharing feature comes down to just a few registry settings, which according to ghacks , can be applied without a system reboot. All you have to do is to launch the Registry Editor (click the Start menu and type “regedit.exe”) and then navigate to the following location: code HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\SOFTWARE\\Microsoft\\ Look for key called “SharePlatform” (without the quotes), and if it does not exist, create it by right-clicking the Microsoft folder and hitting New > Key. Once this new key is there, look for or create a Dword (32-bit) value called “EnableNewShareFlow” (again without the quotes) and input value 1. Once you’re done, simply close the registry editor and open any Windows 10 application that supports sharing and click the share button to see the new UI in action. Microsoft Edge is one of the supported apps. This feature should be released to insiders sometime very soon, so you could very well wait a bit longer to get it officially (when everything should work correctly anyway).",

Now it turns out than an early version of this new sharing feature is already implemented in the existing builds of Windows 10 and you can give it a try right away. As you can see in the screenshot attached to the article, this new sharing UI gives up on the sidebar and instead uses a popup that includes all sharing options, such as the apps that you can use to send the content you want to share. For the moment, this is just an early implementation, and it doesn’t work correctly, but it’s still good enough to provide us with a glimpse into how Microsoft sees the future of sharing in Windows 10.

      "title": "AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?",
      "text": "AR vs. VR: What's the Difference?   2 p.m. The Microsoft HoloLens uses augmented reality. The HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and Sony PlayStation VR use virtual reality. What's the different between these high-tech headsets? \n2016 has been the year of spending a lot of money to put huge plastic visors on your head. The Google Daydream View , HTC Vive, Oculus Rift , and Sony PlayStation VR are all competing for your wallet, and Microsoft has announced a slew of Windows 10-ready VR headsets on top of them. Microsoft also made its HoloLens available to developers. While the HoloLens seems similar to the other headsets, however, the parallels are entirely superficial. The former are virtual reality headsets, while latter is an augmented reality headset. Here's the difference. Virtual Reality \nVirtual reality headsets completely take over your vision to give you the impression that you're somewhere else. The Vive and Rift displays are opaque, blocking out your surroundings when you wear them. If you put them on when they're turned off, you might think you're blindfolded. \nWhen the headsets turn on, however, the OLED panels inside are refracted by the lenses to completely fill your field of vision with whatever is being display. It could be a game, a 360-degree video, or just the virtual space of the Oculus and SteamVR interfaces. Visually, you're taken to wherever the headsets want you to go—the outside world is replaced with a virtual one. \nMany VR games and apps rely on you staying in a fixed position, either sitting or standing, so you don't walk into walls or knock over things. Because the headsets block out your view (and you're tethered to your computer through them, in some cases), that's a significant danger. \nThe HTC Vive somewhat gets around this by letting you set up a specific VR area. Two external sensors track the headset's position, and the SteamVR software uses those sensors to map out (with your guidance) a square of empty floor it designates as safe to move in. If you try to move beyond that square, a virtual wall fades into view, letting you know you're about to move into a space you might not have cleared. It's a helpful feature that allows limited motion, which opens up some SteamVR games to incorporate actually moving your body around instead of just your head. \nThe upcoming Windows 10 VR headsets hope to get around the need for external sensors by building outward-facing sensors inside the device itself to track the environment. Virtual Control \nThe immersiveness of virtual reality can make you want to move your hands around and expect them to appear in whatever software you're using, but that's almost never the case. Both the Rift and Vive rely on peripherals for control, and without them you can't actually interact with anything. They might be as simple as a gamepad or as complex as the HTC Vive's motion controllers. Even the phone-based Samsung Gear VR has a touchpad on the side to let you control apps. There have been experiments with motion-sensing gloves for VR, but they haven't picked up any traction outside of research yet. Virtual Software \nAs touched on, for both games and apps, virtual reality completely supersedes your surroundings, taking you to other places. Where you are physically doesn't matter. In games, you might sit in the cockpit of a starfighter like in EVE: Valkyrie. In apps, you might virtually tour distant locations as if you were there. There are tons of possibilities in virtual reality, and they all involve replacing everything around you with something else. Augmented Reality \nWhereas virtual reality replaces your vision, augmented reality adds to it. AR devices like the HoloLens Development Edition are transparent, letting you see everything in front of you as if you are wearing a weak pair of sunglasses. The technology is designed for completely free movement. \nMicrosoft calls the HoloLens \"mixed reality\" rather than augmented reality. Academically the term mixed reality refers to the technology behind both virtual and augmented reality in a very broad sense, and Microsoft's use of it seems based on giving the HoloLens a more uniquely branded identity than anything else. The HoloLens is an augmented reality device, and we'll refer to it as such. \nThe HoloLens uses a pair of small projectors aimed at angled lenses built into the visor. The lenses reflect that light while still letting the light of your surroundings pass through, superimposing the projectors' images on top of your view. Any image the HoloLens displays appears to float in front of you. \nThe projectors work in conjunction with a series of cameras built into the visor and Microsoft's \"holographic processing unit\" (HPU) to track your location in relation to where the holograms are virtually placed. The visor constantly scans any surrounding walls or furniture to map out the space around you, and moves the holograms it displays to reflect how you move. This lets you place a hologram in the middle of the room and walk around it as if it were physically there. You can also walk through that hologram, because of course it isn't actually in the room; it fades out when you get very close to it, and reappears when you turn around to face it from the other angle. \nThis technology has a distinct disadvantage compared with virtual reality. While VR completely covers and replaces your field of vision, the HoloLens display only takes up a limited space in front of you. The projectors and lenses are arranged to produce bright, crisp holograms in a rectangular area in the center of your field of vision. When you move your head, the holograms disappear as soon as they hit the edge of the rectangle, making them vanish well before they reach the edge of your vision. Hopefully Microsoft will overcome this limitation as it further develops the HoloLens, because the visual drop-off is the most jarring and disappointing issue with the device. Augmented Control \nThe primary way to interact with the HoloLens is with hand gestures. The cameras on the device can track your hand and finger movements, and use them to perform different functions. The Bloom gesture of opening your upward-pointed hand opens the Start menu and lets you access the HoloLens' software. The Air Tap gesture of pinching your fingers together functions as a click. This is gesture-based control rather than perfect movement tracking; you need to master holding your arm at the right distance directly in front of you for the gesture to register, and you can't simply grab and move holograms quickly with natural actions. \nYou can use the included Clicker peripheral as well, but it only emulates the Air Tap gesture; it doesn't function as its own air mouse for precise control. You can also pair a Bluetooth keyboard with the HoloLens for text input. Augmented Software \nFor apps, augmented reality has nearly limitless possibilities. The HoloLens already projects standard Windows 10 apps as floating windows you can place anywhere around you, effectively giving you an instantly modular multi-monitor computing setup. Other apps, like Holo Studio and HoloPlanner, let you place three-dimensional holograms about your surroundings. Holo Studio lets you create your own holographic dioramas, while HoloPlanner lets you see what your room would look like with difference pieces of furniture places around it. \nFor games, augmented reality can build experiences using your surroundings. The detective game Fragments scans your room and creates crime scenes based on its layout, placing various set pieces around and producing a slightly different experience with each room. RoboRaid detects where the walls are and projects holograms of robotic arms breaking through them and robots pouring out. Young Conker places obstacles all over your furniture, assembling its levels from your surroundings. In all of these cases, the games change to fit the space. The Difference \nVirtual reality and augmented reality accomplish two very different things in two very different ways, despite the similar designs of the devices themselves. VR replaces reality, taking you somewhere else. AR adds to reality, projecting information on top of what you're already seeing. They're both powerful technologies that have yet to make their mark with consumers, but show a lot of promise. They can completely change how we use computers in the future, but whether one or both will succeed is anyone's guess right now.",

      "text": "How to Bring Back the Microsoft Office Picture Manager in Office 2013 or 2016 \nIf you’re using Microsoft Office 2013 or 2016 , you may have noticed that the Microsoft Office Picture Manager is not included. Picture Manager was included in Office 2010 and earlier and allowed you to easily view, edit, and manage pictures. \nMicrosoft has not updated Picture Manager since Office 2003, so the program is old and out of date, as you’d expect. However, if you used Picture Manager in the past, and the features it had back then are all you need, it’s fine to install it alongside Office 2013 or 2016. \nIf you have a disc or folder with the setup files for Office 2010, 2007, or 2003, you can install just Picture Manager from one of those versions of Office. If you don’t have any old versions of Office, Picture Manager was also a component of SharePoint Designer 2010, which is available as a free download from Microsoft. Use one of the links below to download SharePoint Designer 2010. 64-bit: http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=24309 \nThe procedure for installing Picture Manager from an earlier Office version or SharePoint Designer 2010 is essentially the same, so it doesn’t matter whether you install Picture Manager using Office 2010, 2007, or 2003 or SharePoint Designer 2010. \nStart the setup program and follow the on-screen instructions until you get to the Choose the installation you want screen. Then, click “Customize”. \nFor each module listed on the Installation Options tab, including Office Tools, click on the drop-down button and select “Not Available”. \nWe turned off all the modules, but now we’re going to turn the Picture Manager module back on. Click the plus sign to the left of Office Tools module to expand that section. Notice that all the items under Office Tools are set to Not Available, including Microsoft Office Picture Manager. Click the drop-down button to the left of Microsoft Office Picture Manager and select “Run from My Computer”. \nThen, click “Install Now” to install only the Picture Manager. \nIf you’re installing Picture Manager from SharePoint Designer 2010, do the same thing as you would in an Office setup. There are just fewer modules to make “Not Available”. Just make sure Microsoft Office Picture Manager is set to “Run from My Computer” under Office Tools and then click “Install Now”. \nThe progress of the installation displays. \nWhen the following screen displays, click “Close” to close the setup program. \nTo complete the setup, you must reboot your computer, so click “Yes” on the following dialog box. \nOnce you’ve rebooted, the Microsoft Office Picture Manager is available under Recently added on the Start menu in Windows 10. In Windows 8, it doesn’t seem to get added to the Start screen, but a simple search on the Start screen for “picture manager” will easily find it and allow you to open it. \nThe Picture Manager is also available on the Start menu in the Microsoft Office group, which is where it’s available in Windows 7 as well. \nPicture Manager is only included in SharePoint Designer 2010, not SharePoint Designer 2013, and there will not be a SharePoint Designer 2016. Therefore, SharePoint Designer 2010 is the last version to contain Picture Manager.",

      "title": "Is Microsoft Studio Worth the Money?",
      "text": "Is Microsoft Studio Worth the Money? 11/28/2016 02:05 pm ET Quora The best answer to any question \nAnswer by Trausti Thor Johannsson , Developer and tech nerd, on Quora : My daughter who is eleven years old and is the artist in the family and a Lego Mindstorm programmer, watched the introduction with me, her eyes lit up and she asked, \"dad, can I have one?\" She was blown away. I was so happy with this machine, even though it is twice the price of any iMac, I won't be buying it, but there is finally some competition. Apple has seemingly been slacking. My 2014 MacBook Pro looks identical to the 2012 model, which is identical to the 2015 model, the last one to come out. The iMac has not changed in many years either, it did become slimmer, but you would be hard pressed to see that. Apple, like all companies, needs competition. I just can't wait to see what they will do and I wonder if they will they cancel showing the iMac. Apple doesn't do touch screens, and they are very unlikely to change their minds, as cool as it is, and there are people who use it. Last I heard, the authors of Penny Arcade cartoons use Surface to draw on. So, what do I think of the Surface Studio? I like it, a lot. I could see myself using it, but I would not ever use the touch screen, I own Surface, so I know how much I use the touch screen there. The GPU is, well, underwhelming. But the rest of the box, screen, CPU, memory, disk and everything, quite good. It does look like you can't expand the computer at all though. My biggest peeve with Apple is the lack of expandability. Give me the option to buy bigger storage, add more memory, add a second hard disk when I need to. The surface can't be expanded, at all, and like the iMac, has to be replaced completely. The hardware of the machine itself, is nothing new. Nothing that stands out, except perhaps the size of it. The machine is so expensive, that is the weakest part of it is that it could cost as much as $4,000-$5,000 in Norway, and for half that amount, you can get yourself much more than a serious machine. What I took from the introduction, besides the obvious Mac envy, was that Microsoft is all out on creation. Of their surface line, all three models are pretty awesome. But the focus is on creative people making beautiful designs, how easy it is, how much of a design Windows 10 can offer. For me, as an example, I have only looked at Word as a word processor. I have never thought of Word as a productivity tool, when I saw the guy make a script with sketches on it, I had never seen such work being done in Word before. I had never thought of Word doing that. When the video played, and the woman artist drew and used the surface dial to rotate the image, pick colors, etc. and it was incredible. Mind blown. For me, the whole introduction was all about creativity and how Windows 10 enabled it, and the surface dial was a key part of it. That is what I took away from the introduction. I honestly think watching this swayed me more towards Windows than anything I have seen in the past. If this is what we can expect from Microsoft, I just might join. Everything I do today is pretty much platform agnostic, but so far I have been pleasantly surprised by Windows 10, and Microsoft is trying to get us to go back to Windows and they even set the standard for machines and design. The winner object of the introduction, the surface dial : [image 1] And Penny Arcade is already using the Studio to draw on: Penny Arcade - News - The Surface Studio! \nThis question originally appeared on Quora - the knowledge sharing network where compelling questions are answered by people with unique insights.

      "text": "\nMicrosoft’s Chinese chatbot, Xiaoice has been a huge in China with more than 40 million users. The chatbot, introduced back in early 2014, uses artificial intelligence to intelligently answer questions about almost anything. Now, as it turns out, Xiaoice is filtering certain topics and avoids answering questions regarding those topics. This was reported by CNN Money l ast week, which claimed that Xiaoice avoided answering questions regarding Donald Trump. Additionally, the chatbot also avoided questions about China’s President, Xi Jinping and questions with the words “topple the Communist Party.” When asked about the filtered topics, Xiaoice simply replies “Am I stupid? Once I answer you’d take a scereengrab”.\nWhen asked about this, a Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that the chatbot is, indeed, filtering out a “range of topics”:\n“We are committed to creating the best experience for everyone chatting with Xiaoice. With this in mind, we have implemented filtering on a range of topics.”\nMicrosoft didn’t specify which topics the chatbot is filtering out — however, it is possible that the company started filtering out the topics after the Tay fiasco earlier this year. For those unfamiliar, Microsoft launched a chatbot called “Tay” earlier this year which made a lot of racist and offensive comments. Microsoft, of course, shut down the chatbot and it is yet to make a comeback. The company did state that it’ll be taking actions to ensure this doesn’t happen again in the future, and Xiaoice filtering some topics out may have something to do with this.\n",

      "text": "Getting Microsoft’s Xbox One entertainment console up and running is exciting, but it isn’t without its headaches. Sometimes we’re so excited to get a new device home that we forget about the essentials. We don’t even realize that there are things we need that we don’t have. Sure, you’ve purchased a subscription to Xbox Live and picked up a second controller. Next you’ll need to connect an Xbox One to a monitor or TV.\nAdvertisement\nThe good news is that connecting an Xbox One to a monitor or TV is incredibly straight forward. With the right cables and accessories, you’ll find yourself gaming in no time. The bad news is that you can also find yourself forced into purchasing an adapter or some other accessories if your equipment is a little outdated or doesn’t meet the Xbox One’s requirements.\nHere’s how to connect an Xbox One to a monitor or TV.\nHow to Connect an Xbox One to a Monitor or TV: Finding the Right Xbox One If you have yet to purchase an Xbox One, your process starts with deciding which of the Xbox One consoles that Microsoft sells is perfect for your setup.\nGet an iPad Pro w/ 4G LTE for just $499 (refurb)\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nFirst, take some time to find out whether your television has 4K Ultra HD technology or whether it’s capable of 720P or 1080P. Without this information, you can’t be sure whether you’re buying the right Xbox One for your needs. The Xbox One S is the only Xbox console that’s able to output video at 4K Ultra HD resolution. It can also output 1080P and 720P resolution. In short, it’s the Xbox to have for every type of entertainment setup.\nThat being said, you can save money by buying the original Xbox One if you don’t have a 4K display. That original console works just fine on televisions that support HD resolution. If your television wasn’t purchased in the last two years, it will not have 4K support anyway.\nAdvertisement\nRead: Xbox One vs Xbox One S\nThe Xbox One and Xbox One S only have a single way to output to a monitor or television: HDMI.\nHow to Connect an Xbox One to a Monitor or TV: Finding the Right Display Finding the right display for your Xbox One is crucial. You’ll need a monitor or TV with a resolution that you’re comfortable with and all the right ports. You’ll want to consider sound too.\nThe Xbox One and Xbox One S both have HDMI out, making them compatible with just about any television or monitor that you can purchase today. HDMI ports have been a defining feature of monitors and television sets for years now. Look at the back of the television or monitor that you want to plug into your Xbox One. If it has an HDMI port, you’re ready to go.\nAdvertisement\nRead: 4K TV: What You Need to Know\nIf you’re planning to connect an Xbox One to a monitor or television that you haven’t yet purchased, be careful to buy a display that has an HDMI port. If you don’t, you’ll find yourself in need of adapters and possibly troubleshooting resolutions.\nThere are cables and adapters that you can buy to connect an HDMI port to a VGA equipped display, but that experience is going to vary greatly. Amazon offers more than a few options to choose from. Likewise, there are DVI to HDMI converters if you have a monitor equipped with that port on Amazon too.\nAdvertisement\nRegardless of whether you’re purchasing a new monitor or reusing an existing display, be sure that you have a way to get sound out of your console. We’re so used to televisions having speakers that we often forget that most monitors don’t. If the monitor you have on hand or purchase doesn’t have speakers, you’ll need to connect some through the Optical Audio Port, also known as the S/PDIF port. You can also plug in a pair of headphones to your Xbox One Controller.\nHow to Connect an Xbox One to a Monitor or TV To connect an Xbox One to a monitor or television, unbox the free HDMI cable that came with your console. If the monitor or television has an HMDI port built in, simply connect one end to the Xbox One’s HDMI Out port.\nNext connect the other end to the HDMI port on your display. Monitors should begin working immediately, but televisions may need to be turned to their INPUT channels to work. How you get your TV to INPUT depends on its make and model. Refer to the manual that came with your television if you don’t know how.\nSome setups are more complicated. If you find that the Xbox One S isn’t outputting 4K to your television, or something is keeping your display from running correctly, you need to open the Settings app on your console. To do so, press the glowing Xbox logo on your controller to bring up the Xbox Guide.\nNext, navigate to the Settings pane. It’s the second from the bottom.\nSelect All Settings.\nNow select Display & Sound from the menu on the left side of your display.\nThe Video Output menu lets you decide what resolution your monitor or television gets from the Xbox One and what its refresh rate is.\nYou can also toggle borders around some apps downloaded to your Xbox One. The Advanced Video Settings’ 4K TV details menu is great for troubleshooting issues with 4K video.\nGood luck connecting an Xbox One to a monitor or television.",

      "title": "How to Play Xbox One Games Without Internet",
      "text": "One of the biggest myths still floating around about Microsoft’s Xbox One entertainment console is that enjoying it without an internet connection is impossible. Let’s be clear, if Microsoft had continued on its original course, you wouldn’t be able to do so longer than a day. At first, Microsoft’s software design called for Xbox Live to check with Microsoft’s servers to determine if users own their games once every twenty-four hours. All disc-based games would have been automatically converted to digital titles when inserted into the console. When people reacted badly to this scheme, Microsoft was forced to change things. You can play Xbox One games without Internet – as long as you lay some ground work first.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, disc-based games don’t become digital because you insert them into the console. They install, but you’re free to keep that disc, loan it to others and share it. This also has the side-effect of ensuring that when you purchase a game from a store, it’ll work on an Xbox One that doesn’t have access to the internet.\nHere’s how to play Xbox One games without Internet.\nHow to Play Xbox One Games Without Internet: Before We Begin Before we begin, it’s very important that you understand how Microsoft’s offline features for Xbox One work.\nGet an iPad Pro w/ 4G LTE for just $499 (refurb)\nAdvertisement\nAdvertisement\nThere’s a digital switch built into the console that turns off its radios and stops it from trying to reach out to Xbox Live regularly. It’s because of this switch that playing Xbox One games without Internet is possible.\nPlaying offline does have some side-effects. First, you won’t be able to go to a friend’s house and pick up where you left off on any of your games. That’s because the Xbox One uses cloud storage to pull this off. If you do plan on going from your Xbox One console that’s not connected to the internet to one that is, remember to keep your game saves on a flash drive so that you don’t lose them.\nDestiny can’t be played without an internet connection.\nAdvertisement\nSecond, to play an Xbox One game offline, the game needs to not have a reliance on a server. Put more plainly, you can’t play a game that was designed for online connectivity specifically. That means Destiny is out of the question. Many of Ubisoft’s titles are too. Single player games should still work though. Be sure to look on the back of your game’s casees to find out whether it needs to be connected to the internet constantly.\nKeep in mind that you won’t be able to download extra content or updates for any titles that you own on Xbox One without an internet connection. You won’t be able to watch Blu-ray movies or stream videos from Microsoft’s Movies & TV store either. That’s because both of those experiences also rely on the console’s internet connection.\nHow to Play Xbox One Games Without Internet: Let’s Begin Be sure that you’ve loaded up your Xbox One console with all the digital titles that you have in your collection. Download them from the Collection area called My Games and Apps. Next, open each of the games so that your console syncs your latest saves from Xbox Live. Note that this step is only for users that have an web connected console and are looking to transition their entire experience to being offline only.\nNew Xbox One buyers will need to find a solid internet connection so that they can download any console software updates that might be pending. Microsoft’s Xbox website lets you store the software update on a flash drive for installation later here .\nDouble tap the glowing Xbox logo on your Xbox One Wireless Controller to bring up the Xbox Guide. The Xbox Guide is a menu that slides out from the right side of our screen.\nAdvertisement\nOnce the menu is open highlight the Settings area at the bottom of the menu.\nNow select All Settings from the Settings area.\nAdvertisement\nYour console should have closed the Xbox Guide and taken you to the Xbox One’s dedicated Settings app. Select Network from the menu on the left side of your television’s display.\nNow select Network Settings.\nFrom the Network Settings menu, look for the Go Offline option on the left side of your display. Go ahead and select it.\nAt this point, your console will stop trying to connect to Microsoft’s servers and the internet. All of your game saves will stay on your console’s internal hard drive, or the external hard drive that you added to it and setup previously.\nOne thing to look out for are your Achievements. According to Microsoft’s support article on the subject, the Xbox One only has a limited cache for storing Achievements that you’ve unlocked. As such, the company recommends users frequently connect their console to Xbox Live if they’re worried about losing any Achievements. Unfortunately, the company doesn’t reveal how many Achievements can be stored.\nRead: 31 Xbox One Tips for a Better Experience\nGood luck playing Xbox One games without Internet. It might have taken a tidal wave of negative feedback for Microsoft to make this possible, but it’s definitely a good thing the feature got added in the end.",

      "text": "By: Starbucks via Business Wire News Releases   07:00 AM EST King County Emergency Shelter Campaign for Homeless Families Gets More Than $3 Million Boost from Starbucks, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Key Bank Foundation With family homelessness at a crisis point, Seattle-area business leaders, including Starbucks, are joining together to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside.” \nThe Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place. Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association, which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. This Smart News Release features multimedia. View the full release here: http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20161129005572/en/ \nWith family homelessness at a crisis point, King County’s business leaders are joining an unprecedented employer-led effort to raise more than $3 million to ensure “No Child Sleeps Outside” (Photo: Business Wire) \nFollowing a 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year, families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place, and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing (providing assistance and services to help those experiencing homelessness to quickly find housing), funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place, which runs the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County – serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation, and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” \nStarbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1 st and 31 st , up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, co-founders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children, and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing, and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter, and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services, and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development for just dollars per night. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world.

      "text": "Thumbnail November 29, 2016 07:00   \nSEATTLE- The Starbucks Foundation and Schultz Family Foundation announced today their support of the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign by Mary’s Place. Together with other businesses, they are joining an unprecedented effort to mobilize the community, and contributing over $3 million to provide safe emergency shelter for the estimated 500 unsheltered families in King County, including hundreds of children. The campaign also has the support of companies like Microsoft Corp., Dick’s Drive-In, Comcast, Alaska Airlines, Weyerhaeuser, Expedia, Nordstrom, Bank of America, Key Bank Foundation, Group Health, Seattle Mariners, as well as the Seattle Metropolitan Chamber of Commerce and Downtown Seattle Association, which together represent thousands of Seattle businesses. \nFollowing a 20 percent jump in the homeless count last year, families with young children are waiting months for emergency shelter, leaving many sleeping on the streets, in cars and parks across the community. This move by The Starbucks Foundation, Schultz Family Foundation, Microsoft, and others supports an immediate expansion of Mary’s Place, and responds to the critical, short-term need to bring unsheltered families inside. Separately, the organizations also expressed support for the mayor’s Pathways Home strategy, which addresses some of the systemic problems contributing to the homeless crisis. It includes a shift towards rapid rehousing (providing assistance and services to help those experiencing homelessness to quickly find housing), funding for expanded shelter hours at several shelters, and the creation of lockers for the homeless. Recognizing that city and county reforms to provide affordable housing will take months or years, supporters of the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign believe it is critical to provide immediate emergency shelter for hundreds of children. \n“The 500 families with small children who are sleeping outside in King County cannot wait for the promised reforms and housing that will take a year or more,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer of Starbucks and co-founder of the Schultz Family Foundation. “We need to treat this daily tragedy with the same urgency that would follow any natural disaster. This is a short-term but urgent humanitarian need, and we are proud to join other Seattle employers in the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign.” \nMary’s Place, which runs the annual No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, is a 17-year-old emergency shelter organization with six locations throughout the county that operates primarily with private funding. Mary’s Place provides emergency shelter to nearly 40 percent of families experiencing homelessness across King County – serving 115-120 families per night, and 400 families throughout the year. However, 20 families a day are still turned away because there is not enough capacity at these shelters. \n“King County is facing an unprecedented homelessness crisis and more than 500 families are sleeping outside each night in places unfit for habitation,” said Marty Hartman, executive director of Mary’s Place. “It breaks our hearts to have to turn them away each day. We are so incredibly grateful for the support of our business partners like Starbucks, Microsoft, the Schultz Family Foundation, and so many others who are making it possible for us to expand our services and bring more families inside to warmth, safety, and stability.” \n“No child should have to sleep outside at night. We must come together as a community to address this vital need as a local imperative,” said Brad Smith, Microsoft president. “We are pledging $1 million, including $250,000 to Mary’s Place, to address homelessness across King County. We will support partners throughout the area to pursue both short- and long-term systemic solutions, including permanent housing.” \nStarbucks Foundation to Match Customer Donations in more than 200 King County Stores in December \nIn addition to a $1 million financial contribution to the No Child Sleeps Outside campaign, The Starbucks Foundation will match every dollar donated by customers in participating King County Starbucks® stores between December 1 st and 31 st , up to an additional $1 million dollars to help shelter local families. The Starbucks Foundation will also allocate an additional $250,000 to other local nonprofits, including the United Way, YWCA, and Youth Care, that connect homeless families and youth to job placement programs and other critical services. \nHoward and Sheri Schultz, co-founders of the Schultz Family Foundation, are also personally contributing $1 million to Mary’s Place through the Schultz Family Foundation to expand both shelter capacity and the organization’s ability to move families into permanent housing. In addition, the Schultz Family Foundation will continue to support other Seattle homelessness organizations to reduce the number of unsheltered youth and young adults. \nAbout Mary’s Place \nMary’s Place empowers homeless women, children, and families to reclaim their lives by providing shelter, nourishment, resources, healing, and hope in a safe community. Mary’s Place operates six crisis response family shelters providing refuge and community for 400 family members experiencing homelessness. The organization focuses on an innovative strategy of combining prevention, emergency shelter, and resources for transition into housing to bring families out of homelessness. At their Family Center, Mary’s Place provides shelter, services, and resources in the same building. This allows families, together with their assigned Housing & Wellness Advocates, to focus on individualized plans for overcoming barriers and finding employment and stable housing. It does all this cost effectively in loaned buildings that are empty and awaiting development for just dollars per night. \nAbout Starbucks \nSince 1971, Starbucks Coffee Company has been committed to ethically sourcing and roasting high-quality arabica coffee. Today, with stores around the globe, the company is the premier roaster and retailer of specialty coffee in the world. Through our unwavering commitment to excellence and our guiding principles, we bring the unique Starbucks Experience to life for every customer through every cup.
