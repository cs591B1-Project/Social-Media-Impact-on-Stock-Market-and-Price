      "text": "Pokémon Go leaks suggest upcoming event with Starbucks Nintendo/Niantic John Martin @JMartWillHelp 1 min ago \nPokémon Go might be gearing up for a promotional event with Starbucks, turning the cafes into PokéStops or Gyms featuring exclusive items, in-game and in real life. Allegra Frank of IGN reports that there have been images cropping up on Reddit that suggest the promotion will launch on December 8, 2016. The information from these leaks point to a new item called the Pokémon Go Frappuccino Blended Beverage. This item can be obtained within the game and ordered as a real beverage at participating Starbucks locations. A web page that serves as a primer for the event reads \"The world of Pokémon Go is about to expand with new Pokémon and a new Starbucks beverage!\" This might hint at the inclusion of the Generation 2 Pokémon , the codes for which were leaked earlier this year. We'll just have to wait until Thursday, December 8, 2016 to see if this promotion is the real deal. Recommended",

      "text": "‘Pokémon Go’ Gen 2 Coming This Week? Starbucks Promotion May Bring New Pokémon Close Please agree to the terms and conditions. Email * ‘Pokémon Go’ Generation 2 Update: Stock Up On These Candies Before It Drops \nAfter a Starbucks internal memo was leaked online, sparking the rumors that the Gen 2 Pokémon were coming to Pokémon Go, a new memo has begun to circulate within Starbucks stores, further alluding to the inclusion of new Pokémon coming to the popular mobile game. \nThe leaked Starbucks promotional memo states the Pokémon Go promotion begins Thursday, Dec. 8. The majority of Starbucks will become either a PokeStop or a Gym and will offer a special Pokémon Go frappucino. \nThe Pokemon Go memo being sent to Starbucks employees Imgur \nHowever, the wording on this new Starbucks promotional document doesn’t indicate that Gen 2 will be added in conjunction with the partnership, but SilphRoad believes it’s highly likely the 100 new Pokémon will come this week. \nFrom the insistence of the launch of “version 2” of Pokémon Go in the first leaked memo to the fact that the client-side code is already included in the current version of the app for all 100 of the next Pokémon, which was discovered on Nov. 7 in The Silph Road’s APK mine , Gen 2 is very close to arriving. \nAccording to Silph Road, Niantic could hypothetically roll out the new species with a server-side-only change and begin spawning the new species without the need for an app update. \nThere is still a lot we don’t know about the partnership between Niantic and Starbucks, but if Gen 2 were to show up in the game, this would be a perfect time to see an uptick in usage. \nNiantic has done a great job recently giving regular updates to Pokémon Go , including Daily Missions, changes to CP and Gyms, and adding the elusive Ditto into the mobile game. \nIf Gen 2 is added, the only Pokémon that would be missing are the Legendary Bird Trio (Moltres, Articuno and Zapdos), and Mewtwo and Mew. \nDo you think Gen 2 will be added alongside the Starbucks promotion? Let us know in the comments section below. ",

      "text": "'Pokémon Go' may get 100 new Pokémon this week A leaked Starbucks employee manual hints at brand new creatures and partnerships for Niantic's AR game. Share Save \nPokémon Go is about to get bigger, according to a handful of Starbucks employee guides that found their way online early this week. The images have not been verified by Niantic, the Pokémon Company or Starbucks, but Reddit sleuths claim that verified Starbucks employees have vouched for their veracity. \n\"The world of Pokémon Go is about to expand with new Pokémon and a new Starbucks beverage!\" the \"Barista need-to-know\" guide says. The flyers indicate that Pokémon Go 's second generation will kick off on Thursday, December 8th. \nIn November, curious fans dove into Pokémon Go 's data and found references to 100 creatures from Pokémon Gold and Silver , plus code for the shapeshifting Pokémon, Ditto. This little pink blob of a character hit Pokémon Go at the end of November. \nThe employee guide also outlines a new corporate partnership between Pokémon Go and Starbucks. On December 8th, the flyers say the majority of Starbucks stores across the United States will become PokéStops or Gyms, and they'll offer a new Pokémon Go -branded Frappuccino (which is basically a Vanilla Bean Frap with raspberry syrup and whole, free-dried blackberries). The drink will actually show up as an icon in Pokémon Go , apparently. \nThe guide prepares baristas for dealing with an influx of Pokémon Go players, some of whom may not order a drink while collecting Pokéballs and potions. Starbucks' advice is to \"make the moment right and use your best judgement\" in dealing with Pokémon Go tourists. \nCorporate partnerships aren't new territory for Pokémon Go developer Niantic, the former Google company also responsible for the mobile AR game Ingress . Niantic used sponsored locations in Ingress and it's previously discussed implementing a similar system in Pokémon Go . The game even launched in Japan with a McDonald's partnership. \nWe reached out to Niantic for confirmation or clarification on the Starbucks guides, and were told the company doesn't comment on rumor or speculation. At least this particular rumor will be settled soon: Keep an eye on your Pokémon Go app this Thursday. ",

      "title": "McDonald’s Is Going Right At Starbucks’ Throat With Complex Coffee Drinks For Half The Price",
      "text": "Getty Image\nThere’s no doubt that consumers are more likely to buy something based on the popularity of a brand. Air Jordans will always beat Starburys . That is if they even still make Starburys. Coke will always beat RC Cola. It’s difficult to compete with name recognition. Such has been the case with Starbucks . People love the place so much that no one even seems to bat an eye over the price. Well, McDonald’s begs to differ. \nThe company started McCafe almost a decade ago in hopes of challenging Dunkin’ Donuts and Starbucks and has decided to start over and completely reinvent itself in the new year by focusing on sustainable beans and a price point their competitors can’t compete with. Basically they’re attacking Starbucks’ strength (single origin coffee), attacking their weakness (price), while seeming to go all in on another weakness which customers love ( too much sugar ). \n“We’re really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,” Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights told Bloomberg . \nPart of the new McCafe will include $1 drip coffee (as opposed to $2 dollars at Starbucks) and only $2 for specialty coffees like a Latte, Peppermint Mocha, or Frappe. Will there be sugar caramels and sauces on top? You’d better f*cking believe it. \nThe revamp includes adding $12,000 espresso machines to many of their restaurants. That might seem like a lot of cash to compete with Starbucks, but that’s the price of high-quality coffee. The difference is that McDonald’s doesn’t want to hit you in the wallet the way the other top brands might. They’re willing to spend more money to ensure that you don’t have to. \nNobody thinks McDonald’s will become the 2016 version of “Central Perk”. The company will always be known more for McNuggets than macchiatos. They’re just hoping consumers will give their coffee a try. They think you might actually like it. At the worst, you only spend $1 for a coffee that ends up getting cold in your car’s cup holder. \nIf that’s not enough, they have all day breakfast now. You have to wash down your McGriddle with something and it might as well be a reasonably-priced sustainable sourced coffee. Will it be a major move in the fast food wars? Time will tell!\n",

      "title": "Pokemon GO’s Next Massive Update May Add New Pokemon",
      "text": "A huge update for Pokemon GO appears as a possible leak by coffee company Starbucks, as a memo sent to employees hints at ‘new Pokemon’ being added to the game. Over the past week, Niantic has made several changes to its massively popular augmented-reality app Pokemon GO , including fixing Gym training and rolling out the new tracker tool to several regions . But according to a new leak, this is not the only set of changes that the developer is working on, as a massive new update to the game is said to be right around the corner.\nThe details of this upcoming Pokemon GO update arrive via Reddit , where a user posted a memo from Starbucks to its employees. The leaked documents explain that, on December 8, the “majority of company-owned” Starbucks locations in the United States will be turned into either PokeStops or Gyms and on the same day, “new Pokemon” will be added to the game. By locating the PokeStop/Gym Starbucks location within the game, players will “unlock” the Pokemon GO Frappucino Blended Beverage. The Pokemon GO drink is a vanilla frappucino “evolved” with raspberry syrup and blackberries.\nNiantic has yet to announce the update, but several Starbucks employees have verified that the memo is real. However, even without these employees’ confirmations, the Pokemon GO update certainly seems likely. After all, the Starbucks partnership wouldn’t be the first time that Niantic had teamed up with businesses, as a McDonalds partnership began in Japan .\n\nMeanwhile, recent datamining of the game’s files suggested that Pokemon GO is about to add Gen 2 Pokemon to the game. This, combined with Niantic CEO John Hanke’s confirmation that Pokemon GO will add more new generations of Pokemon in future, all seem to affirm what the leaked Starbucks memo is saying.\nWhat does remain a big question, however, is whether the Starbucks promotion will come to other territories and whether the new Pokemon will be US-only too. There are Starbucks locations all over the world, and it would make sense to turn Starbucks everywhere into Gyms and PokeStops in theory, but that would be a large undertaking. So, there may be no plans to take the partnership global.\nMoreover, Niantic has previously delayed updates and performed a staggered, global rollout for Pokemon GO features, such as the aforementioned tracker tool. Global fans will certainly be upset if they are forced to wait an extra amount of time for the new creatures just because of their location, so it will be interesting to see whether Niantic heads off these concerns by making the new Pokemon available to everyone at the same time when the update hits later this week.\nPokemon GO is available now for Android and iOS devices.\n",

      "text": "Starbucks’ New Drink Is a Holiday Cookie in a Cup Could this be the sweetest drink yet? Brigitt Earley Subscribe This article originally appeared on Real Simple On Friday, Starbucks unveiled the newest addition to its lineup of seasonal beverages . The drink, a Snickerdoodle Hot Cocoa, is available starting Friday, December 2, at participating Starbucks’ stores throughout the United States. And it promises to be an all-time favorite cookie… in a cup. The warm cocoa drink isn’t your typical dark chocolate variety. Instead, this one , which supposedly mimics the smell and taste of a snickerdoodle cookie (you know, that soft and buttery cinnamon-vanilla treat), is made with steamed milk, white chocolate sauce, and cinnamon dolce syrup, then topped with whipped cream and a dusting of cinnamon sugar. Does the cold-weather favorite deliver on the holiday promise? Some staffers thought it was a bit too sweet, while others reported that it tasted like warm, flavored milk (not necessarily a bad thing, but not likely to become their new go-to order). Others happily sipped the liquid cookie. It does have a distinct holiday aroma, so if it's that nostalgic scent you're looking for, we suggest giving it a try. (For a spiked version, you can try our holiday cookie cocktails !) But if what you really love is a rich, creamy mug of hot cocoa , we suggest you stick with the plain variety—and just buy a cookie to go along with it. Starbucks also offers a range of other holiday hot cocoa beverages to choose from, including peppermint hot cocoa, salted caramel hot cocoa, and white chocolate hot cocoa. Starbucks says the seasonal beverages will be available “through the holidays,” so you’re best bet is to give the festive drinks a try as soon as you can. Related:",

      "text": "Catch These Perfect Pokemon Gifts \nIf you’re a Pokemon Go fan, you might want to pay close attention the next time you’re in Starbucks morning line. It seems that rumors have been swirling about a possible Starbucks-specific event that could be coming to Niantic’s massively popular augmented reality Pokemon game in the future. This could also mean (hold your breath) possible new additions to the game.We’ve only been waiting months for that to happen. \nAfter a Redditor claiming to work for Starbucks had posted what seemed to be an internal memo that detailed some sort of upcoming event. From here the rumor mill was set ablaze that the event could very well include new Pokemon! The Pokemon Go subreddit has information from a user that supposedly nabbed a Starbucks promotion page that was only shared with employees. Apparently, Pokemon and Starbucks are collaborating on a promotion that’s meant to begin Thursday, December 8th. That’s this Thursday! \nThe promotion reads that Starbucks locations that aren’t Poke Stops already will be transformed into one, and anyone who’s interested can stop by and purchase a special drink to enjoy while catching Pokemon. The important part, however, is the part that reads “The world of Pokemon Go is about to expand with NEW Pokemon and a new Starbucks beverage.” \nThere’s nothing to do now other than wait and see if this is actually going to happen this week. But the image itself of the promotion does indeed look pretty real. Niantic has always kept pretty hush-hush about events and updates like these, having previously let the secret of Ditto out into the wild without making an announcement beforehand. So hopefully it’s true and we’ll be getting both a tasty new drink from Starbucks and a bevy of new Pokemon to boot. Share",

      "title": "'Pokémon Go' Gen 2 release date leaked by Starbucks employees? Everything we know so far",
      "text": "H as the Pokémon Go \" Gen 2 \" release date leaked? In two days, Pokémon Go fans may see a massive release of brand-new Pokémon from the second generation of games. Or they may just get a branded coffee drink.\nA document posted Monday evening to the Pokémon Go subreddit and purportedly leaked from Starbucks appears to brief employees about a new Pokémon Go promotion that begins on Thursday. Pokémon Go fans who want to see Gen 2 Pokémon added to the game are hoping that the Starbucks promotion portends good news.\nStarbucks on Dec. 8 will begin a promotion for a new 'Pokémon Go' drink, if this document supposedly leaked from Starbucks is legit. Source: Cowpro/Reddit Pokémon Go Gen 2 release date leak: Is the Starbucks document legit? Mic 's own Tim Mulkerin, a former Starbucks employee, believes that the document looks legitimate, based on the second page that explains how to prepare a \"Pokémon Go Frappuccino Blended Creme\" drink. The directions adhere to internal company language, and the chart follows the Starbucks standard formula for recipes, according to the ex-barista.\n\"Starbucks has nothing to share at this time,\" a representative for Starbucks told Mic . The web has decided to run with this rumor even without confirmation, largely because players are so desperate for new Gen 2 Pokémon.\nThis 'Pokémon Go' Frappuccino may be all Pokémon fans actually get out of Starbucks on Dec. 8. Source: Cowpro/Reddit Pokémon Go Gen 2 release date leak: New Pokémon coming with a December update? Pokémon Go fans have latched onto the beginning of the supposedly leaked document as hope that Gen 2 Pokémon are on the way.\n\"The world of Pokémon Go is about to expand with new Pokémon and a new Starbucks beverage,\" reads the document, which only concerns itself with said beverage for its remainder. \"Starbucks is collaborating with Pokémon in their new update on Thursday, Dec. 8.\"\nBecause Starbucks declined in its purported training document to give further details about what \"new Pokémon\" means, fans are more than happy to fill in the blanks. The general consensus is that the Dec. 8 update to Pokémon Go could be the long-rumored introduction of Gen 2.\n'Pokémon Go' fans are so excited about the release of Gen 2 Pokémon that they'll take any hope they can find. Source: bronconose/Reddit If Niantic would give official word as to the progress of adding Gen 2 Pokémon to Pokémon Go , fans wouldn't have to read so far into leaks like these. Pokémon Go fans are getting salty about the lack of any official update.\nSome 'Pokémon Go' fans don't have hope that Niantic will ever make it clear precisely when Gen 2 Pokémon will be added to the game. Source: Pudinx/Reddit Pokémon Go Gen 2 release date leak: How the Starbucks promotion will change the game T here is one concrete change to Pokémon Go that will support the Starbucks promotion. According to the leaked document, many Starbucks locations owned by the company (versus franchise locations) will appear as either a PokéStop or a gym in Pokémon Go .\nIf the Starbucks-branded PokéStops spit out supplies like regular PokéStops, you might get some extra Pokéballs during the Starbucks promotion. But unless these gyms will be permanent additions to Pokémon Go , it's doubtful that the Starbucks promotion will have long-term effects on the game.\nMore Pokémon Go hacks, tips and tricks If you'll be praying for Gen 2 Pokémon on Thursday, you may also want to check out Mic 's Pokémon Go guides. Here's everything you need to know about finding the long-awaited Pokémon Ditto , creating new PokéStops , how to maximize your chances of catching Pokémon, the newest top attackers and defenders lists and fresh information about how Poké Stops distribute Pokémon eggs .",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 4:36pm \nYes, that headline is accurate. \nA Starbucks employee guide that hit the internet earlier this week claims that the coffee shop will soon get an exclusive Pokémon drink and that the mobile game’s second generation of creatures, likely including characters from the Gold and Silver generation of the series, will release on Thursday December 8th. \nIt’s important to note that the validity of the scanned documents has not been verified by Starbucks, The Pokémon Company, Nintendo or Niantic, though various Starbucks employees have vouched for their veracity on Reddit . \nThis isn’t the first time we’ve heard speculation that 100 new Pocket Monsters are set to hit Pokémon Go, with rumours also surfacing earlier this month courtesy of a variety of websites . \nOn December 8th the majority of Starbucks stores across the United States will reportedly become PokeStops or Gyms and the coffee shop will also offer a Pokémon Go-branded Frappuccino, with the drink reportedly showing up as an icon in Pokemon Go. \nThe guide seems to be designed to prepare baristas for an onslaught of Pokémon Go players who likely won’t be interested in actually purchasing an overpriced coffee. The guide advises employees to use their best judgment when dealing with Pokémon Go players. \nEngadget , the publication that originally reported the story, reached out to Niantic for clarification and was told that the developer doesn’t comment on rumours or speculation. \nHere’s hoping we’ll get to catch Typhlosion soon.",

      "text": "Stay on target Pokémon Go Finally Gets Ditto via Stealth Update Catch These Perfect Pokemon Gifts If you’re a Pokemon Go fan, you might want to pay close attention the next time you’re in Starbucks morning line. It seems that rumors have been swirling about a possible Starbucks-specific event that could be coming to Niantic’s massively popular augmented reality Pokemon game in the future. This could also mean (hold your breath) possible new additions to the game.We’ve only been waiting months for that to happen.\nAfter a Redditor claiming to work for Starbucks had posted what seemed to be an internal memo that detailed some sort of upcoming event. From here the rumor mill was set ablaze that the event could very well include new Pokemon! The Pokemon Go subreddit has information from a user that supposedly nabbed a Starbucks promotion page that was only shared with employees. Apparently, Pokemon and Starbucks are collaborating on a promotion that’s meant to begin Thursday, December 8th. That’s this Thursday!\nThe promotion reads that Starbucks locations that aren’t Poke Stops already will be transformed into one, and anyone who’s interested can stop by and purchase a special drink to enjoy while catching Pokemon. The important part, however, is the part that reads “The world of Pokemon Go is about to expand with NEW Pokemon and a new Starbucks beverage.”\nThere’s nothing to do now other than wait and see if this is actually going to happen this week. But the image itself of the promotion does indeed look pretty real. Niantic has always kept pretty hush-hush about events and updates like these, having previously let the secret of Ditto out into the wild without making an announcement beforehand. So hopefully it’s true and we’ll be getting both a tasty new drink from Starbucks and a bevy of new Pokemon to boot.",

      "title": "Starbucks launching Pokémon Go promotion with gyms, special beverage",
      "text": "Since launching earlier this year, Pokémon Go has already gotten people into stores, restaurants, and cafés to capture pokémon and achieve other perks. After discovering hints that Pokémon Go may someday offer perks at specific, promoted locations, app data miners have long suspected that this was only the beginning.\nOne of many images that have been posted today that apparently confirm the Starbucks/ Pokémon Go crossover. Their suspicions were proven by a leak from Starbucks employees on Tuesday. The leak confirms that the coffee chain will launch a Pokémon Go promotion across the United States starting Thursday, December 8. The news, posted on Reddit and reported by TheNextWeb , came in the form of an internal document describing the promotion, including Starbucks' upcoming, limited-time Pokémon -themed beverage.\nMost, but not all, Starbucks stores and cafés will become officially designated locations in Pokémon Go beginning this Thursday, either as the game's loot-loaded Pokéstops or its competitive gyms. According to the leaked internal documents, the update will also usher in new characters, though how many or which kinds are not specified. This may also mark the full launch of Go 's \"gen 2\" patch, which could usher in as many as 100 new Pokémon characters, if rumors are to be believed.\nThe game, in kind, will alert players that they can order the new Frappuccino Pokémon Go Blended Creme beverage, which appears to be a Frappuccino loaded with raspberry powder. (No, it's not listed as \"Razz Berry\" powder.) Game players will not receive a discount on this beverage, no matter how many razz berries they have in their inventory, while customers who don't play the game will be allowed to order the drink if they want.\nThe biggest bummer, in my opinion: Starbucks staffers have been instructed NOT to create any signage, inside or outdoors, to let customers know about the promotion. Sorry, but the world would be a better place if Starbucks let its armies of bored, art-school college kids draw chalk-émon sipping on coffee drinks. (Plus, come on, the pun opportunities! Ventisaur! Frappucharmander! And surely some better ones!)\nListing image by YOSHIKAZU TSUNO/AFP/Getty Images",

      "text": "On Wednesday, December 7, investors await quarterly results from Costco ( COST ) and Starbucks' ( SBUX ) annual investor day. Analysts expect Costco to post earnings of $1.20 a share on sales of $28.29 billion. During the same quarter a year ago, the company posted per share earnings of $1.09 a share on revenue of $27.2 billion. Plus, Starbucks is holding its annual investor day. This is particularly important as its long-time CEO Howard Schultz announced last week that he is stepping down in 2017 to be replaced by current Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Other notable earnings include Lululemon Athletica ( LULU ) and Brown Forman ( BF.B ) . On the economic calendar, the JOLTS report is out at 10 a.m. EDT for October, while the weekly EIA Petroleum Status report is released at 10:30 a.m. TheStreet's Scott Gamm reports from Wall Street.",

      "title": "Starbucks promotion leak suggests a big Pokémon GO update scheduled for this week",
      "text": "News \nThe potential for retail partnerships with Niantic's Pokémon GO mobile game is built right into its central hook - players travel to real-world locations to catch monsters and collect items, so why not steer them to participating stores or restaurants for a little synergistic profiteering? Ubiquitous coffee house Starbucks seems to be the first business taking Niantic up on a partnership. Internal documents detailing an upcoming promotion for employees, designated for US stores but leaked by Eurogamer , offers some sweet details for players and coffee fans alike. \nThe documents make specific mention of an update to Pokémon GO scheduled for Thursday, November 8th. That update will designate most of the in-game locations corresponding to US Starbucks stores as either Pokestops (where players check in to receive Pokeballs and other items) or Pokémon gyms (where players fight each other's monsters and claim territory). There doesn't seem to be any criteria for which stores will be stops and gyms and which ones won't, but since Starbucks locations are usually chosen for high foot traffic anyway, it probably won't be a major change for players. \nThe more interesting detail is that the update will bring \"new Pokémon.\" No further information on this point was offered. Currently Pokémon GO players can catch almost all of the original 151 monsters from the first round of Game Boy games released almost 20 years ago, with the exception of a few ultra-rare creatures. The only ones that can't be caught or evolved so far are the original legendries: Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres. Either the new Pokémon is one of these five highly anticipated creatures... or Niantic is going to add monsters from the second-generation games, Pokémon Gold and Silver. (This has been rumored, but not confirmed, for some time.) If the latter turns out to be true, we could be looking at as many as 100 new creatures to find and evolve in augmented reality, to say nothing of potential new features in the game itself. \nWith special events , daily bonuses , and an endless series of tweaks to the core game , Niantic has been slowly winning back players after the initial boom and letdown this summer. Bringing back the tracker in a modified form was a big boon. If they can add a huge new variety of creatures in time for the holidays, or even just a few highly desirable ones to hunt while traveling, it could keep the initial excitement of Pokémon GO alive and kicking well into 2017. \nOh, and one more thing. The Starbucks partnership means that shoppers will have access to an official Pokémon GO Frappuccino, the store's signature smoothie-style coffee drink. The Pokémon variety is made from a cream base with blended ice, vanilla flavoring, freeze-dried blackberries, strawberry syrup, and whipped cream on top. That makes for a drink that's, well, pink. Either Starbucks just couldn't make a yellow Pikachu drink that looked appealing, or someone has decided to make a real life Frappuccino version of the infamous Slowpoke Tail treat from the Gold and Silver games. Even the pink-and-white coloring matches. Oh, the Poke-manity! Source:",

      "text": "Business News | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 9:33pm EST Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars FILE PHOTO: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 18, 2015. REUTERS/David Ryder/File photo By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more toward coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.” \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler) Next In Business News Trump claims $50 billion SoftBank investment due to his election win \nNEW YORK The head of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp , which in October set up a $100 billion fund for technology investments, said on Tuesday he would invest $50 billion in U.S. businesses, a move President-elect Donald Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win.",

      "text": "Entertainment News | Wed Dec 7, 2016 | 8:34am IST Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars FILE PHOTO: Starbucks Chief Executive Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington March 18, 2015. REUTERS/David Ryder/File photo By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.” \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler) Next In Entertainment News",

      "text": "pokemon go leak hints at massive starbucks promotion scheduled for this week plus More Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends\nPokémon Go may have struggled to maintain its initial swell of popularity over the past few months, but at its peak the game was an obsession for millions of amateur trainers. Now, there’s evidence that a major effort to realize the game’s potential as a marketing tool is set to launch later this week.\nLeaked employee memos suggest that international coffee shop chain Starbucks will be hosting a Pokémon Go event starting on December 8. The promotion will apparently center around a new variation on the company’s Frappuccino blended beverage, according to a report from The Next Web .\nDeveloper Niantic, Inc. will apparently turn the majority of company-operated Starbucks locations in the United States into Pokéstops or Gyms ahead of the event. When players visit these locations in-game, they’ll be presented with the opportunity to “unlock” the themed drink — but all customers will have access to the product.\nMore: Pokémon Sun and Moon are Nintendo of America’s fastest-selling games ever\nThe bigger draw for players is the fact that the promotion is rumored to introduce a brand new Pokémon to the game. Alongside the drink, visiting a Starbucks location and swiping its marker will apparently secure access to the new creature, although there are few details about how this process will work.\nIt’s easy to see how a desirable new Pokémon would be the obvious reward for a promotion like this. The initial Pokémon Go craze may have passed, but plenty of players would likely return to the game for curiosity’s sake if one of the often-discussed legendary birds was made available in this way.\nFortunately, we won’t have to wait too long to find out what rewards are available as part of the Pokémon Go -Starbucks cross-promotion. If the event is indeed legitimate, it’s scheduled to get underway this Thursday morning, and will continue as long as supplies of the new Frappuccino mix last.\nData science artist shows 'virality' of 'Pokémon Go' with data visualization Time to upgrade your 3DS SD card: 'Pokémon Sun,' 'Moon' need more than 3GB each 'Pokémon Go' introduces Buddy Pokémon mechanic in latest update",

      "text": "By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger\nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers.\nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world.\nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday.\nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities.\n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.\nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore.\nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York.\nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.\nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand.\n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks.\n\"If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.\"\nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually.\nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks.\nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown.\nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.\n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) Chief Executive Howard Schultz, plans to leave the company in April , and the move, though surprising, should ultimately benefit shareholders .\nA staunch Hillary Clinton supporter in the presidential election last month, his departure comes amid his criticism of President-elect Donald Trump, exposing the second-largest restaurant chain to an uncomfortable relationship with the incoming administration.\nInvestors should use the pullback in shares of Starbucks to buy the stock. The company remains a solid long-term growth opportunity .\nYes, some U.S. companies have become embroiled in a volatile political climate.\nFor example, at a recent conference, PepsiCo Chief Executive Indra Nooyi said that her employees were \"crying \" about the election outcome.\nStarbucks and PepsiCo are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . See how Cramer rates the stocks here . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells SBUX and PEP ? Learn more now .\nMatt Maloney, the founder and chief executive of food delivery service, GrubHub sparked criticism with an email to employees that some said suggested that those who supported Trump resign.\nKellogg pulled its advertising from far-right news website Breitbart, formerly run by Steve Bannon, who Trump named as his chief strategist.\nMeanwhile, Schultz, who some say has political ambitions, said that he was \"stunned\" after Trump won and then said we \"cannot know\" the actual impact on the U.S. and the world.",

Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world.\nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday.\nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities.\n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.\nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore.\n© REUTERS/David Ryder/File photo Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz speaks during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle, Washington The company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York.\nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.\nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand.\n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks.\n\"If I had the money to spend more toward coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.”\nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually.\nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks.\nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown.\nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.\n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.\n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler)\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "monticelllo—Getty Images McDonald's is buying new coffee machines to ramp up its efforts to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. A drip coffee will cost just $1 \nMcDonald’s wants to become the place where you get your daily coffee fix. \nThe fast food chain is reintroducing its coffee shop, the McCafé, in 2017, with improvements like getting beans from sustainable sources, Bloomberg reported . The chain would also require U.S. franchisees to purchase new gear for their espresso machines, with a price tag of $12,000. The updated equipment would have better milk-steaming technology and be able to make a greater variety of drinks. \nThe move would make the restaurant’s offerings competitive with coffee giants like Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts—and McDonald’s plans to tout price as a key advantage over its rivals. Starting in the first quarter of next year, it will offer a $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty-beverage deal. \nThe company is also expanding to cafes: It opened its first stand-alone McCafé in Toronto and sells products like Americanos, espresso shots and pastries that it bakes in-house. \nIt’s not the only step that McDonald’s has taken to compete with Starbucks and Dunkin’ Donuts. This fall, McDonald’s sold pumpkin spice lattes across all its U.S. locations for the first time in three years. \nThe chain is hoping that caffeine might be a way to bring more customers in the door: Though sales at burger chains increased by just 3% last year, coffee café sales spiked by 10%. Though McDonald’s has seen success with the launch of its all-day breakfast menu last year—and is testing new menu items like garlic fries and features like mobile ordering —foot traffic is still on the decline. \n",

      "text": "Business Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars Sandy Roberts pours samples of Starbucks Reserve Sun Dried Ethiopia Yirgacheffe coffee during the company's annual shareholders meeting in Seattle. Photo: Reuters Tweet   \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more toward coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.” \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

      "text": "Bean fiends, night owls, morning slouches: this one’s for you.\nOn Tuesday, Starbucks sbux launched its annual “Starbucks for Life” competition in the U.S. and Canada, which awards seven winners a lifetime supply of the company’s products.\nMembers of Starbucks’ loyalty program, Starbucks Rewards, can earn up to two game plays per day from now until Jan. 16 by making purchases at participating outlets. You can then convert the game plays into “digital game pieces” on the company’s competition website . Winners successfully collect all of the game pieces in a row on the digital game board.\nBesides the grand Starbucks for Life prizes--which are being rolled out for a third year running--entrants in the game of chance can also win a year, month or week’s worth of Starbucks food and beverages.\nNew features this year include in-game challenges that provide customers with additional rewards for making purchases. These include a “Jump the Line” challenge that rewards customers for buying coffee via the mobile app.\nFor more on Starbucks, watch Fortune’s video: \n\nA Starbucks press release clarifies that a lifetime’s supply means winners will only receive credit for one drink or food item per day for a duration of 30 years--which is probably a good thing.",

REUTERS/David Ryder/File Photo More By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. Schultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores.

Starbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday.

Starbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. The company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. Reuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. Twenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio.

      "text": "Pinterest \nA leak from Starbucks in the USA has revealed that Niantic is preparing to release new Pokemon for Pokemon Go. However, there is no indication as to what this means; although that hasn’t stopped people from speculating that this is the expected release of the 100 new Pokemon from the franchise’s second generation. \nLeaked documents were mainly concerned with an upcoming Starbucks promotion that will turn all US stores into Pokestops for the holiday period. Which really isn’t all that important for those of us who live outside the United States of America. \nWhat is important is the indication that more than one Pokemon is being introduced to the game. The internal promo announcement starts with the line “The world of Pokemon Go is about to expand with new Pokemon and a new Starbucks beverage”. The plural use of the word Pokemon probably means that this isn’t the release of Mew. \nOn the other hand, there is speculation that this could be a holiday promotion to release the three Generation I legendary Pokemon birds. It would certainly be the right time of year, with everyone in the mood to get together and celebrate.",

REUTERS/David Ryder/File Photo 1/2 left right Bags of Starbucks small-lot coffee featuring the new 'reserve' logo is on display at a preview of its new Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle, Washington, U.S. on December 4, 2014. REUTERS/Jason Redmond/File Photo 2/2 By Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger | LOS ANGELES/NEW YORK \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labelled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 (7.89 pounds) cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighbourhood. \"I think people want it, too.” \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler) Next In Business News",

      "text": "\nPokemon GO news update reveals as a confidential memo for baristas in Starbucks, the world’s biggest coffee chain have been leaked online.\nFirst appearing on Eurogamer , the marketing material which was supposedly for Starbucks baristas eyes only revealed that the expected 100 new Pokemon to be introduced this December is coming this week.\nThe Starbucks “Barista Need-To-Know” memo states that the coffee chain will soon become Pokestops or Pokemon Gyms after Niantic rolls out a Pokemon Go update on Thursday, December 8.\nWhat do you think of the rumored #starbucks #pokemongo event? Do you think gen 2 is being released? pic.twitter.com/uFSgY7KRQg \n— Pokemon Go OKC (@okcpokemon) December 6, 2016 \n\nStarting on Thursday, Starbucks will be serving a PokĂŠmon Go Frappucino which is basically a regular vanilla Frappucino that has been “evolved with raspberry syrup and blackberries.”\nThe Q&A portion of the document also explains how Starbucks baristas should handle Pokemon Go players who are just in the cafĂŠ to play.\n“Serving our customers is the most important thing we do every day. Make the moment right and use your best judgment to address PokĂŠmon Go players in the cafe.”\nReview of #PokemonGO Frappuccino at #Starbucks : I always imagined this is how pokĂŠberries taste. Sweet and berrirific! pic.twitter.com/jNnQqMCZZj \n— Team Mystic Atlanta (@TeamMysticATL) December 6, 2016 \n\nFurthermore, a Reddit post from alturrisi revealed that the special Pokemon Go Frappuccino is exclusively made for players of the game.\n[PHOTO] MORE evidence from HUGE Starbucks Pokemon GO related event on Dec. 8th! from pokemongo \n\nBut aside from unveiling the blooming partnership between Niantic and Starbucks, the confidential document also revealed exciting Pokemon Go news update on a patch to be rolled out this week.\nApparently, the Pokemon Go update that turns Starbucks stores in the United States into Pokestops or Pokemon Gyms also holds a much more exciting surprise: the second Generation Gold and Silver Pokemon.\nAccording to the Starbacks marketing material, “new Pokemon” will be introduced alongside the “evolved” Frappuccino.\n“The world of Pokemon GO is about to expand with new Pokemon and a new Starbucks beverage!”\nSince the game was launched in June, Pokemon GO updates already introduced almost all of the original 151 characters showcased in the Game Boy game released two decades ago save for a few specially rare ones.\nAccording to the Android Police’s Pokemon GO news , update on the game that was made recently revealed Ditto to the world and will soon be joined by Legendary ones such as Mew, Mewtwo, Articuno, Zapdos, and Moltres if Eurogamer interpreted the Starbucks promotional leak correctly.\nThis also means that Niantic will add more creatures in the augmented reality game including those from second-generation games or the “Gen 2 Pokemon.”\nBut while that is already exciting, December still holds much promise for loyal players of the game as Pokemon Go news cited in a previous report from the Inquisitr reveals the possibility of trading and player-versus-player features to be introduced in the mobile game.\nAlso, an Android Authority’s Pokemon Go news update involving a Sprint-Niantic partnership is set to be unveiled on Wednesday, December 7.\nMeanwhile, official word from Niantic Labs related to Pokemon Go news update reveal that the game has been updated on Tuesday, December 6, into version 0.49.1 for Android and 1.19.1 for iOS.\nAccording to the press release, Pokemon Go players can now transfer multiple characters to Professor Willow’s care at the same time. To do this, players should press and hold on a PokĂŠmon before choosing the “Transfer” function.\nIcons revealing the type of Pokemon that are currently battling in Gyms has also been added both in the battle sequence and Gym approach.\nOther tweaks made on Tuesday’s update include a total Candy count indicator for your Buddy Pokemon’s information screen as well as the total number of kilometers walked by every Pokemon that has been assigned as a Buddy for a time.\nWhat did you think of this Pokemon Go news update?

      "text": "Pokémon Go could get 100 new Pokémon this week 8:17 am \nAccording to a handful of Starbucks employee guides, Pokemon Go is about to get bigger. Though the images have not been verified by Niantic, Nintendo or Starbucks, some Reddit users claim that verified Starbucks employees have vouched for their authenticity. \nThis is big news for fans of the game.“The world of Pokémon Go is about to expand with new Pokémon and a new Starbucks beverage!” the “Barista need-to-know” guide says. The flyers state that Pokémon Go’s second generation will arrive on Thursday, December 8th. \nThat info combined with news from back in November, when curious fans dove into Pokémon Go’s data and found references to 100 creatures from Pokémon Gold and Silver, plus code for the shapeshifting Pokémon, Ditto, all lead us to believe we have a lot of Pokemon on the way. Ditto hit Pokémon Go at the end of November. \nAlso on December 8th, according to the flyers, the majority of Starbucks stores across the United States will become PokéStops or Gyms, and they will also offer a new Pokémon Go-branded Frappuccino. The drink will show up as an icon in Pokémon Go, it seems. These are big steps for Niantic’s game and for players as well.",

      "text": "McDonald''s Plans $12,000 Espresso Machines To Take On Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts  28:  McDonald's Plans $12,000 Espresso Machines To Take On Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts \n(RTTNews.com) - Fast food major McDonald's is investing in $12,000 espresso machines for all of its U.S. restaurants, with a view to challenge Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts in the coffee business, Bloomberg reported. \nAiming to attract more customers, the company plans to reintroduce its coffee shop McCafe in 2017, with upgraded espresso machines, and special deals for customers. The updated equipment would have better milk-steaming technology, and can make a variety of drinks. The company has also promised to buy more sustainably sourced coffee beans. \nWith a view for its offerings to be more competitive with coffee giants like Starbucks and Dunkin' Donuts, the company is also said to highlight its price advantages over its rivals. The company plans to offer $1 drip coffee and $2 small specialty beverages over the first quarter of 2017. \nMcDonald's sells Americanos and shots of espresso in Canada, and even has a stand-alone McCafe in Toronto. \nThe chain's foot traffic is reportedly down, despite its success with the launch of all-day breakfast menu last year. The company is also testing new menu items like garlic fries and features like mobile ordering. \nThe company expects that caffeine would bring more customers. As per the report, sales at burger chains increased by just 3 percent last year, while coffee cafÃ© sales grew by 10 percent. \n ",

      "text": "AT&T deal under scrutiny; Italian bank watch; Starbucks CEO faces investors by Alanna Petroff @AlannaPetroff December 7, 2016: 4:59 AM ET Click chart for in-depth premarket data. 1. Senate hearing on AT&T-Time Warner deal: The CEOs of AT&T ( T , Tech30 ) and Time Warner ( TWX ) are set to defend their $85 billion mega-merger at a congressional hearing scheduled for 10 a.m. ET. \nThe CEOs might also eventually face questions from President-elect Donald Trump, who has said the media merger would concentrate \"power in the hands of too few.\" \nTime Warner is the parent company of CNNMoney. \n2. Italy in wait-and-see mode: Investors are waiting to see if a top Italian bank -- Monte dei Paschi di Siena ( BMDPF ) -- is going to be able to sort out its own finances or be forced to seek a state bailout . \nAn announcement could come as early as Wednesday. \nThe bank is trying to salvage a rescue plan that would see private investors inject €5 billion ($5.4 billion) into the bank. A government bailout is the last resort option, and would cause big losses for shareholders and some bondholders. \nKathleen Brooks, research director at City Index, said the markets are taking the view that \"no news is good news.\" \nThe bank's volatile shares jumped by roughly 10% on Wednesday. But they're still down by more than 80% since the start of 2016. Other European banking stocks are also rallying. \nBefore the Bell newsletter: Key market news. In your inbox. Subscribe now! \n3. Starbucks investor day: Starbucks ( SBUX ) is hosting an event for investors on Wednesday, less than a week after Howard Schultz announced plans to step down as CEO next year. \nWhile the New York event was planned before Schultz's announcement, his departure will likely dominate the day's conversation. \n4. India's rate decision: India's central bank announced Wednesday it's leaving interest rates unchanged at 6.25%. \nThis comes just weeks after the country's shocking decision to scrap its two largest rupee bills. The decision caused about 86% of India's bank notes to become worthless overnight and has drained millions of dollars worth of cash from the economy. \nThe central bank said it expects slower growth as a result of the cash crunch. \n5. Earnings and economics: Costco ( COST ) , H&R Block ( HRB ) and Lululemon ( LULU ) are set to release earnings after the close Wednesday. \nAnd the U.S. Energy Information Administration is reporting weekly crude oil inventory data at 10:30 a.m. Oil prices are currently holding steady at around $51 per barrel. \n6. Global market overview: U.S. stock futures are holding steady as most global markets power higher. \nEuropean markets are making strong gains in early trading. \nAsian markets ended the day in positive territory. \nAustralia's main index also rose 0.9% even as new data showed the economy contracted in the latest quarter, marking the first time the economy shrunk since 2011. \nDownload CNN MoneyStream for up-to-the-minute market data and news \n7. Coming this week: \nWednesday - Senate hearing on AT&T-Time Warner merger; GSA weighs in on Trump's hotel lease; Starbucks Investor Day Thursday - European Central Bank's monetary policy meeting Friday - Government spending measure expires CNNMoney (London)   4:59 AM ET",

      "text": "Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars Updated: December 6, 2016 — 9:28 PM EST Share Reuters \nBy Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK, Dec 6 (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.\" \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.

      "text": "Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars Updated: December 6, 2016 — 9:44 PM EST Share Lisa Baertlein and Tim Baysinger Reuters Mail icon \nLOS ANGELES/NEW YORK (Reuters) - Starbucks Corp co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more toward coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.” \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually. \nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks. \nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown. \nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks. \n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys. \n(Reporting by Lisa Baertlein in Los Angeles and Tim Baysinger in New York; Editing by Peter Henderson and Leslie Adler) More Coverage ",

      "text": "\nThe only difference between a visionary and a lunatic is that, in hindsight, the visionary turned out to be right. \nContinue Reading Below \nWhen a marketing executive returned from a trip to Milan with a crazy idea of opening a national chain of espresso cafes like the ones he saw all over Italy, his bosses said no thanks. So Howard Schultz embarked on his crazy new venture while his former company focused on coffee beans. The result was Starbucks. \nThat was 40 years ago, give or take. I guess we’ve all had plenty of time to figure out whether Schultz was a lunatic or a visionary. Today, Starbucks is one of the most recognized brands in the world, employing more than 250,000 people in 25,000 locations. The company has a market cap of $83 billion. \nLast week, the biggest name in coffee announced that Schultz will be stepping down as chief executive officer to focus on another new venture: a chain of high-end coffee shops designed to boost sales and distinguish the brand from an ever-growing list of competitors, from Tully’s and Peet’s to Dunkin’ Donuts and McDonald’s. \nCurrent president and COO Kevin Johnson – a former Microsoft executive and CEO of Juniper Networks – will take over as CEO while Schultz will take on the new title of executive chairman next spring. \nAll eyes will be on Schultz and Johnson on Wednesday, when the coffee giant will host its 2016 Investor Day. Investors are justifiably nervous about losing the visionary who has kept the company at the forefront of innovation and steered the ship through some pretty rough competitive and economic waters worthy of its namesake, from the pages of Moby Dick. It’s hard to forget what happened the last time the native New Yorker gave up the helm. \nContinue Reading Below ADVERTISEMENT \nIn 2000, Schultz bumped himself up to chairman, ostensibly to focus on global strategy. But with day-to-day operations in the capable hands of long-time company executive Orin Smith, Schultz went off to run a sports franchise, the NBA’s Seattle Supersonics. \nFor five years, that configuration seemed to work remarkably well. Revenues exploded as the number of stores tripled. So did the stock. But Smith retired in 2005, handing the reins to supermarket veteran Jim Donald. Within a couple of years, however, it became apparent that the company had expanded too far and grown too fast. \nIn early 2007, Schultz penned a memo to his CEO decrying what he called “the commoditization of the Starbuck’s experience.” He said the sights, smells and warmth of a neighborhood cafe had been replaced by the sterile, cookie cutter mechanization of a chain. He felt that the company had lost its its soul. That it was growing for growth’s sake. That its leadership had succumbed to hubris. \nThe timing couldn’t have been worse. As the housing bubble burst and the world plunged into economic crisis, what shareholders had come to expect as a recession-proof growth machine began to falter. Same-store sales declined and profits plunged as consumers flocked to lower-cost competitors. In January of 2008, Starbucks fired Donald and brought back its founder. \nThe next two years were brutal. Besides the inevitable cost-cutting and shuttering of thousands of stores, Schultz redesigned the remaining cafes to reinvigorate the customer experience and retrained staff to focus on quality. He took 10,000 managers to hurricane-ravaged New Orleans to do community service, remind them of their values and galvanize the company’s leadership. And he doubled-down on innovation. \nMany pundits and analysts were skeptical of his turnaround efforts. I didn’t think he could pull it off. I also thought that Via instant coffee was a bad idea that would further erode the brand. But having grown up in public housing with working class parents, Schultz was no stranger to adversity. He trusted his intuition and proved us all wrong. \nNow the visionary who first taught us the difference between good and bad coffee is going to try the chairman thing again. Should we give him the benefit of the doubt? I think so, for several reasons. \nFirst, I’m sure Schultz would do just about anything to avoid another experience like the last time he stepped down as CEO. I don’t see him taking his eye off the ball this time. I think the new title of executive chairman speaks to that. \nSecond, the company is again starting to plateau. It makes sense for its chief visionary to get to work on reinvigorating the Starbucks growth engine, as he’s apparently adept at doing. \nLastly, there’s his new strategy of creating a Starbucks Reserve brand of coffee that would sell for as much as $12 a cup. To me, that seems sort of nuts. But every time I’ve second-guessed the guy, I’ve been wrong. I’m not going to make that mistake again. What do you think? ",

      "title": "At Starbucks, CEO Transition Plan Includes Vow Not to Hover",
      "text": "Shutterstock photo\nBy Joann S. Lublin and Julie Jargon\nIt's good to be the boss -- unless the former boss is looking over your shoulder.\nHoward Schultz, who is relinquishing his role as Starbucks Corp.'s chief executive, says he will truly step back from daily decision-making, unlike the last time he gave up the top job 16 years ago.\nInstead of managing the day-to-day business, Mr. Schultz will stay on as chairman and take on a new project to build luxury coffee shops within Starbucks. Investors are expected to get more details Wednesday on the company's plan to open high-end stores serving rare coffees.\nThe transition plan is fairly unusual in corporate America. More typically, a successful exiting CEO remains board chairman for a transition period that lasts no longer than a year.\nThe handover comes at a pivotal moment for the coffee chain. After many years of posting strong same-store sales growth in its key U.S. market, sales have begun to slow. Starbucks has missed sales targets in the U.S. for four straight quarters, which it says is due to economic uncertainty. It may be years before the new high-end stores have an impact on results.\nKeeping the former CEO hanging around in another operational role is more common at tech start-ups than at large, established companies, experts say. It can succeed if the current and former CEO have distinct areas of expertise, said Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, a senior associate dean at Yale School of Management who has written leadership books.\nBut such an arrangement won't work if the company is \"trying to appease\" its former chief, according to George L. Davis Jr., leader of the global CEO practice at executive recruiter Egon Zehnder. Then, \"it usually is a recipe for friction.\"\nPeople who have worked with the 63-year-old Mr. Schultz say he has created a culture in which staffers feel free to disagree with him.\nBut Mr. Schultz, who helped build Starbucks into a global brand, has had a hand in the direction of the business as far back as 1982, when he joined the company as its director of marketing and retail operations.\nOrin Smith, who served as CEO after Mr. Schultz stepped down from running the company in 2000 to focus on opening more stores overseas, said \"we had our share of conflicts\" over issues such as whom to promote and which new countries to enter. But the two executives knew how to collaborate and settled disagreements privately, Mr. Smith said.\nYet, Mr. Schultz also remained highly involved in other major strategic decisions and \"had the last call on all matters,\" Mr. Smith said.\nMr. Smith retired in 2005 and was succeeded by Jim Donald, whom directors fired three years later after the company's sales faltered and traffic at its U.S. stores declined for the first time. Under Mr. Donald, the chain had ventured into selling books, music and movies, which distracted Starbucks from the business of selling coffee.\nIn a 2011 book, Mr. Schultz said his relationship with Mr. Donald became complicated. \"I tried to give him space to do his job by forcing myself to stay out of meetings and keeping some opinions, but not all, to myself,\" Mr. Schultz wrote. He wrote that he had continuing disagreements with Mr. Donald about which people to promote into key roles. Mr. Schultz retook the helm in 2008.\nMr. Donald couldn't be reached for comment.\nMr. Schultz said leaving the CEO post this time will be different. Through a spokesman, he said Mr. Johnson, once he becomes CEO, will have the final call on all company decisions.\nBut pairing a company's visionary with an operations executive doesn't always work out in a CEO handover.\nAt Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc., for example, founder and chairman Martha Stewart was appointed chief creative officer when the company elevated operating chief Lisa Gersh to CEO in July 2012. Less than six months later, Ms. Gersh announced plans to resign. Her tenure had been marked by a difficult relationship with Ms. Stewart, people familiar with the company said at that time.\nMessrs. Schultz and Johnson have a close working relationship and a unique friendship, according to people familiar with the matter. The two men, who are known to finish each other's sentences, work in adjacent offices at Starbucks'sSeattle headquarters and plan to continue doing so.\nAnalysts say Mr. Johnson, a former Microsoft Corp. executive and CEO of Juniper Networks Inc., has the know-how to oversee the chain's 25,000 stores.\nIn an interview last week, Mr. Schultz credited Mr. Johnson as a co-architect of the strategy of moving upscale. Mr. Schultz, who began talking with Mr. Johnson about becoming CEO this spring, said: \"Our skill base couldn't be more complementary.\"\n(END) Dow Jones Newswires 12-07-160714ET Copyright (c) 2016 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.",

      "text": "Don't Miss: How to Find NES Classic at Target Stores \nThere have been rumors for weeks about a promotional event between Starbucks and Pokemon Go, and now Starbucks employees have pretty much confirmed that it is going to happen, according to Forbes . \nThe partnership will turn every Starbucks in the US into a gym or Pokestop, according to leaked documents. This all stems from the fact that at least for a while, there was an uptick in traffic to stores that were near Pokestops or Gyms. There will be a few Starbucks that won't participate, but \"the majority\" will be. \nThere will even be a new drink at Starbucks called the “Pokémon GO Frappuccino,\" which will be a raspberry and blackberry mixture. \nSome people are even speculating that we might see the release of Gen 2 Pokemon in conjunction with the Starbucks promotion, though that has yet to be confirmed by anyone. \nThe only thing that could be a hint is the tagline used: “The world of Pokémon GO is about to expand with new Pokémon and a new Starbucks beverage. \nStill, this is all open to interpretation.",

      "text": "Starbucks Corp. SBUX, -0.10% announced its five-year strategic plan included goals of 10% revenue growth, 15-20% earnings-per-share growth and 12,000 new stores globally by 2021, along with mid-single digit same-store sales growth each year. \"I have never been more energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead,\" said chairman and chief executive officer Howard Schultz, who will become executive chairman in early April of 2017, with Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer, taking over as president and CEO. Starbucks plans to open Reserve Roastery retail locations - a new format of store formed in partnership with Italian foodmaker Princi - starting next year, with the first stores opening in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of 2017, and stores planned for Shanghai, Tokyo and New York City. A new beverage, the Cascara Latte -- made with the fruit of the coffee cherry -- will be introduced in January. New food offerings next year will include new breakfast offerings, more bistro box offerings and organic soups rolled out regionally, with plans to double food growth over the next five years. Starbucks plans to roll out a new Artificial Intelligence ordering system for its app starting in limited beta for iOS in early 2017. The company said it is on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China over the next five years, and said it expects the market to exceed the U.S.'s over time. The company also plans to grow at-home and ready-to-drink products, saying it expects an incremental $1 billion in revenue for the segment, a 75% growth in operating revenue and double the ready-to-drink business outside the U.S. Starbucks shares, which closed on Tuesday at $57.44, dropped 4.3% year-to-date, compared with a 9.1% rise in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.34%",

      "title": "Starbucks courts millennials with $10 coffee at new Reserve bars",
      "text": "Taylor Weidman | Bloomberg | Getty Images An employee pours coffee from a round glass jug into a mug at a Starbucks Corp. on Monday, Oct. 24, 2016. Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz's plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world's largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers. \nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new \"Reserve\" brand stores. Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world. \nStarbucks last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday. \nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities. \n\"Starbucks is the millennials' parents' coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,\" said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America. \nStarbucks' Reserve projects are \"a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,\" said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore. \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York. \nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan's Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 \"flights\" of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu. \nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand. \n\"I'd probably just stick to the regular, I'm not too picky,\" said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks. \n\"If I had the money to spend more toward coffee I'd do it,\" she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. \"I think people want it, too.\" \nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually.\n\nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks.\nStarbucks' 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein's Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz's new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown.\nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.\n\"There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,\" said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.",

      "text": "By: Starbucks Coffee Company via Business Wire News Releases  00 AM EST Starbucks Presents Its Five-Year Plan for Strong Global Growth Fueled by a Robust Pipeline of Innovation at Biennial Investor Conference Starbucks Presents Its Five-Year Plan for Strong Global Growth Fueled by a Robust Pipeline of Innovation at Biennial Investor Conference \nCapping another record quarter, and year of growth and profitability, Starbucks ( NASDAQ: SBUX ) today will host its biennial Investor Conference to present the company’s five-year strategic plan to grow revenue by 10 percent, EPS by 15-20 percent, and drive mid-single digit comp growth each year, as it plans to open approximately 12,000 new stores globally by 2021 while continuing to elevate the Starbucks Experience around the world. 1 \n“Industry-leading innovation is driving our core business and creating further separation from competitors all around the world,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve stores will further transform – and elevate – the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers, and are laying the foundation for our next wave of profitable, global growth. I have never been more energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead as Kevin transitions to the ceo role and leads the most talented and experienced leadership team in Starbucks history.” \n“Starbucks continues to deliver record financial performance. The customer experience created in our stores by partners who proudly wear the green apron is what makes Starbucks a destination for 80 to 90 million customers a week,” said Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer. “We are today executing against an ambitious, carefully-curated, multi-year strategy to further elevate the entire Starbucks brand and customer experience around the world, and further extending Starbucks leadership around all things coffee, retail and mobile. The power of our brand, the strength and momentum in our business, and the world-class management talent we have assembled give me great confidence in our ability to capture the enormous global growth opportunities ahead.” \nLast week, it was announced that Johnson will assume the role of president and ceo at Starbucks, and Schultz will become executive chairman, effective April 3, 2017. \n1 Revenue and EPS growth are based on non-GAAP FY16 results. A reconciliation of FY16 GAAP revenue and EPS to non-GAAP revenue and EPS can be found at the end of this press release. \nTransforming the Premium Coffee Experience \nSince opening two years ago, the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Seattle has become recognized as the most dynamic and immersive coffee forward retail experience in the world, delivering an unprecedented level of premiumization to the coffee category and fueling the next wave of transformation that is elevating the Starbucks Experience globally. Building on this, the company plans to accelerate the presentation of the Roastery experience around the world, opening its next Roastery in Shanghai in 2017, Tokyo and New York City in 2018, and a fifth location in Europe to be announced early next year. \nEach Roastery will serve as the foundation for Starbucks Reserve® stores – a new retail format that will integrate the theatre and romance of the Roastery with the unique culinary experience of the company’s new Italian food partner, Princi. These Starbucks Reserve® stores, under the leadership of the company’s new Siren Retail organization, represent a significant growth opportunity for the company in the U.S. and around the world. The first of these new stores will open in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of FY17, with plans to open 1,000 or more globally over time. In addition, the company plans to open standalone Princi stores in Seattle, New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early 2018. The company is also extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to its core Starbucks® stores, adding Starbucks Reserve® experience bars in up to 20 percent of its total portfolio (including new and renovated locations) by 2021. \nPremiumization Strategy to Drive Innovative New Customer Experiences \nStarbucks Reserve® Roasteries will serve as an innovation pipeline that will elevate the brand and contribute a \"halo\" to the entire Starbucks Experience . This includes new product breakthroughs that will contribute to the growth of the company’s ecosystem, segmented strategically across all Starbucks® stores. Earlier this year, Starbucks introduced its first limited-time beverage offering inspired by the Roastery, the Smoked Butterscotch Latte. This was followed by Nitro Cold Brew, which is now available in more than 500 U.S. company-owned locations and select stores in Canada and China, as Starbucks pursues a $600 million global Cold Brew opportunity. Both products continue to reinforce the company’s focus on Roastery-inspired craft at scale, as well as ongoing investment in the cold coffee category. In core stores, Starbucks innovative, coffee-forward beverages such as Flat White, Cold Brew, Latte Macchiato and Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato all support the company's premiumization strategy. In January, customers nationwide will be introduced to another Roastery offering with the introduction of the Cascara Latte. Made with the fruit of the coffee cherry, Cascara lends subtle notes of dark brown sugar and maple to classic Starbucks® espresso. With its strong retail foundation and operational excellence, Starbucks is bringing Roastery-inspired innovations like this to market more rapidly than ever before, creating further distinction from competitors. \nStarbucks is simultaneously innovating and expanding its food menu with products customers have been looking for, starting with the launch of Sous Vide Egg Bites in January 2017 – a wheat-free, low calorie, high protein, convenient breakfast; the spring launch of a Certified Gluten-Free Breakfast Sandwich; the expansion of the successful Bistro Box platform; as well as a regional rollout of delicious organic soups. Relevant innovation has become fundamental to unlocking the lunch daypart and building on existing breakfast daypart momentum, giving the company the ability to realize additional profitability and incremental sales. Starbucks® Breakfast Sandwich sales have more than doubled over the past four years and innovation will continue to drive meaningful growth, creating and meeting customer demand for innovation across all dayparts. Building on this strong momentum, Starbucks once again aims to double food growth over the next five years. \nExtending the Digital Flywheel \nStarbucks offers the largest and most robust mobile ecosystem of any retailer in the world, with more than 12 million Starbucks Rewards™ members (up 18 percent year on year), eight million mobile paying customers with one out of three now using Mobile Order & Pay, and more than $6 billion loaded onto prepaid Starbucks Cards in North America during the past year alone. Today, Starbucks will unveil an innovative conversational ordering system, My Starbucks® Barista, powered by groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the Starbucks® Mobile App. Starbucks® Mobile App customers will be able to place their orders via voice command or messaging interface, delivering unparalleled speed and convenience, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement and further extending the accessibility of the Starbucks® app. The My Starbucks® Barista feature will roll out first on iOS in limited beta in early 2017 and be made available to more iOS and Android users in subsequent releases. \nStarbucks digital flywheel has also continued to gain momentum with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still early in the evolution of this service, Starbucks hyper-personalized e-mail reward offerings – with more than 400,000 variations – have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns, translating into increased customer engagement and, importantly, accelerated spend. Starbucks has delivered personalized offers to customers directly on the front screen of the mobile app. By early 2017, the company expects to complete the rollout of suggested selling and recommendations (suggesting items for pairing or additions to a customer’s order) during Mobile Order and Pay checkout, which the company believes will further fuel engagement and growth. With Starbucks Rewards™, the company’s new spend-based loyalty program, customers are finding increased value when being rewarded for bigger purchases. This enables the company to boost ticket, create greater marketing flexibility and pursue “Stars Everywhere” partnerships to create further Star earning opportunities, while reducing “order splitting.” With a 94 percent program retention rate, and new international markets on the horizon, the program is stronger than ever before. \nUnlocking High-Value Opportunities in China \nCustomers in China have continued to embrace the Starbucks brand, with some of the company’s most innovative, efficient and profitable stores producing record revenue and strong same-store sales growth in FY16. Starbucks newest class of stores in China are delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in the company’s 17-year history in the market. Starbucks now operates approximately 2,500 stores in 118 cities in China and employs more than 30,000 partners (employees), opening over a store a day – a growth rate that will continue to accelerate well into the future. Starbucks remains on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China by 2021 and expects the market will eclipse that in the U.S. over time. While Starbucks business in China is in its very early stages of development, the company will announce today a series of strategic moves it is making in the digital and mobile space to further extend customer engagement and loyalty. \nExpanding Global Leadership Position in At-Home Coffee and Ready-to-Drink \nOver the next five years, Starbucks expects its Channel Development segment, which includes its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) portfolio, Branded Solutions (licensed stores and foodservice), and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) segments, will generate an incremental $1 billion in revenue, grow operating income by 75 percent, and double its RTD business outside of the U.S. The company is the industry leader in premium single serve, premium packaged roast and ground coffee, and Ready-to-Drink products, and is well positioned to grow its share of these markets both in the U.S. and globally. The company's more than 20-year partnership with PepsiCo to create the North America Coffee Partnership (NACP) is a more than $2 billion business and has approximately 97 percent share of the RTD coffee category. The NACP continues to bring to the market highly relevant, new and innovative coffee and energy products to meet the needs of customers looking for premium, on-the-go coffee offerings. In spring 2017, the company will launch new bottled Starbucks® Cold Brew Cocoa and Honey with Cream in select markets across the U.S. In Latin America, Starbucks has expanded its partnership with PepsiCo to begin distribution of the iconic bottled Frappuccino® chilled coffee beverage across ten markets. In China, where the RTD coffee and energy category represents a $6 billion opportunity that is projected to grow by 20 percent over the next three years, Starbucks and its partner, Tingyi Holding Corp., have rapidly achieved distribution in over 37 major Chinese cities and over 7,100 points of distribution, experiencing strong consumer demand. \nStarbucks is extending this same disciplined growth and innovation to the RTD tea category, which is a fast growing $4 billion category, starting with the upcoming launch of bottled Teavana® Craft Iced Teas in partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The first line of teas will begin shipping to select Northeast U.S. retailers in February and customers will soon enjoy four new, vibrant varieties brewed from the finest Teavana® teas and botanicals with no artificial flavors. The new RTD teas include Pineapple Berry Blue Herbal Tea, Peach Green Tea, Mango Black Tea and Passion Tango® Herbal Tea. Later in 2017, select flavors will roll out to Starbucks® stores with plans for national channel availability by 2018. \nCreating Long-Term Opportunities for Partners \nFrom being among the first to offer comprehensive health benefits and equity in the form of stock for partners who work 20 hours or more a week, to providing them with the opportunity for full tuition reimbursement for a bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University through the innovative Starbucks College Achievement Plan, Starbucks has continued to invest in and innovate around the partner experience while balancing the needs of its customers, shareholders and the marketplace. Starbucks has now matched $78 million in 401K savings in the U.S. with a total fund balance of $1.3 billion as of FY16. Its Global Bean Stock program, which grants partners equity in the form of company stock, generated $221.6 million in pre-taxed gains in FY16. The company also recently announced it will add an enhancement to the program in 2017, doubling the annual Bean Stock award for U.S. hourly store partners with at least two years of continuous service with the company. Further, with the recent move to a new healthcare platform, U.S. partners are now saving an average of 15 percent per pay check on healthcare premiums compared to last year. \nStarbucks is finding that these incremental investments in both wages and benefits have helped support and elevate its partners, attract and retain the best talent, provide measured improvement in service to customers and deliver outsized returns to shareholders. In fact, since announcing the Starbucks College Achievement Plan two years ago, the company has enrolled more than 6,300 U.S. partners in the program and is on track to celebrate 1,000 graduates in 2017, with a commitment to graduating 25,000 partners from the program by 2025. Early results from the program are showing that participants have twice the retention rate and are more than four times more likely to achieve a promotion in responsibility. \nIn the spirit of the company’s Mission and Values, Starbucks CUP (Caring Unites Partners) Fund, an emergency financial assistance program for partners impacted by natural disasters and family emergencies, generated over $2.1 million in contributions from partners in FY16 through a combination of “round up” in stores and payroll contributions. Since it launched in 1998, partners have raised more than $18 million toward the CUP Fund. The company also matched $784,000 in individual partner charitable donations and volunteer hours, and donated more than 300,000 meals since launching its FoodShare initiative in select U.S. markets in March 2016. Looking ahead, Starbucks plans to roll out FoodShare to all 8,000+ U.S. company-operated stores over the next three years. \nLive Webcast Details \nStarbucks Investor Day 2016 will be live-streamed exclusively on Yahoo Finance at http://finance.yahoo.com/live/starbucks , and simultaneously available at http://investor.starbucks.com . The event is scheduled to begin at 8:00 a.m. ET and will continue until approximately 12 noon ET.

      "text": "NEW YORK- Capping another record quarter, and year of growth and profitability, Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) today will host its biennial Investor Conference to present the company’s five-year strategic plan to grow revenue by 10 percent, EPS by 15-20 percent, and drive mid-single digit comp growth each year, as it plans to open approximately 12,000 new stores globally by 2021 while continuing to elevate the Starbucks Experience around the world. 1\n“Industry-leading innovation is driving our core business and creating further separation from competitors all around the world,” said Howard Schultz, chairman and chief executive officer. “Our Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve stores will further transform – and elevate – the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers, and are laying the foundation for our next wave of profitable, global growth. I have never been more energized or optimistic about the opportunities ahead as Kevin transitions to the ceo role and leads the most talented and experienced leadership team in Starbucks history.”\n“Starbucks continues to deliver record financial performance. The customer experience created in our stores by partners who proudly wear the green apron is what makes Starbucks a destination for 80 to 90 million customers a week,” said Kevin Johnson, president and chief operating officer. “We are today executing against an ambitious, carefully-curated, multi-year strategy to further elevate the entire Starbucks brand and customer experience around the world, and further extending Starbucks leadership around all things coffee, retail and mobile. The power of our brand, the strength and momentum in our business, and the world-class management talent we have assembled give me great confidence in our ability to capture the enormous global growth opportunities ahead.”\nLast week, it was announced that Johnson will assume the role of president and ceo at Starbucks, and Schultz will become executive chairman, effective April 3, 2017.\n1 Revenue and EPS growth are based on non-GAAP FY16 results. A reconciliation of FY16 GAAP revenue and EPS to non-GAAP revenue and EPS can be found at the end of this press release.\nTransforming the Premium Coffee Experience\nSince opening two years ago, the Starbucks Reserve® Roastery in Seattle has become recognized as the most dynamic and immersive coffee forward retail experience in the world, delivering an unprecedented level of premiumization to the coffee category and fueling the next wave of transformation that is elevating the Starbucks Experience globally. Building on this, the company plans to accelerate the presentation of the Roastery experience around the world, opening its next Roastery in Shanghai in 2017, Tokyo and New York City in 2018, and a fifth location in Europe to be announced early next year.\nEach Roastery will serve as the foundation for Starbucks Reserve® stores – a new retail format that will integrate the theatre and romance of the Roastery with the unique culinary experience of the company’s new Italian food partner, Princi. These Starbucks Reserve® stores, under the leadership of the company’s new Siren Retail organization, represent a significant growth opportunity for the company in the U.S. and around the world. The first of these new stores will open in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of FY17, with plans to open 1,000 or more globally over time. In addition, the company plans to open standalone Princi stores in Seattle, New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early 2018. The company is also extending elements of the high-end Roastery experience to its core Starbucks® stores, adding Starbucks Reserve® experience bars in up to 20 percent of its total portfolio (including new and renovated locations) by 2021.\nPremiumization Strategy to Drive Innovative New Customer Experiences\nStarbucks Reserve® Roasteries will serve as an innovation pipeline that will elevate the brand and contribute a \"halo\" to the entire Starbucks Experience . This includes new product breakthroughs that will contribute to the growth of the company’s ecosystem, segmented strategically across all Starbucks® stores. Earlier this year, Starbucks introduced its first limited-time beverage offering inspired by the Roastery, the Smoked Butterscotch Latte. This was followed by Nitro Cold Brew, which is now available in more than 500 U.S. company-owned locations and select stores in Canada and China, as Starbucks pursues a $600 million global Cold Brew opportunity. Both products continue to reinforce the company’s focus on Roastery-inspired craft at scale, as well as ongoing investment in the cold coffee category. In core stores, Starbucks innovative, coffee-forward beverages such as Flat White, Cold Brew, Latte Macchiato and Iced Coconut Milk Mocha Macchiato all support the company's premiumization strategy. In January, customers nationwide will be introduced to another Roastery offering with the introduction of the Cascara Latte. Made with the fruit of the coffee cherry, Cascara lends subtle notes of dark brown sugar and maple to classic Starbucks® espresso. With its strong retail foundation and operational excellence, Starbucks is bringing Roastery-inspired innovations like this to market more rapidly than ever before, creating further distinction from competitors.\nStarbucks is simultaneously innovating and expanding its food menu with products customers have been looking for, starting with the launch of Sous Vide Egg Bites in January 2017 – a wheat-free, low calorie, high protein, convenient breakfast; the spring launch of a Certified Gluten-Free Breakfast Sandwich; the expansion of the successful Bistro Box platform; as well as a regional rollout of delicious organic soups. Relevant innovation has become fundamental to unlocking the lunch daypart and building on existing breakfast daypart momentum, giving the company the ability to realize additional profitability and incremental sales. Starbucks® Breakfast Sandwich sales have more than doubled over the past four years and innovation will continue to drive meaningful growth, creating and meeting customer demand for innovation across all dayparts. Building on this strong momentum, Starbucks once again aims to double food growth over the next five years.\nExtending the Digital Flywheel\nStarbucks offers the largest and most robust mobile ecosystem of any retailer in the world, with more than 12 million Starbucks Rewards™ members (up 18 percent year on year), eight million mobile paying customers with one out of three now using Mobile Order & Pay, and more than $6 billion loaded onto prepaid Starbucks Cards in North America during the past year alone. Today, Starbucks will unveil an innovative conversational ordering system, My Starbucks® Barista, powered by groundbreaking Artificial Intelligence (AI) for the Starbucks® Mobile App. Starbucks® Mobile App customers will be able to place their orders via voice command or messaging interface, delivering unparalleled speed and convenience, enhancing customer loyalty and engagement and further extending the accessibility of the Starbucks® app. The My Starbucks® Barista feature will roll out first on iOS in limited beta in early 2017 and be made available to more iOS and Android users in subsequent releases.\nStarbucks digital flywheel has also continued to gain momentum with the launch of true one-to-one personalization. While still early in the evolution of this service, Starbucks hyper-personalized e-mail reward offerings – with more than 400,000 variations – have more than doubled customer response rates over previous segmented email campaigns, translating into increased customer engagement and, importantly, accelerated spend. Starbucks has delivered personalized offers to customers directly on the front screen of the mobile app. By early 2017, the company expects to complete the rollout of suggested selling and recommendations (suggesting items for pairing or additions to a customer’s order) during Mobile Order and Pay checkout, which the company believes will further fuel engagement and growth. With Starbucks Rewards™, the company’s new spend-based loyalty program, customers are finding increased value when being rewarded for bigger purchases. This enables the company to boost ticket, create greater marketing flexibility and pursue “Stars Everywhere” partnerships to create further Star earning opportunities, while reducing “order splitting.” With a 94 percent program retention rate, and new international markets on the horizon, the program is stronger than ever before.\nUnlocking High-Value Opportunities in China\nCustomers in China have continued to embrace the Starbucks brand, with some of the company’s most innovative, efficient and profitable stores producing record revenue and strong same-store sales growth in FY16. Starbucks newest class of stores in China are delivering the highest AUVs, ROI and profitability of any store class in the company’s 17-year history in the market. Starbucks now operates approximately 2,500 stores in 118 cities in China and employs more than 30,000 partners (employees), opening over a store a day – a growth rate that will continue to accelerate well into the future. Starbucks remains on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China by 2021 and expects the market will eclipse that in the U.S. over time. While Starbucks business in China is in its very early stages of development, the company will announce today a series of strategic moves it is making in the digital and mobile space to further extend customer engagement and loyalty.\nExpanding Global Leadership Position in At-Home Coffee and Ready-to-Drink\nOver the next five years, Starbucks expects its Channel Development segment, which includes its Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) portfolio, Branded Solutions (licensed stores and foodservice), and Ready-to-Drink (RTD) segments, will generate an incremental $1 billion in revenue, grow operating income by 75 percent, and double its RTD business outside of the U.S. The company is the industry leader in premium single serve, premium packaged roast and ground coffee, and Ready-to-Drink products, and is well positioned to grow its share of these markets both in the U.S. and globally. The company's more than 20-year partnership with PepsiCo to create the North America Coffee Partnership (NACP) is a more than $2 billion business and has approximately 97 percent share of the RTD coffee category. The NACP continues to bring to the market highly relevant, new and innovative coffee and energy products to meet the needs of customers looking for premium, on-the-go coffee offerings. In spring 2017, the company will launch new bottled Starbucks® Cold Brew Cocoa and Honey with Cream in select markets across the U.S. In Latin America, Starbucks has expanded its partnership with PepsiCo to begin distribution of the iconic bottled Frappuccino® chilled coffee beverage across ten markets. In China, where the RTD coffee and energy category represents a $6 billion opportunity that is projected to grow by 20 percent over the next three years, Starbucks and its partner, Tingyi Holding Corp., have rapidly achieved distribution in over 37 major Chinese cities and over 7,100 points of distribution, experiencing strong consumer demand.\nStarbucks is extending this same disciplined growth and innovation to the RTD tea category, which is a fast growing $4 billion category, starting with the upcoming launch of bottled Teavana® Craft Iced Teas in partnership with Anheuser-Busch. The first line of teas will begin shipping to select Northeast U.S. retailers in February and customers will soon enjoy four new, vibrant varieties brewed from the finest Teavana® teas and botanicals with no artificial flavors. The new RTD teas include Pineapple Berry Blue Herbal Tea, Peach Green Tea, Mango Black Tea and Passion Tango® Herbal Tea. Later in 2017, select flavors will roll out to Starbucks® stores with plans for national channel availability by 2018.\nCreating Long-Term Opportunities for Partners\nFrom being among the first to offer comprehensive health benefits and equity in the form of stock for partners who work 20 hours or more a week, to providing them with the opportunity for full tuition reimbursement for a bachelor’s degree from Arizona State University through the innovative Starbucks College Achievement Plan, Starbucks has continued to invest in and innovate around the partner experience while balancing the needs of its customers, shareholders and the marketplace. Starbucks has now matched $78 million in 401K savings in the U.S. with a total fund balance of $1.3 billion as of FY16. Its Global Bean Stock program, which grants partners equity in the form of company stock, generated $221.6 million in pre-taxed gains in FY16. The company also recently announced it will add an enhancement to the program in 2017, doubling the annual Bean Stock award for U.S. hourly store partners with at least two years of continuous service with the company. Further, with the recent move to a new healthcare platform, U.S. partners are now saving an average of 15 percent per pay check on healthcare premiums compared to last year.\nStarbucks is finding that these incremental investments in both wages and benefits have helped support and elevate its partners, attract and retain the best talent, provide measured improvement in service to customers and deliver outsized returns to shareholders. In fact, since announcing the Starbucks College Achievement Plan two years ago, the company has enrolled more than 6,300 U.S. partners in the program and is on track to celebrate 1,000 graduates in 2017, with a commitment to graduating 25,000 partners from the program by 2025. Early results from the program are showing that participants have twice the retention rate and are more than four times more likely to achieve a promotion in responsibility.\nIn the spirit of the company’s Mission and Values, Starbucks CUP (Caring Unites Partners) Fund, an emergency financial assistance program for partners impacted by natural disasters and family emergencies, generated over $2.1 million in contributions from partners in FY16 through a combination of “round up” in stores and payroll contributions. Since it launched in 1998, partners have raised more than $18 million toward the CUP Fund. The company also matched $784,000 in individual partner charitable donations and volunteer hours, and donated more than 300,000 meals since launching its FoodShare initiative in select U.S. markets in March 2016. Looking ahead, Starbucks plans to roll out FoodShare to all 8,000+ U.S. company-operated stores over the next three years.\nLive Webcast Details\nStarbucks Investor Day 2016 will be live-streamed exclusively on Yahoo Finance at http://finance.yahoo.com/live/starbucks , and simultaneously available at http://investor.starbucks.com .

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) the baker? Yep.\nThe coffee king said Wednesday that it will open stand-alone Princi stores in Seattle, New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early 2018.\nIn July, Starbucks made an unspecified investment in the Italian artisan bakery. Princi is expected to become the exclusive food offering at all Starbucks Roastery locations, which are the company's giant new upscale coffeehouses being positioned in major metro areas such as New York City .\nFollow TheStreet's live blog here .\nThe partnership means Starbucks will have a bakery on site at select stores for the first time in its 45-year history. In light of the deal, it appears the new Starbucks actually has a feel of a Panera Bread ( PNRA ) .\nStarbucks and Panera Bread are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .
