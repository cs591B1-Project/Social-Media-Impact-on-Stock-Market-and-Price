      "text": "TWEET If there has been one major complaint regarding Netflix's service, it is that the streaming giant has not allowed users to download shows and movies for future viewing, a feature that is available on Amazon Prime. This, of course, means no watching Breaking Bad on the plane (without paying for internet access) and no binging Stranger Things when the power goes out (a terrifying endeavor, anyway). Well, Netflix has heard your complaints and has just announced that for no extra fee, users of the streaming service will be able to download select programs, starting immediately. Here's how to download Netflix titles for watching offline. For those that are looking to start downloading on Netflix immediately, make sure that you have updated to the most recent version of the streaming app. Once your app is updated, \"available for download\" should become an option. So, go update the Netflix app on iOS and Android, and download away. Binging just got a whole lot easier. Check out some images below. A \"Download & Go\" window appears after you update the Netflix app. ",

      "text": "TWEET President Barack Obama, set to leave the Oval Office in about two months, is known as the United States' first black president. To some, however, it is Obama's mixed-race identity that resonates most. This is the case for Devon Terrell, a 24-year-old Australian actor, who is portraying Obama in the Netflix biopic Barry . The film follows the journey of a young Obama — the son of a white mother and a Kenyan father — who is searching for his place in America as a Columbia University student in New York City at a time when racial tensions were intensifying in the early '80s. In an interview with Mashable , T errell said that while preparing for his role, playing young Obama has helped him accept his mixed-race identity as someone of Anglo-Indian and African-American descent in a country where he still feels like an outsider. Like Obama, who moved to Indonesia with his mother at a young age, Terrell moved to Australia when he was 5. \"I was the only one of my kind, so I knew what it felt like to be an outsider and to try to fit into different circles,\" Terrell told Mashable . \"I'm still a very young man as well, so I'm asking the same questions as Barack.\" \nmy man devon terrell ",

EST December 02, 2016 In this photo illustration the Netflix logo is seen on September 19, 2014 in Paris, France. Netflix September 15 launched service in France, the first of six European countries planned in the coming months. (Photo: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) \nTALLAHASSEE -- Governor Rick Scott has the perfect solution for streamers who want to \"Netflix and chill\" without paying local taxes. \nMove on down to Florida. \nScott went on Twitter Thursday to encourage people to resist the ongoing trend of local and state governments considering tax hikes on streaming media . Pasadena, California is pondering a 9.4 percent tax. While Chicago already has a 9 percent tax, which has users hopping mad and suing the city. Absurd that cities/ states across the country are passing taxes on subscription streaming services like @Netflix . — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) December 1, 2016 \nScott said it is \"absurd\" that taxes on Neflix exist. He then followed that the Sunshine State welcomes all who want to stream tax-free. To everyone who wants to enjoy streaming services like @Netflix without additional taxes, we look forward to welcoming you to FL! — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) December 1, 2016 \n(© 2016 WTSP)",

      "text": "With so much hype and anticipation, everyone is wondering if the Gilmore Girls revival was a Netflix success.\nNetflix rarely every gives out exact numbers for their ratings, but a Silicon Valley company called Symphony Advanced Media did.\nThe Wrap reports that Gilmore Girls was Netflix’s THIRD biggest hit.\nThe revival drew in 4.971 million viewers in the 18-49 demographic.\nThis means, it beat out Marvel’s Luke Cage , which only drew 3.387 million.\nHowever, it didn’t even come close to Netflix’s cash baby FULLER HOUSE , which had a whopping 7.330 million viewers. ( The second season drops on Dec. 9th )\nThe return to Stars Hollow is impressive however and some think, it could even surpass the last season of Orange Is The New Black , which reported 5. 842 million viewers.\nAll in all, good job Rory and Lorelai!\nRead more about how they got the numbers HERE! \n \n",

      "text": "Arguably every Gilmore Girls fan has seen the Netflix revival A Year in the Life since its release on Nov. 25, but there’s one important person that still hasn’t watched the beloved Stars Hollow residents reunite: Lauren Graham !\nThe actress that brings Lorelai Gilmore to life admitted in a 92nd Street Y talk with Michael Ausiello on Thursday night that she’s successfully avoided seeing the revival so far — and doesn’t have plans to watch it any time soon.\nAfter revealing that she finally watched the original seven series run by locking herself up in her apartment and binge watching for three days after filming the new four-part episodes, the actress admitted that she never watches herself on-screen because she doesn’t gain anything from it. “There are many actors who learn a lot by watching themselves. I’m not one of those people, so I stayed away from it,” Graham said.\nAnd when Ausiello asked if she had seen the revival, she gave a similar answer: “I don’t learn anything and this has the added level of … I was so on another plane, it felt like, during the doing of the thing and I had some of my favorite moments I’ve ever had as an actor and as a person in that experience. I just want to leave it there for now — that was enough. That was more than enough. It was the best experience I’ve ever had.”\nShe went on to admit that she doesn’t know if she’ll ever watch it and credited it as the most professional and emotionally fulfilling experience of her life.\nAnother thing she put off? Reading the full script for “Fall:” the last episode in the revival series where she has a few big emotional moments.\n“I couldn’t read ‘Fall’, I just couldn’t read it,” the actress admitted. “I even think — and I’m sorry — I shot a couple scenes without having read the whole thing. I was on this crazy high and feeling so thankful and so pleased with what the material was, I almost didn’t want to know how it ended. I was worried where it was going and what if I’m disappointed. But finally I had to do it, ’cause I really had to film it, and I sat at the kitchen table and I cried from page one all the way to the end. It was the biggest emotional experience.”\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming now on Netflix.",

      "text": "\nOnce set to be a wide release this past summer from Universal, they handed over the supernatural war film Spectral to Netflix, who will drop it next week. Not one for extensive marketing campaigns, the company has now released the first trailer for the film which follows a group of soldiers who are defending a city from an otherworldly force.\nWhile its different elements look familiar, seeing sci-fi mashed up with a Black Hawk Down -esque scenario may prove to be entertaining. Add in the talents of James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer , and Bruce Greenwood , and maybe this can be a respite from the fairly lackluster year of action cinema.\nDirecting by Nic Mathieu and also starring Max Martini, Clayne Crawford, Cory Hardict, Louis Ozawa Changchien, Jimmy Akingbola, Dylan Smith, Philip Bulcock, Royce Pierreson, Ursula Parker , and Mark O’Neal , check out the trailer below ahead of next week’s release.\n\nSpectral hits Netflix on December 9th .\n",

      "title": "Controversial Opinion: The 'Gilmore Girls' Should Only Come Back If Rory Doesn't",
      "text": "by Sydney Gore Photo courtesy of Netflix \nA week has now passed since the long-awaited, highly anticipated premiere of Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life. When the original series ended in 2007, I felt like a part of me was gone. Where would I go to get all the mother-daughter advice that wasn't normally a part of my life? For the next nine years, I watched and rewatched the series on DVD box sets. When it was eventually added to Netflix's roster, I really felt like the fate of Gilmore Girls was sealed; there would be no more episodes. But then came rumors of a revival. Gilmore Girls star Lauren Graham kept being asked about it in interviews, and, seemingly before I knew it, the cast was back in production. \nLeading up to its premiere, I committed to watching the entire series again. Not even halfway through the first season, it dawned on me how dreadful Rory Gilmore is. Seriously, she's one of the most terrible characters in television history. How had I not noticed this before? I was disturbed by how naive I had been all these years. I guess I had been so thrilled to see smart girls in the spotlight on television for once that I turned a blind eye to just what type of smart girl Rory really was. In the original series, all Rory ever seems to do is boss people around, whine when things don't get done the way she wants them to, and pout when things fall apart. \nThe further I advanced in my rewatch, the more my dislike for Rory increased. She's the epitome of white privilege, a spoiled brat who never really worked hard for anything unless pushed out of her comfort zone. (Usually by her nemesis-turned-friend Paris, for whom I have far more respect. At least Paris knew what she wanted and went after it with every fiber of her being.) So when the revival finally arrived, I assumed that it wouldn't be possible to dislike Rory any more than I already did. In fact, I had hoped that she'd redeem herself in A Year in the Life. Spoiler alert: That didn't happen. \nFor as long as we have known Rory, she has always been fixated on being a part of the elite. Rory's interest in getting to the top—whether that means only attending an Ivy League school or only working for the most prestigious publications—triumphs over everything else. Ironically, though, Rory doesn't have much of a self-determined drive to succeed. When she actually does go after things, it's only because competition pushed her to do so, like when she was in the high-pressure environment of her prep school. These types of environments didn't necessarily make Rory a better person, but at least they shook up her special snowflake mentality. The problem in the revival is that there's nobody there forcing Rory to be better. \nI must admit that there were a few highlights in the revival, though. Watching the relationship between Lorelai and her mother Emily become repaired following the death of Richard, the family patriarch, had me in tears, and I thoroughly enjoyed the transition of Emily moving on with her broken life as a widow. It was made all the more poignant with the knowledge that this plotline was necessary due to the death of actor Edward Herrmann, but I think that Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino handled it beautifully. (Side note: I find it hard to believe that Richard didn't leave Rory a huge sum of money in his will since she was the light of his life, but whatever.) \nThe strength of Gilmore Girls is that it always focused on the relationship between Rory and Lorelai, but the revival makes clearer than ever that we really only have a deep understanding of one of them. It makes sense that Lorelai has commitment issues with men and is overprotective of Rory because of Lorelai's own negative upbringing and subsequent unplanned motherhood as a teenager. Viewers may not always agree with Lorelai's behavior, but we understand it. She's complicated, but we can still have empathy for her, not least because of all the obvious sacrifices she made on behalf of her daughter. \nAs for Rory, there is no understandable explanation for any of her behavior. It's true that we have watched her grow up over the seasons, yet she hasn't seemed to mature. Rory has grown up into the kind of person who knowingly strings along a man, Paul, who she doesn't seem to care for at all for two whole years. Thankfully, Paul finally decides to dump Rory in a text message. The fallout from this is revealing: Rory admits that she's a sucky person for treating him so horribly, but Lorelai immediately shifts the blame from Rory and says that Paul just hasn't found the right girl yet. It's a classic example of Lorelai enabling Rory's bad behavior, and it reveals a lot about their relationship—and little of it is good. \nEveryone is always in denial when Rory does something they disapprove of and ignores her bad behavior because they all hold her up on this pedestal. Rory is supposed to be a success story, a representation of Stars Hollows' cream of the crop. Part of me wants to believe that this is the root of Rory's issues, and perhaps it's an insecurity that has yet to be dissected on screen. It's one thing to lose a job or feel like you haven't found the right one, but to not have secured at least one full-time job out of pure laziness is unacceptable. The fact that she freelanced a few pieces is great, but she doesn't have the hustle in her that is necessary to make a career in journalism. ( Take it from four real-life journos. ) \nI'm sure that many fans are probably disappointed by the ending of A Year In The Life when Rory announces she's pregnant because it's clear that she's not ready for this step. Rory doesn't know what it means to struggle, and motherhood is all about sacrifice. Maybe Rory can be inspired by watching her best friend, Lane, raise the twins that resulted from an unplanned pregnancy. Or perhaps seeing Paris go through a divorce will help Rory understand what it takes to raise a child alone. \nRory is 32 years old in the revival. This is the same age that Lorelai was when the show originally began. Lorelai got pregnant with Rory when she was 16, and now Rory is pregnant at twice that age. The differences in their life experiences could mean major differences in how Rory parents compared to her mother, but only time—and more episodes—will tell. Word on the web is that more episodes post-revival could be in the works, but I'm not sure that I will want to watch them. I no longer have questions about what happens to Rory because, to me, it's not worth caring about her anymore. Although maybe if she followed in her mother's footsteps and pulled a Lorelai by leaving everything she knows behind to start anew, I could get on board. Rory still has a lot of growing up to do; I'm just glad that everybody sees it now. NYLON Video",

      "text": "Courtesy of OBB Pictures  48PM PT \nNetflix has acquired exclusive streaming rights to “ One in a Billion ,” a feature-length documentary about basketball player Satnam Singh Bhamara — chronicling his journey to become the first Indian-born basketball player drafted into the NBA. \nThe film will debut on Netflix worldwide Dec. 6. “One in a Billion” features NBA commissioner Adam Silver, Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire Mark Cuban, Sacramento Kings owner Vivek Ranadivé, and Tory Justice, the NBA’s senior director of international basketball operations. \nThe movie follows the 7-foot-2 Singh from his home of Ballo Ke, a farming village in rural India, and builds up to a climactic night in New York City as he attempts to make history in the 2015 NBA draft. He was selected by the Dallas Mavericks as the team’s 52nd overall pick, and currently plays as a center for the Texas Legends of the NBA Development League. \nRoman Gackowski directed the film, and OBB Pictures president and CEO Michael D. Ratner produced alongside Gackowski. OBB and Ratner are repped by UTA and 3 Arts Entertainment. The film is a production of OBB in partnership with Media Weaver and RGTV. \nOBB Pictures, based in Beverly Hills, continues to add to its slate of recent releases that include scripted comedy series “The 5th Quarter” for Verizon’s Go90; Viceland and ESPN’s “The Clubhouse” featuring Malcolm Jenkins; and ESPN’s “30 for 30 Shorts” film “Gonzo @ the Derby” that premiered at the Tribeca Film Festival. Earlier this year, OBB also inked partnerships with Mandalay Sports Media and Authentic Brands Group, which owns entertainment brands including Marilyn Monroe, Muhammad Ali, Elvis Presley and Shaquille O’Neal.

      "text": "source: youtube.com \n  \n\"Iron Man 3\" actor James Badge Dale plays a science researcher who leads an elite special forces team into a deadly battle against an invisible enemy in the newly-released trailer for the new Netflix film \"Spectral.\" \nMarking the feature directorial debut of commercial director Nic Mathieu, this military sci-fi thriller, which appears to be a cross between \"Edge of Tomorrow\" and \"Battle Los Angeles,\" imagines a nightmare scenario in which Europe is overrun by ghost-like alien invaders. They can kill indiscriminately and can strike without much warning. So, in order to gather intel, military forces have been ordered to move further into war-torn areas to get a better look at the enemy in action. And what they find is truly horrifying. \nIn addition to Badge Dale, the cast also includes Emily Mortimer (HBO's The Newsroom), Bruce Greenwood (The People v. O.J. Simpson), Clayne Crawford (TV's Lethal Weapon), Cory Hardrict (American Sniper), Max Martini (Pacific Rim), Ryan Robbins (Warcraft), and Stephen Root (Amazon's The Man in the High Castle). \nWeta Workshop and Weta Digital designed and created all the weaponry and the digital effects in the film, which is set premiere next week on Friday, December 9, only on Netflix. \nsynopsis: When an otherworldly force wreaks havoc on a war-torn European city, an engineer teams up with an elite Special Ops unit to stop it. \n\ndirected by Nic Mathieu \nstarring James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer, Bruce Greenwood, Stephen Root, Clayne Crawford, Max Martini, Ryan Robbins, Cory Hardrict, Louis Ozawa Changchien, Ursula Parker \nrelease date December 9, 2016 (on Netflix)",

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nThere’s no way for anyone to prove outright that Santo Cilauro , Tom Gleisner , and Rob Sitch , the creative team behind the new animated comedy Pacific Heat , have ever seen a single episode of FX’s groundbreaking Archer . Plenty of creative people come to the same idea for a story or a character independently, and there’s honestly nothing wrong with the same story being told from several different perspectives. In fact, that seems to be the principle mode that Hollywood has been working under for the last decade or so. \nIn the case of Pacific Heat , the similarities between this Australian comedy and Archer are largely in overall concept rather than in perspective, style, or sense of humor. The Netflix series follows a quartet of spies working to take down a variety of international criminal organizations, reporting to an angry chief and relying on the intel of a studied computer expert. There’s little point in getting into the characters – the dumb but brave leader, his dumber, stronger sidekick, the smart, sensitive woman agent, etc. – as the series doesn’t seem to care about any of them beyond their ability to deploy what I assume are meant to be jokes. \nIndeed, the primary problem with Pacific Heat is that it simply isn’t funny. It doesn’t help that the energy of the vocal performances is remarkably low, as if no one involved was excited about what they were being asked to read and galvanize. The aforementioned jokes are also largely vague, familiar, and timed horribly, such as a repeating gag of people attempting to close doors or the lead character mistaking a city in Vietnam for a Korean restaurant. That last joke, in particular, is representative of a mildly alarming strain of bad jokes made at the expense of Asian people, which make up a conspicuous amount of the one-liners in the episodes that were screened for critics. \nThis is where it is instructive to compare the series with Archer . The title character of the FX show, voiced with sublime comic delivery by H. Jon Benjamin , is an Olympic-level asshole, self-serving, self-excusing, sexist, and prone to lashing out over the tiniest infractions against his ego. And yet, he’s also an inventive, intelligent, and intensely well-trained spy who is capable of getting out of dangerous situations with a mix of daring and macho idiocy. He’s a complicated character, as are the rest of his team, and the humor comes as much from pauses and gestures as it does from ridiculous actions, one-liners, and a slew of sharp pop-culture references. The series practices a honed level of playful self-awareness that neither slackens the narrative tension nor reduces the humor to overt, repetitive parody. \nIn other words, Archer is chaotic without being messy, unhinged yet focused and detail-oriented, and just plain uproarious. In contrast, Pacific Heat feels hollowed out and devoid of even the slightest measure of personality. Even the animation design feels completely apathetic and bare-bones, which might have been fine if the writing had elicited any emotion beyond boredom and one or two blips of offense. There’s no joy in knowing that the creative team behind enjoyable charmers like The Dish and The Castle crafted such a relentlessly miserable experience but there’s no honor in defending this stuff either. \nRating: ★ – Just No. \nPacific Heat is available for streaming on Netflix starting December 2nd.

      "text": "SHARE 0 \nNetflix is extremely coy when it comes to reporting on their ratings, never releasing exact numbers, but a Silicon Valley-based company called Symphony Advanced Media seems to have cracked the code… and where the service’s Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life revival landed on the charts may surprise you. Citing Symphony Advanced Media’s numbers, The Wrap reports that the Gilmore revival netted 4.971 million viewers in the Ages 18-49 demographic, placing it ahead of Season 1 of Marvel’s Luke Cage (3.387 million) yet behind this year’s other big update of a TV classic, Fuller House (7.330 million). With the latest season of Orange is the New Black reported at 5.842 million, it is likely that the Gilmore update could surpass it. Image via Netflix Despite the decent showing, it is unknown if Netflix and their production partners at Warner Bros. Television will give us more Gilmore. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino hasn’t committed to whether or not she will take the series beyond “the final four words” that she had always intended to go with. Symphony AM also came up with some additional interesting metrics: For example, the first episodes of all of this year’s Marvel Comics-inspired shows outpaced the “Winter” episode that launched Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life. Do note, though, that Gilmore’s premiere was twice as long as the usual Marvel Netflix opener. Where do these numbers come from? For a year now, Symphony has been using audio recognition software to chart what a viewer is watching, gathering data through a user’s cell phone microphone. It sounds a bit invasive, but if it creates a way to gauge ratings, it is at the very least interesting. As Netflix creates more and more individual series, an idea of the numbers should give a clear picture of what may or may not be back. Starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel, Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life is currently streaming on Netflix. Related Content",

      "text": "The Best Anime On Netflix Streaming \nEvery time we remember that the Death Note adaptation for Netflix is still happening, we shed a small tear. Luckily, the latest news makes us feel more optimistic. \nMasi Oka, best known for playing Hiro Nakamura on Heroes , announced that he has an undisclosed role in the film. \nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly about his departure from his current gig on Hawaii Five-0 , Oka briefly discussed his involvement with the Netflix film. \n“Whatever is ahead, I’m very fortunate to be able to do things also behind-the-scenes, creating some TV shows and also producing a lot of movies,” he said. “I recently finished producing Death Note for Netflix, which I have a part in as well.” \nWe already knew that Oka was going to be producing the adaptation, but the news that he’ll also have a part in it is welcome. Death Note was a Japanese manga first, and before Oka announced he was going to have a role, few Japanese actors had been announced as part of the cast. \nDeath Note stars Nat Wolff as Light, the teenager that finds a Death Note, a notebook that can kill anybody just by writing their name in it. Willam Dafoe will be voicing the death God Ryuk, who dropped the notebook in the first place. Margaret Qualley, Keith Stanfield, and Paul Nakauchi have also been cast. \nIt’s unclear who Oka will be playing since most of the main cast has been announced, but we think he would be a good Touta Matsuda, an awkward police officer assigned to the Death Note case who acts as a little comic relief and the heart of the investigation. \nDeath Note is expected to premiere sometime in 2017.

      "text": "How do you stop an enemy you can’t see coming? That’s the basis behind Spectral , Netflix’s original sci-fi feature, which got its first official trailer today.\nOnce set to be a summer tentpole release under Universal, Netflix took over the reigns. Not known for their extensive marketing campaigns, this first look at their expensive new sci-fi project comes a mere week before it hits the streaming site. It finds James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood as a special-ops team fighting a race of supernatural aliens attacking the world. While the trailer doesn’t give away a lot in the way of plot, it does showcase a great deal in terms of scope, proving that Netflix is willing to pay top dollars to provide high-grade cinema to their monthly-paying audience. Here’s hoping Spectral ‘s story is given as much care as its high-quality special effects.\nIf nothing else, Spectral should serve as an interesting showcase for how Netflix’s original films can (and hopefully will) hold up away from their Adam Sandler comedies, Kevin James productions and other lackluster features, especially of late. Besides the films they’ve acquired from other distributors, including the acclaimed Beasts of No Nation and The Little Prince , their original film content hasn’t quite reached the heights of their award-winning television. Hopefully this is the start of something great for the content creator then.\nFeaturing elements from other films, both popular and not, including Black Hawk Down , Battle: Los Angeles , Saving Private Ryan , Skyline and more, Spectral doesn’t look quite as original as it would likely hope, but it still looks sleek, stylish and very promising in the visuals department. It’s a shame it can’t be seen on the big screen, but hey, that’s how it goes these days.\nDirected by first-time filmmaker Nic Mathieu, Spectral hits Netflix starting December 9.\n",

      "text": "December 2, 2016 1:00 pm From left: Roku; Apple; Amazon If you're looking to stream Netflix, Amazon, Hulu or other services for the first time, want to upgrade to the latest tech, or want to give a loved one the gift of streaming, here are the most popular hardware options to choose from. Chromecast Chromecast Ultra The idea of “casting” can scare nontechies. It shouldn’t: Simply plug the tiny Chromecast into your TV and, after an easy setup via a smartphone or tablet, you’ll be able to use those devices to stream Netflix, Hulu, Amazon Prime, etc. to your television. If you own a Google Home, voice command allows you to instruct the Chromecast to play YouTube videos (more apps like Netflix will be compatible soon). $69 Apple Apple TV You ask Siri the weather. Why not also instruct her to “Show me TV shows with James Marsden”? The Siri-enabled Apple TV (available in 32GB and 64GB) will search iTunes and Netflix for a list you can then narrow down by saying, “Just the Westerns” or “Just the new ones.” One issue: Apple TV doesn’t have an Amazon app, so the only way to watch Amazon Prime shows is to stream them to the device via another Apple product. $149–$199 Amazon Amazon Fire Stick, Fire TV Like shoes and bags, your player should match your TV. The Fire TV runs 4K Ultra HD video, so it pairs well with new souped-up sets. While little bro the Stick doesn’t, it’s low in price and super small (more counter space!). Both have remotes that run Amazon’s voice assistant, Alexa. Want to rewind to see that Grey’s Anatomy kiss again? Say, “Rewind 30 seconds.” Want to skip the Walking Dead in which Glenn dies? Say, “Next episode.” Fire Stick: $40; Fire TV: $90 Roku Roku Stick, Roku Ultra Think of the easiest thing to do. Using a Roku is easier. The pared-down home screens make getting to Netflix, Hulu and other platforms brainless. The search function is “agnostic” and won’t prioritize one streaming service’s content over another’s—so you’ll never accidentally buy a movie you can watch through one of your monthly subscriptions. The Roku Stick is the only portable device with a quad-core processor (i.e., it works as smoothly as the bigger boxes). The Ultra plays 4K video, has a voice-controlled remote and a “lost remote finder” feature. Roku Stick: $50; Roku Ultra: $130 < >",

      "text": "Netflix, Google tech can aid our understanding of planets Toronto, Dec 2, 2016 (PTI) Machine learning - a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from Google to Netflix - can help scientists determine whether planetary systems are stable or not, a new study has found.\nMachine learning is used in fraud detection and sorting spam in Google and in making movie recommendations on Netflix.\nNow, a team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada have developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not.\n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" said Dan Tamayo, postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough.\nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task.\nThe benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient.\nThe method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability. \"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" he said.\nIt is important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed.\nIt can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation.\nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, noted Tamayo.\n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he added.\nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year.\nThe two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system. \"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" said Tamayo.\nThe research was published in the Astrophysical Journal Letters.",

      "text": "\nEager to see a sci-fi war movie this month but too lazy to leave your house for Rogue One ? Netflix has got you covered. Last month the streaming service scooped up Legendary’s Spectral . Nic Mathieu ‘s directorial debut centers around a Special Ops team going on a deadly mission to stop a wave of otherworldly forces.\nJames Badge Dale , Emily Mortimer , Bruce Greenwood , Clayne Crawford , Jimmy Akingbola , and Max Martini play a few of the humans that get mixed up in this crazy mess, which has been described as a sort of supernatural Black Hawk Down . Check out the first Spectral trailer below. \n\nSpectral has had a rough time getting to the screen. Shooting began all the way back in 2014 in Budapest, and the finished film sat on a shelf for over a year in anticipation of an August 2016 release from Universal. Then, just a few months before it was supposed to hit theaters, Universal quietly yanked the film from its schedule. Finally, last month, Netflix announced they’d picked it up to distribute.\nNone of that seems to bode well for the movie, but on paper it actually sounds pretty decent. Scripted by George Nolfi ( The Bourne Ultimatum ) and based on a story by Mathiu and Ian Fried , Spectral centers on an engineer who joins forces with a Special Ops team after mysterious phantoms code-named Spectral begin killing people in a battle-scarred city. The film boasts weaponry by Weta Workshop and VFX by Weta Digital, and a score by Junkie XL ( Mad Max: Fury Road ).\nIn practice, the Spectral trailer looks… fine. It’s not bad-looking, but it feels a little generic, and the central premise is inherently kind of goofy. (There are many shots of CG knocking over brawny soldiers.) Still, for those evenings when you just want to watch a bunch of ghosts blowing people up, this could hit the spot.\nSpectral will be on Netflix December 9 .\nThe post ‘Spectral’ Trailer: Soldiers Battle Ghosts (or Something) on Netflix appeared first on /Film .\n",

As with last year, the lineup does seemingly look a little bit bare but we’ll likely have an update later in the month with many more titles announced. \nStill, there’s one big Netflix release which has a tonne of anticipation behind it and a lot to live up to. \nWe’ll be back later in the month for a full January 2017 new Netflix releases preview but for now here’s what’s currently scheduled. One Day at a Time \nJanuary 6th \nVery little is known so far about the reboot of the Norman Lear classic but what we do know sounds like a perfect homage to one of the TV writers most loved shows. The show will be 13 episodes long and will focus on a Cuban-American family who are struggling to keep it together after the separation of the mother and father. Lear returns as an executive producer of the show and as you can see from the picture above Stephen Tobolowsky is confirmed to be in the cast along with Rita Moreno, Justina Machado and Thomas Barbusca. \nLear returns as an executive producer of the show and as you can see from the picture above Stephen Tobolowsky is confirmed to be in the cast along with Rita Moreno, Justina Machado and Thomas Barbusca. A Series of Unfortunate Events (Season 1) \nJanuary 13th \nThis will likely be Netflix’s biggest release of 2016, and it comes on January 13th! The TV adaption of the classic book series is scheduled to release all eight episodes on the second Friday of the month. \nThe series has been gathering a lot of anticipation so far with a lot riding on the show to at the very least eclipse the movie made starring Jim Carrey. All evidence is pointing to the show being in good hands, though with a trailer that manages to capture the perfect feeling that the books leave you with. \nA Series of Unfortunate Events stars Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf, Patrick Warburton, Malina Weissman and Aasif Mandvi. Voltron: Legendary Defender (Season 2) \nJanuary 20th \nNetflix put out some excellent Dreamworks shows in 2016 and among the very best was the reboot of Voltron. It’s likely we’ll get a similar amount episodes again and will pick up where season 1 left off. \nIn case you’re new to the series, the show shares many similarities to Dreamworks other big show Transformers but instead focuses on four teens who become involved in an intergalactic battle against King Zarkon and his armies. Chelsea Episodes \nChelsea will be returning in January after the Christmas break with more interviews, sketches, trips abroad and everything else her fanbase has come to love from her Netflix show. New episodes air on Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. Also on What's on Netflix Subscribe to our newsletter",

Try not to publicly flail with excitement, but Barry's about Obama's junior year at Columbia University, and yup—it looks amazing.

      "text": "\n“I think that Blonde will be one of the ten best movies ever made,” Andrew Dominik says. “That’s why I want to do it.” And the director behind The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford has been wanting to do it for many years now. In 2010, Blonde and My Week with Marilyn were the competing Marilyn Monroe biopics. Six years later and Dominik is still trying to make the film, which will not star Jessica Chastain and, despite Netflix reportedly backing the movie, no deal has been struck yet.\nBelow, learn more about the Marilyn Monroe biopic.\n\nOver the summer, Dominik told Indiewire he cast a new unnamed actress as Marilyn Monroe and was aiming for a January start date. At the time, the story went that Netflix was financing Blonde and planning a limited theatrical release before it was made available to stream. But while promoting his Nick Cave doc, One More Time With Feeling , Dominik told Collider “it’s not, in any way, a done deal.” Of course, the filmmaker hopes a deal gets made, but he’s unsure if he’ll finally get to shoot the biopic anytime soon.\nSince Dominik believes Blonde will be one of the greatest movies of all time, though, he’s not going to give up on it. When asked why he’s so passionate about the project, he responded:\nIt’s a film about the human condition. It tells the story of how a childhood trauma shapes an adult who’s split between a public and a private self. It’s basically the story of every human being, but it’s using a certain sense of association that we have with something very familiar, just through media exposure. It takes all of those things and turns the meanings of them inside out, according to how she feels, which is basically how we live. It’s how we all operate in the world. It just seems to me to be very resonant. I think the project has got a lot of really exciting possibilities, in terms of what can be done, cinematically.\nDominik has ambitious plans for Blonde , based on the Joyce Carol Oates novel of the same name. The script has very little dialogue in it. Dominik doesn’t think there’s single a scene in the Blonde script that’s longer than two pages. He wants to make a film that’s “an avalanche of images and events,” more accessible and, in his words, faster paced than his previous features.\nSpeaking of his prior work, for all you fellow Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford fans out there: in case you were wondering if anything ever came of those fan outcries to get the epic western a Criterion release, nothing ever did:\nI don’t think Criterion are interested in it. I don’t think that they feel it’s significant enough for them. There was this really lovely guy, who was a film student, that organized this Jesse James revival, either last year or the year before. He was a film student or something, and Jesse James is his favorite movie. He basically took it upon himself to create a Jesse James revival and he set up all these screens at various Cinematheque type of things. He tried to get Criterion interested, and they weren’t.\nThe post Andrew Dominik’s Marilyn Monroe Biopic ‘Blonde’ Is Not a Done Deal at Netflix appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "Prayers to Netflix ( NFLX ) have finally paid off, as the video-streaming deity announced on Wednesday that it would allow subscribers to download films and programs for offline viewing on their mobile devices.\nThe decision was a practical call for the company. With offline viewing, there is now no need to stop your Stranger Things binge when boarding a plane. In addition, watching videos on your phone will no longer eat up data allowances when you're beyond the range of Wi-Fi.\nNetflix concedes that it made the decision after many customers requested this feature. After all, other streaming services such as Amazon Video already offer this convenient function.\nHowever, there is a bit of a rub: Titles belonging to Walt Disney ( DIS ) will not be available for download, nor will programs that Netflix has produced in conjunction with the House of Mouse, including Marvel-licensed shows such as Jessica Jones . Although there has been no word given as to why Disney properties aren't available for download, it's safe to assume that it's to give the company the exclusive rights for whenever it creates its own download service.\nOf course, there have been rumors spreading lately that Disney itself might become closer partners with Netflix, and some have even suggested that the entertainment juggernaut might make a play to purchase the streaming service.\nOn Thursday, Bernstein Research analyst Todd Juenger wrote that Disney should purchase Netflix and calculated the price tag at $70 billion. He noted that, in the long run, the inevitable outcome is that Disney will own a streaming service, and the price of just outright buying Netflix would be more attractive than the time and resource costs of Disney building its own service.",

      "title": "Best Thrillers & Horror Movies On Netflix For December 2016 That Are Silly-Good",
      "text": "\nSome of the best horror movies and thrillers are on Netflix, and a few new titles have been added for December 2016. For subscribers that are avid fans of the genres, it can often feel like the categories of thrillers and horror movies have been forgotten by Netflix; often, months go by without any new titles being added that are of high-quality. And though we didn’t get an abundance of new titles added to the genres, there are a few gems that have arrived to Netflix at the beginning of December. The one thing this small group of films has in common is that even though they do have suspense, they are silly-good and that makes for some fun entertainment.\nNew Horror Movies And Thrillers For December 2016 A Christmas Horror Story \nBecause nothing says Christmas like William Shatner or a demonic beast, A Christmas Horror Story was just added in December and it’s just in time for the holidays. There are quite a few horror movies that feature the character of Krampus, but this is one of the more unique ones. And for those that like their horror-flick cocktail with a twist, this film offers an excellent one. Variety describes why this is one of the best horror movies on Netflix for December 2016 .\n“Performances and packaging are solid, despite a few uneven CGI effects, with decent production polish overall. While “A Christmas Horror Story” lacks the distinctive ideas or directorial style to be truly memorable, it’s crafted with enough care and affection to be modestly enjoyable — certainly more so than most cheesy gimmick comedy-thriller pics that end up in the horror-feature purgatory of Hulu freebies.”\nHouse of Wax \nThough many would argue that this film shouldn’t be on a list of “best horror movies,” if you know what to expect then you will enjoy it. This is a supposed remake of the Vincent Price classic, but it bears little-to-no resemblance. This is a very formulaic film, but it works well when in the right mindset or environment; this is the type of film you watch with a group of friends. There is genuine suspense, humor, and jump-scare moments for all to enjoy.\n[Image by Warner Bros. Pictures] Switchback \nThough many viewers and critics panned this film, this reporter included in that statement, many audiences enjoyed it. It was released on December 1, and it has already garnered a score from Netflix subscribers of four out of five stars. Though many feel this is an underrated film, the great Roger Ebert explains why this is one of the most overrated thrillers on Netflix for December .\n“[This] is not a good movie, but it does an admirable job of distracting us from how bad it is. If they’d thrown out the two leading characters and started all over with the locations, the lore and the supporting actors, they might have had something here. Time and again the movie fascinates us with digressions, only to jerk back to the helpless main story line.”\nWith an audience torn as to whether or not this film is good, there is only one way to see where you stand on the issue. But don’t say I didn’t warn you.\nTales From The Darkside: The Movie \nJust added at the end of November, this anthology film is no stranger to fans of horror movies. Even casual fans of the genre should find this film to be, at the very least, fun and entertaining. And in this reporter’s opinion, if a movie has entertained you then it has done its job.\n[Image by Paramount Pictures] Longtime Favorites The thrillers and horror movies listed below are longtime favorites of Netflix subscribers, as well as most critics, and they are still available through December. Newer subscribers are likely to enjoy these titles, and many will enjoy revisiting them.\nHousebound Jaws Creep Hush Curse of Chucky Cape Fear Hannibal Nightcrawler The Perfect Host OTHER NETFLIX AND HORROR ARTICLES FROM THE INQUISITR \nBest Thrillers And Horror Movies On Netflix 2016: ‘The Perfect Host,’ Intruder,’ And ‘Grand Piano’ \nBest Horror Movies Of 2016 Still To Come, Plus Horror Movies For A Killer Christmas \nThe Best Netflix Movies Arriving In December, Plus Every Movie Leaving Netflix \nThe Top 10 Best Horror Movies Of 2015 & 2016, As Ranked By Critics \nThough it would be nice to get even more thrillers and horror movies added to Netflix, there are still a few titles that just arrived in December worth watching; and there are plenty of titles worth revisiting.\n[Featured Image by Image Entertainment]\nBest Thrillers & Horror Movies On Netflix For December 2016 That Are Silly-Good is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

Netflix September 15 launched service in France, the first of six European countries planned in the coming months. (Photo: Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images) \nTALLAHASSEE -- Governor Rick Scott has the perfect solution for streamers who want to \"Netflix and chill\" without paying local taxes. \nMove on down to Florida. \nScott went on Twitter Thursday to encourage people to resist the ongoing trend of local and state governments considering tax hikes on streaming media . Pasadena, California is pondering a 9.4 percent tax. While Chicago already has a 9 percent tax, which has users hopping mad and suing the city. Absurd that cities/ states across the country are passing taxes on subscription streaming services like @Netflix . — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) December 1, 2016 \nScott said it is \"absurd\" that taxes on Neflix exist. He then followed that the Sunshine State welcomes all who want to stream tax-free. To everyone who wants to enjoy streaming services like @Netflix without additional taxes, we look forward to welcoming you to FL! — Rick Scott (@FLGovScott) December 1, 2016 \n(© 2016 WTSP) ",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Marco Polo) Is Netflix communicating with HBO for the transfer of 'Marco Polo?' \nNetflix has yet to announce a green light for \"Marco Polo\" season 3 but there are already reports suggesting that the series may soon be acquired by HBO. \nThe streaming giant has done a great job in bringing the historical drama into the world of binge watching. However, it appears that no settlements have been made yet regarding the third season. Fans are wondering if the new episodes will ever arrive in the near future, and some suggest that the show may have been axed secretly. \nHowever, hope has been ignited among fans as the latest rumors imply that HBO may be acquiring \"Marco Polo\" so Kublai Khan's (Benedict Wong) story can be continued. HBO is known to come up with high quality television shows and \"Marco Polo\" may be a good catch for the famous channel. \nNetflix reportedly had to come up with a staggering $90 million to kick off production for the hit series but rumor has it that the streaming service is having a hard time collecting the same amount for \"Marco Polo\" season 3. This could be the reason why the new season has not been announced yet. Advertisement \nIf HBO does purchase \"Marco Polo\" from Netflix, fans can expect the series to keep up with the other quality shows on the channel such as \"Game of Thrones\" and \"Empire.\" \nMeanwhile, Wong has taken to Twitter to express his gratefulness for being a part of the series. \"Happy Thanksgiving. Grateful to have met and shared an adventure with my @MarcoPoloMP fam, from all over the World,\" he said on Nov. 24. This is the first time in weeks that Wong mentioned the show since he has been focusing on promoting his movie with Benedict Cumberbatch. Happy Thanksgiving. Grateful to have met and shared an adventure with my @MarcoPoloMP fam, from all over the World. https://t.co/f1BaxfY0WD — Benedict Wong (@wongrel) November 25, 2016 \nWong has been busy over the past months and some speculate that his hectic schedule may also be delaying the announcement for \"Marco Polo\" season 3. The \"Doctor Strange\" star has not yet responded to the rumors. \nFor now, fans can only hope that whatever happens on the table, \"Marco Polo\" will still give viewers at least a reasonable finale that will live on in the history of television.

      "text": "If you haven’t heard the news, Netflix finally bellied up to the bar and opened up its vast vault of online TV shows, documentaries, and movies to the offline world. The offline download feature is still fresh, so figuring out how to use it and what shows and movies you can use it with is a little tricky. Due to licensing restrictions, not everything on Netflix is available for offline download, such as the new four episodes of Gilmore Girls . However all of the Netflix original series and a few licensed titles like Parks and Recreation and Spotlight are right there and waiting for you to sit down and never take your eyes off the screen with a beer in hand.\nRELATED: You're Going to Need a Bigger iPad: Netflix Announces Downloadable Content\nTo see everything you can watch right now, tap the menu in the Netflix iOS or Netflix Android app on your device and go to the “Available for Download” section. If it’s available for download, a downward arrow icon will appear next to each episode. For movies, the same download icon that you need to click will appear in the “details” section just below the movie description. You'll need to be connected for this. Once your selection has completed downloading, you can access it at any time in the “My Downloads” tab.\nNetflix does not have a list of what its users can download, so we opened up the app ourselves and took a look. For now, here's a quick rundown of a few of the shows and films you can save and watch later:\nThe Crown\nBlack Mirror\nOrange Is the New Black\nMaking a Murderer\nBloodline\nPeaky Blinders\nChelsea\nBojack Horseman\nAziz Ansari: Buried Alive\nNarcos\nChef's Table\nStranger Things\nFriday Night Lights\nLaw & Order: Special Victims Unit\nNurse Jackie\nHouse\nDope\nDexter\nAn Idiot Abroad\nColumbo\nMaster of None\nA Very Murray Christmas To Kill a Mockingbird\nWeeds\nTrainspotting\nNightcrawler\nBlue Is the Warmest Color\nMichael Che Matters\nWet Hot American Summer\nWhat Happened, Miss Simone?\nFrances Ha\nOliver Stone's Untold History of the United States\nRichard Pryor Live in Concert\nBurn After Reading\nMad Men\n30 Rock\nSing Street\nBoyhood\nJaws\nGrizzly Man\nBlack Hawk Down\nBreaking Bad\nThat '70s Show\nChef\nFreaks and Geeks\nSt. Vincent\nEternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\nFruitvale Station\nCinderella Man\nHeathers\nMoonrise Kingdom\nJiro Dreams of Sushi\nGood Will Hunting\nPulp Fiction\nThe Little Rascals\nNo Country for Old Men\nBetter Call Saul\nThe Imitation Game\nDazed and Confused\nSixteen Candles\nSpotlight\nThe Office\nBeasts of No Nation\nMeet the Patels\nKung Fu Panda 3\nCalifornication\nFrida\nAnimal House\nAmelie\nReservoir Dogs\nInto the Inferno\nLouis C.K.: Hilarious\nLouis C.K. Live at the Comedy Store\nKevin Hart: I'm a Grown Little Man\nParks and Recreation RELATED: Television Simplified: What to Watch Every Night This Week\nAnd if you're worried about storage on your device, you can download any title available for offline viewing in either standard quality (which is a slightly lower video quality that uses less storage space and downloads faster) or high quality (which uses more storage space and takes more time to download, but looks damn good). To change the download quality of your videos, follow these steps from Netflix . Or maybe it's finally time to make some room available on your phone and move all those photos to Dropbox. Happy binging!",

Full Bio The author is a Forbes contributor. The opinions expressed are those of the writer. Loading ... Loading ... This story appears in the {{article.article.magazine.pretty_date}} issue of {{article.article.magazine.pubName}}. Subscribe \nEddy Wu, Netflix Director of Product Innovation, announced on Wednesday that the online streaming service will begin offering all of its subscribers the option to download select films and TV series to smartphones and tablets running on iOS and Android. \nThe new feature, which can be accessed at no additional cost, will enable subscribers to save downloaded films and TV programs to their devices for viewing while offline. The impetus for the change, as Netflix’s Wu explained it, is that “While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited.” Image credit: Netflix \nWu’s post on a Netflix webpage neglected to mention that the streaming giant is playing catchup here with Amazon, whose Prime Video service has allowed downloads for more than a year, and Youtube Red and Starz, which similarly enable users to download content to digital devices. Netflix had previously considered but resisted extending such a capability to their entire subscriber base, suggesting they would first offer it in countries where the requisite bandwidth for regular Netflix viewing was constrained. \nThe announcement’s timing coincides nicely with the holiday gift-giving season, and is no doubt intended as part of the company’s overall year-end marketing push. \nThe “Download & Go” feature, as Netflix calls it, can be employed by clicking a new button that appears on a film or TV program’s details page. Only a small subset of the service’s thousands of titles will initially be available for download. \nThe first batch of titles offered comprises an eclectic mix of Netflix original content and popular and award-winning fare from around the world. Netflix originals already available for download include such series as \"House of Cards,\"\"Orange is the New Black,\"\"Stranger Things,\"\"Master of None,\"\"Narcos,\" and \"The Crown,\" among others. Movies offered range from popular titles like \"Kung Fu Panda 3,\"\"Pulp Fiction,\" and \"London Has Fallen\" to specialty fare like \"Boyhood,\"\"Frida\" and \"Blue is the Warmest Color.\" \nContent that Netflix subscribers can not currently download includes Marvel series like \"Luke Cage,\"\"Daredevil,\" and \"Jessica Jones,\" and feature films \"Zootopia\" and \"Jungle Book.\" All of these titles are owned by Disney, which may indicate some reluctance by that studio to authorize downloads of its content.

      "text": "Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Warning: This recap for the “Fall” episode of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life contains storyline and character spoilers.\nIn which Gilmore Girls fans get everything we ever wanted for Luke, Lorelai, and Emily; Sookie returns; and Rory adds a very big chapter to her Gilmore girls book by bringing the mother/child theme full circle.\nLorelai Lauren Graham and Peter Krause (Credit: Netflix) More She does indeed fly to California to “do Wild ,” her motel room bed covered with all the stuff she’s going to try to fit into her ginormous backpack to prepare for her hike. While trying not to think about the sundry “DNA samples” that could be found throughout the room, Lorelai manages to stuff all her supplies in the pack — taking a break to watch an episode of Snapped — and the next morning she lugs it out the door… to run into many other women, equipped with similar packs, who also plan to go Wild -ing. When they get to the start of the trail, however, a park ranger warns them there’s a wicked storm moving in, meaning they may want to start their adventures the next day.\nLauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Lorelai’s out to begin the next day, but can’t find her permit, so her hike is postponed again. She heads off to find coffee, and when the local café is closed, she walks around outside waiting for it to open. When she stumbles upon a beautiful vista, she has an emotional reaction. Teary-eyed, she calls Emily, and gives her exactly what she’d so desperately wanted from Lorelai at the post-funeral gathering for Richard. Lorelai tells Emily about her 13th birthday, when she had been cruelly dumped by a boyfriend. She ran out of school and to the mall, where she was surprised and frightened to be confronted by Richard in the food court. But he didn’t yell at her for leaving school; he bought her a giant pretzel, then took her to a pair of movies ( Grease for Lorelai, An Unmarried Woman for him, he told Lorelai). He bought her popcorn and Red Hots, and then helped her cover up the blouse she’d worn from Emily’s closet without permission when they got home. They never spoke of the day again, but, sobbing Lorelai tells her mom, “It was the best birthday I ever had.” Emily thanks her, and Lorelai puts her stuffed backpack by a garbage can with a giant sign that says “FREE” and heads back to Stars Hollow.\nRelated: Ken Tucker Reviews: ‘Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life — Fall’ and the Final 4 Words\nLauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Read More At home, she surprises Luke in their kitchen, telling him they wouldn’t let her hike, but she figured things out without hiking. Luke interrupts to tell her he’s seen the “bolting signs,” that he knows she’s going to break up with him. She instead tells him she thinks they should get married, on a Sunday, within the month. He gets her old engagement ring — the one he bought from Kirk in the original series — and puts it on her finger.\nMelissa McCarthy and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More The icing on the cake, or cakes, many, many cakes: Sookie is back at the Dragonfly, and she surprises Lorelai with her presence and the more than a dozen wedding cakes she has made for her, including a “milestone cake” that has a mini version of Lorelai’s house, baby Rory, Lorelai’s Jeep, and the hospital where she took Sookie to get her fingertip sewn back on the first day they met. It’s an all-too-brief reunion scene, but it ends perfectly when Sookie stars to smell the food of all the chefs that were brought in during her absence, from Roy Choi to Rachel Ray.\nRelated: Gilmore Girls Fan Favorite Sean Gunn Talks Ooober, Kirk’s Marital Status, and More\nRory Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More Rory’s still toiling away at The Stars Hollow Gazette . On her way to the office one night, she witnesses some strange things (even by Stars Hollow standards): A bird in a tree says her name, and tells her, “Get ready, Rory,” a neon sign flashes from “Flowers” to the word “Tonight,” and when she gets inside the office, Esther says the words “In omnia paratus” to her. So when she turns around and sees a trio of guys wearing gorilla masks standing in the street, she knows her old pals from The Life and Death Brigade have arrived. Outside, she catches up with Finn, Robert, and Colin, who are soon joined by Logan.\n(Credit: Netflix) More The five begin one of the gang’s trademark romps, in Victorian garb and hats, as they frolic through the streets of town, breaking into Doose’s (and throwing a bunch of cash around as compensation), playing golf on the roofs of several buildings, watching Kirk’s most recent film short outdoors, and driving a convertible off to a secret dance club. Rory and Logan dance, then grab a table, where he offers her the key to one of his family’s homes so she can go write her book. He also apologizes about not telling her Odette was moving into his apartment, and she asks if he’s really going to marry Odette. “That’s the dynastic plan,” he tells her. They leave the club and head to a New Hampshire inn, which the guys have bought out for the night (and Colin considers buying for real the next morning). While the other members of the Brigade entertain themselves, Rory and Logan go to his suite. The next morning, he awakens to find her looking out the window. He tells her he wanted it to be special, and she says it was a perfect night. Downstairs, the guys are drinking Finn’s breakfast martinis, and Rory tells each of them goodbye. “Every ride has to end,” she tells Logan, who frames her face with his hands as if he’s taking a photo to remember her by.\nMatt Czuchry and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More She had returned to Logan the key to his family’s house, telling him she knew where she was going to go to write her book. It turns out to be the Gilmore mansion. Emily’s away with her staff, and Rory wanders around the house, remembering special moments with her family, before she goes into Richard’s study, sits down at his desk, and pulls out her laptop.\nThree chapters in hand, she shows up to her mom’s house in the middle of the night. Paul Anka rouses Lorelai, who goes to the kitchen to confab with Rory. They each pull out a variety of leftovers and snacks, hug, and it’s revealed they’ve been in contact, via text. Lorelai tells Rory she’s getting married on the first day of the Harvest Festival, which Rory guesses means there will be an open hot dog cart for everyone. Rory also slides across the table a copy of everything she’s written for the book so far, and asks Lorelai to make her a deal: read it, and if she hates it, Rory won’t finish it and will destroy the pages she already wrote. Lorelai later returns the chapters of The Gilmore Girls unread, telling Rory she wants to read it when it’s finished, and joking that if she hates it, she’ll just sue her. She does have one note: “Drop the The . Just Gilmore Girls . It’s cleaner.”\nAlexis Bledel and Lauren Graham (Credit: Netflix) More Luke Luke’s Liz and T.J. problem has been handled: Jess informs him that they were deemed too weird for the vegetable cult, which has kicked them out. While Jess is at the diner, he also provides a listening ear to his uncle, who is worried that Lorelai is about to dump him. They’re fighting in public, and she took off on the Wild trip, which he thinks equals a looming break up. “I’m now a guy who snipes at his girl and uses the world ‘oops,’” Luke says. Jess agrees it’s not looking good for the couple.\nMilo Ventimiglia and Scott Patterson (Credit: Netflix) More All’s well that ends well, and Luke and Lorelai’s pre-wedding wedding at the gazebo is perfection. The whole affair also brings out one of the best Luke reveals ever, better than finding out his high school nickname was Butch, or that he once wore a Star Trek T-shirt and moved around town on a skateboard for a whole year. Luke, we learn, is pretty good friends with Kiefer Sutherland. This rando fact comes up when Lorelai asks him which friends he’d like to invite to their wedding. He says Kiefer, who he bonded with when they both went to the same baseball camp years ago. They still go fishing sometimes, he says, blowing Lorelai’s mind, and prompting a whole series of 24 jokes.\nEmily Kelly Bishop\n(Credit: Netflix) More She’s still sleeping way later and longer than she used to, but Emily is beginning to think about what she wants her life to be without Richard. She decides to sell the Gilmore mansion, and she’s already purchased a beautiful waterfront estate in Nantucket (where Berta and her whole family have joined her). She’s still spending time with Jack, but the relationship seems ill-fated; when he announces he has to leave Nantucket to go back to the city, Emily is very eager to get him on his way. He thinks it means she’s more understanding than his three wives were; we think Emily’s just a very polite woman.\nRay Rice and Kelly Bishop (Credit: Netflix) More She makes her move to Nantucket a permanent one, and begins a stint as a docent at the local whaling museum (where she terrifies the children with her detailed, impassioned stories of whale killings). But she also lays down some insurance that she’ll still see plenty of her family. When Lorelai comes to her for money to buy a local property to annex the Dragonfly, Emily says yes… but only if Lorelai will agree that she and Luke will spend two weeks in the summer and one week at Christmas in Nantucket with Emily.\nAnd making it a complete family affair: The Dragonfly addition, which Lorelai thinks will help her create a new opportunity for Michel and keep him from moving to New York to work at the W Hotel, is being funded by the cash Richard willed to Luke to franchise the diner.\nLorelai and Rory The girls have made up, Rory’s book is being written with Lorelai’s approval, and Luke and Lorelai are married, grabbing Lorelai, Lane, Michel, and Rev. Skinner and getting married at the town gazebo the night before the “official,” public ceremony the next day.\nLauren Graham, Jim Jansen, and Scott Patterson (Credit: Netflix) More In the morning, as the mother and daughter sit on the steps of the gazebo, we finally hear those four words, the final four words that Gilmore Girls fans have been waiting on for more than a decade:\nRory: Mom?\nLorelai: Yeah?\nRory: “I’m pregnant.”\n(Credit: Netflix) More Related: Underwhelmed By ‘Gilmore Girls’ Final Words? So Was the Cast!\nElsewhere in Stars Hollow (and beyond): * Luke’s Diner is dead quiet… someone learned his real WiFi password and shared it with everyone, and all his customers are sitting around like zombies, splitting bagels four ways and sucking up his free Internet access.\n* Colin buys the secret dance club The Life and Death Brigade goes to, on the spot, and decrees only Rosemary Clooney music will be played in the club from now on.\n* A big part of Emily’s new life after Richard’s death is letting go of a lot of bullshit, a word she uses repeatedly at what turns out to be her final DAR meeting. The DAR leaders are interviewing a potential new applicant, a young, blond, fourth wife who they obviously are not going to admit, and who they are taking way too much delight in toying with. Emily gets up to get a cookie in the middle of the session, but when they continue batting Serena around like farm cats with a field mouse in their paws, Emily just can’t even anymore. “It’s all just a big pile of bullshit,” she announces, letting Serena know they’re only interviewing her to placate her wealthy husband, and that they’re just going to mock her when she leaves. The DAR women pitch a fit, and Emily tells them, I can’t spend any more time on artifice and bullshit.” They kick her out of their mean girls club, to which she responds, “This whole thing is dead to me anyhow,” says the woman whose whole world once revolved around who was poured the first cup of tea at a society club meeting. “It died with Richard.”\nAlexis Bledel and David Sutcliffe (Credit: Netflix) More * Rory visits Christopher at work: He’s running the Hayden family business now, that thing he’d actively avoided doing for most of his life. He tells her half-sister Gigi is in France, and he’s sorta dating someone named Lana. She tells him Lorelai and Luke are getting married, and he assures her he won’t show up. “Knowing when to admit defeat is one of my better qualities,” he says. After telling her dad about the book she’s writing, Rory gets to the point of her visit: She wants to know how he feels about the fact that Lorelai raised her alone. And she isn’t asking to make him feel bad; she seems to really just want the honest answer to the question. He tells her Lorelai, like her, was a force of nature, and that it’s what was meant to be. Rory seems satisfied with the response, if not a little sad about her dad, and her relationship with him.\n* Rory also has another reunion: Dean. They run into each other, literally, when they’re walking around at Doose’s. He’s in town visiting his parents; he lives in Scranton, has three sons, has a daughter on the way, and he’s married to someone named Jenny. He tells Rory his sister Clara is dating a guy he hates, and Rory tells him not to worry, “She’s young, it’s her first love, it’ll probably…” Dean knows all too well the rest of that sentence. But their reunion is a sweet one, with her telling him about her book and that he’ll be portrayed favorably in it, and him telling her to “Pay for it this time” when she holds up a box of cornstarch.\nJared Padalecki and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More * Speaking of Rory’s exes, Paul is finally one of them. He broke up with her, via text.\n* Lorelai and Luke — Luke! — each plan to do flash mob dances at their wedding, she to Frankie Goes to Hollywood’s “Relax” (with all the mob-sters wearing T-shirts with Luke’s face on them), he to Steely Dan’s “Hey Nineteen.” She gets Miss Patty to change Luke’s song to “Karma Chameleon” without telling Luke.\n* The men Rory wanted to marry when she was a kid: Pee-wee Herman, Edward Scissorhands, and Jerry Orbach ( Law & Order version).\nQuestions: We Got a Few * Who wrote Emily that nasty letter she insisted was from Lorelai? She threw it out there in “Spring,” and it seemed like a story we’d find out more about later, but… someone needs to brush up on his or her Chekov’s gun rule .\n* Logan’s definitely the father, right? Rory almost never saw Paul…\n* If the Palladinos had been running the show for its final season, and the final four words were the same, would Rory still have turned down Logan’s proposal?\n* The pre-wedding wedding we saw on screen was everything, but couldn’t some of the time and money budget for all those pool scenes in “Summer” been diverted so we could have actually seen those flash mob dances to “Karma Chameleon” and “Relax”?\nMilo Ventimiglia (Credit: Netflix) More * Jess tells Luke he’s over Rory, but the look on his face as he watches her through the window suggests otherwise. Her book was his idea, he’s the one who knows her well enough to suggest it would be the thing that made her fall back in love with writing… did that draw any new fans to #TeamJess? Is he destined to be her Luke?\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’ Pro/Con List: Should Rory Be With Jess or Logan?\n* They’ve gotta do another reunion now, right?\nGilmore Gift of Gab “I feel like I’m standing still. The whole world is moving, and I’m standing completely still.” — Lorelai, while bonding with some of her fellow Wild -ers.\n“It was my turn to walk Finn.” — Logan, when Rory asks him why he came to Stars Hollow.\n“Stay photogenic, I beg of you.” — Finn, while saying goodbye to Rory.\nTanc Sade and Nick Holmes (Credit: Netflix) More “The weather is beautiful today. You should have no problems in that area. However, there’s still a high probability that any outdoor activity motivated by watching a movie is probably going to end in some sort of hospitalization.” — Park ranger No. 2, to Lorelai and the other women waiting to go Wild .\n“You tell anyone about this, and we are getting a cat.” — Luke, to Paul Anka, after the dog pats Luke’s leg with his paw to get him to cool his steak dinner by blowing on it.\n“I should’ve known it would have something to do with coffee. Everything in my life has something to do with coffee. I believe, in a former life, I was coffee.” — Lorelai to Luke, about having her big epiphany while waiting on a coffee shop to open.\n“We have been through so much… we’ve watched each other go from person to person. I mean, there was Rachel, and Max and Christopher… I had to watch you marry that guy! It was awful. But we made it here. We made it through all of that.” — Luke to Lorelai, when he thinks she’s about to break up with him.\nRelated: ‘Gilmore Girls’: A Journey Through Lorelai’s Love Life\n“Luke, I think we should get married. We’ve waited too long.” — What Lorelai was actually thinking, and said, to Luke.\n“Emily, I beg of you, cheese! Richard.” — A note written on the refrigerator chalkboard at Richard and Emily’s house, something Emily is saving, and Rory spotted.\n“Ugh, her last name’s a first name. I hate that.” — Michel, about Dragonfly Inn job interviewee Molly Daniel.\n“Now, your name is Molly… why?” — Michel, with the first question of Molly’s interview.\n“ Katy Perry was sniffing around here earlier. She dresses like a hooker, but she comes with cash.” — A nun who run the Pretty Pastures retirement home, when Lorelai asks about the building being for sale after its last resident dies.\n“Nothing I’ve ever written has been this easy.” — Rory, giving the first three chapters of her book to Lorelai.\n“The diner doesn’t miss you at all. It’s in its underwear, blasting Bob Seger.” — Lorelai to Luke, who says he needs to get back to the diner.\n“That you were the greatest boyfriend alive. That you were generous and protective, and kind and strong. That as much as I wish we’d met when I was older and more mature, if I hadn’t had you with me then, I wouldn’t be the person I am today. That you taught me what safe feels like.” – Rory, telling Dean what she’ll write about him in her book.\n“It’s perfect.” — Lorelai’s text to Kirk, who was worried he had over-decorated the town square for the wedding.\n“It feels right.” — Lorelai, on being married to Luke, right after the wedding.\nRemember When … * In “You’ve Been Gilmored,” from the sixth season of the original series, Christopher meets Logan right after finding out Rory is living with her boyfriend at his apartment. It’s actually a re-meet for the fellas… they first saw each other when Christopher walked in on Rory and Logan making out at Emily and Richard’s vow renewal in Season 5. But during their first official meeting in “Gilmored,” Christopher finds out little about Logan except for the fact that he has a cool plasma TV, lives in a fancy apartment with a great view of the Yale campus, and has been kicked out of many prep schools — as had Christopher in his — which leads him to tell Rory she’s got a good man. “Interesting yardstick you’re using,” she tells her dad. When Rory visits Christopher in “Fall,” everything clicks… Logan is her Christopher, that cool, fun, often decent guy who nonetheless isn’t really going to be the strong support she may want him to be. Logan started showing some maturity in his life sooner than Christopher did in his, but basically, Rory isn’t asking Christopher to share his thoughts about allowing Lorelai to raise her just for info for her book; seems clear she was trying to make a decision about her own potential situation as a single mother. And we’re guessing she came to the conclusion that she could, and maybe should, consider having her child without Logan in the mix, especially after Christopher tells her that Lorelai raising her alone was “exactly what was supposed to happen.”\nDavid Sutcliffe and Alexis Bledel (Credit: Netflix) More * Emily’s takedown of her old DAR pals is epic, and one of her all-time greatest hits. It recalls, of course, one of her other signature moments, when she told off Logan’s mom, Shira , in the original series, after Shira made Rory feel unwelcome in her home.\n* When Logan apologizes to Rory for not telling her Odette had moved in with him, she tells him it’s OK, that they have a “no strings” policy, but it clearly isn’t OK with her. Their relationship is at the stage it was when they first started dating in college, and Rory assured Logan back then she was OK with his no-commitment approach to dating. She wasn’t then, and she isn’t now, which is just another way in which her life has gone backwards.\n* Not only did Luke use the original engagement ring again, but it was Lorelai, just like in the original series, who sparked their engagement and mercifully quick wedding in “Fall.”\n* Miss Celine, Emily’s favorite designer/seamstress/stylist, prepped Lorelai’s wedding dress and Luke’s wedding suit.\n* The song playing during the wonderful wedding montage is Sam Phillips’s “Reflecting Light,” the song that was playing the first time Luke and Lorelai danced, at Liz and T.J.’s wedding.\nYou’ve Been Gilmore-d: * Guest stars in “Fall”: Lauren Graham’s Parenthood co-star Jason Ritter as a park ranger; Lauren Graham’s Parenthood co-star and real-life love interest Peter Krause as another park ranger; and Alex Borstein as Miss Celine.\nJason Ritter (Credit: Netflix) More * Music in “Fall”: “With a Little Help From My Friends” by Joe Anderson and Jim Sturgess; “Gotango” by Olof Roter; “Botch-a-Me” by Rosemary Clooney; “Some People” by Bernadette Peters and William Parry; and “Where You Lead” by Carole King and Louise Goffin, the original series theme song that’s played during the final credits of “Fall.”\n* Pop culture and cultural references in “Fall”: REI, calliope music, boot throwing , Italian social clubs, Lucy Ricardo, Doctor Who , Starbucks, Trader Joes, boxed wine, Snapple, Vicodin, Lean Cuisine, Eat Pray Love , VitaTops, Yentl, Across the Universe , Martha Stewart, Hugh Grant, Princess Diana, Mr. Toad’s Wild Ride, The Hurt Locker , La Dolce Vita, Christian Bale, The Machinist , Hello Kitty, surrogacy, music festivals, The Sound of Music , Ian Schrager, Whoopi Goldberg, Pebble Beach, “My Sharona,” Candy Spelling, Priscilla Queen of the Desert , desnudas, Crunch, Soul Cycle, Tracy Anderson, Brentwood, Equinox, Ben Franklin, Barbara Sinatra, bottle service, Risky Business , Deanna Durbin, Eli Wallach, hora, Kirk Douglas, method acting, Baby Doll, Elia Kazan, Carroll Baker, Jack Bauer, Chloe O’Brian, Buffy the Vampire Slayer, unicorns, Beats by Dre, Ryan Gosling, Starz, Jerry Maguire , The Picture of Dorian Gray , Bugsy Siegel, The Godfather , David Mamet, Blackstone Group, Lord of the Rings , Gollum, Little House in the Big Woods , “Welcome to the Jungle,” Bewitched , Guns N’ Roses, Rande Gerber, Jonestown, Kool-Aid, Ina Garten, Right Said Fred, bingo, flash mobs, Donner Pass, and Culture Club.\nRelated: 15 Gift Ideas for the ‘Gilmore Girls’ Superfan in Your Life\n* The food they ate in “Fall”: freeze-dried meatballs, Pop-Tarts, coffee, wine, ice cream, Chinese food, Red Vines, doughnuts, Coke, 1969 Dom Perignon, and pizza.\n* Stars Hollow celebrations in “Fall”: The Harvest Festival, and Luke and Lorelai’s wedding, which happens on November 5, 2016, according to a sign in town. Quick quibble: Lorelai said the wedding would be on a Sunday, but Nov. 5 was actually a Saturday.\n* An Unmarried Woman , one of the movies Richard took Lorelai to on her 13th birthday, stars Kelly Bishop.\n* Luke went to baseball camp… Scott Patterson was a minor league baseball player for seven years in the ‘80s.\nMore recaps:\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Summer Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Spring Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Winter Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life is streaming on Netflix.",

      "text": "When the sun goes down before 5 p.m., the day often feels over before it even began. Under the cover of afternoon darkness, the screen beckons. Luckily, there are plenty of films and shows recently added to Netflix, Amazon and Hulu to fill such dusk-before-dinner marathons.\nRelated: Netflix: What’s coming and going in December ?\nHere are some suggestions for shows and films to stream this weekend:\n3% (Netflix, November 25) This first Brazilian original for Netflix is a post-apocalyptic thriller in which there are two societies, “Inland” and “Offshore.” The former is marked by devastation, while the latter offers a chance for a better life. To get from one to the other, one must go through “The Process.” As the title of the series suggests, a very small percentage of people make it through.\nChill With Bob Ross : Collection (Netflix, December 1) With his soft pouf of an Afro and his soothing stream of words, which sound more like a protracted lullaby than a tutorial in painting, Ross has mastered the art of relaxation. It’s worth watching whether or not viewers have any interest in canvases. In this collection of 26 episodes, Ross paints winter scenes. Perfect for December streaming.\nRelated: The soothing sounds of Bob Ross\nGirlfriends' Guide to Divorce : Season 2 (Netflix, December 1) Based on the Girlfriends’ Guides series by Vicki Iovine, this show follows a self-help author going through a divorce. It’s due to return for its third season in January, so this is the perfect time to catch up on Season 2.\nFor the Love of Spock (Netflix, December 1) Leonard Nimoy’s son has made a documentary tribute to his late father, who died in February 2015, and to his iconic role as Spock in Star Trek . The release was timed to coincide with the 50th anniversary of the popular franchise.\nRelated: Leonard Nimoy, who defined Star Trek's Spock, dies at 83\nThe Truman Show (Hulu, December 1) Jim Carrey is Truman Burbank, who thinks and looks like a regular guy living in an average suburban town until he starts to notice that something is off. If you’ve managed to avoid learning about the premise and don’t want to spoil the big reveal, don’t watch the trailer below.\nLars and the Real Girl (Amazon, December 1) Ryan Gosling, more frequently cast in the suave leading man role, plays Lars, who one day introduces his friends and family to his girlfriend, a life-sized doll. The movie was nominated for an Oscar for best original screenplay, and Gosling was nominated for a Golden Globe and a Screen Actors Guild Award for his performance.\nThe Lobster (Amazon, December 2) A good pick for those seeking a break from swiping and/or a quirky commentary on modern-day romance, The Lobster is a dystopian film in which single people must enter a hotel and find a partner within 45 days or risk being turned into the animal of their choice. Colin Farrell and Rachel Weisz star.\nRead more from Newsweek.com:\n- Seven shows, films to stream this Thanksgiving weekend on Netflix, Amazon and Hulu\n- Netflix shares soar in worldwide subscriptions boom\n- Leonard Nimoy’s Spock with us still in the White House and Silicon Valley\nRequest Reprint or Submit Correction",

      "text": "Patrick O'Rourke \nDecember 2, 2016 8:12pm \nTo the surprise of many, Netflix launched a new offline viewing mode in its Android and iOS app. \nThe new feature allows Netflix’s subscribers to download a select portion of the streaming platform’s library in order to view it offline at a later date. Unfortunately, offline viewing is only available on iOS and Android and not desktop and the variety of other platforms Netflix is available on. \nWhile using Netflix’s new offline viewing mode on a plane, streetcar or generally anywhere you don’t have a solid internet connection, is relatively easy, some readers have reached out asking MobileSyrup exactly how to use and access the new feature. \nBelow are steps explaining how to use Netflix’s offline viewing mode: \n1. Navigate to Netflix on your Android or iOS device and launch the app. \n2. From Netflix’s main login screen, click the three bars in the top right corner to access the platforms main menu. \n3. Once in this menu, navigate to ‘Available for Download’ to see the range of content currently available to download on Netflix. \n4. Click on a show, like Narcos for example, and press the small arrow with a line under it beside the specific episode. \n5. Once downloaded, head back to the main menu and you’ll find all of your preloaded content in the ‘My Downloads’ section. \nRelated: Netflix claims it already makes ‘substantial’ investments in Canada Skippypaccino \nMy Netflix app is up to date and I don’t see any of this… (using a LG g5) Hello Moto \nIt’ll get to you eventually. App updates are released in batches. Gewurttraminer \nDo people really need instructions for this? It’s pretty simple to the point this article seems to imply readers of this site aren’t too bright at figuring this out. Especially since the app update tells you how.

      "text": "Jon O'Brien for Metro.co.uk Thursday 1 Dec 2016 7:16 am It’s time to put your feet up (Picture: Getty) \nThe festive TV special has become one of the great modern Christmas traditions. \nBut you don’t have to wait until the annual bumper-sized edition of Radio Times hits the shops to decide when to watch your favourites this year. \nIndeed, a monster selection box worth of Christmas viewing choices is currently available to stream on Netflix any time you want. \nYes, you can sit down for festive re-runs of the Royle Family, Gavin and Stacey, Blackadder or Extras long before the big day. \nHere are 12 classics that should get you in the yuletide spirit instantly. A Very Murray Christmas \nIf you like a sprinkling of sardonic wit to go with your festive viewing, then you can’t go wrong with A Very Murray Christmas. \nThe comedian is at his self-effacing best as he invites a whole of A-list celebs (George Clooney, Miley Cyrus, Amy Poehler) to partake in sing-alongs for an affectionate throwback to the holiday TV specials of the 1960s. BoJack Horseman Christmas Special \nThe present-day anthropomorphic world of Netflix’s premier animation takes a backseat in this 2014 special as we get to see a full episode of the lame Full House-style sitcom that launched the titular horseman to fame. \nSabrina’s Christmas Wish might not be the most typical of BoJack Horseman episodes but it’s one of the funniest. \nWe see the washed-up star and slacker friend Todd sit through the cornball storylines and groan-worthy jokes of the show-within-a-show, Horsin’ Around. Outnumbered: The Robbers \nThere are two festive specials on Netflix from the Outnumbered gang, who will return for a new edition this Christmas. \nIf you’ve only got time for one, then make it the 2009 special. \nIn it, the Brockmans are recovering from a recent burglary, Granddad and friend escape from their retirement home and Karen questions her present of a goat sponsorship in typically blunt fashion. The Royle Family: Christmas Special \nThere are two The Royle Family Christmas specials available to stream. \nAlthough the cartoonish antics of 2008’s The New Sofa are undoubtedly funny, they lack the nuances and naturalism that made the early series such a joy. \nThe Christmas 2000 episode is the one to head for. \nIn it, the Royles celebrate Baby David’s first birthday, get increasingly irritated by Emma’s braggadocio parents and welcome the turn-of-the-century couch potato’s ultimate gift – Sky TV. Knowing Me, Knowing Yule (Picture: BBC) \nA potty-mouthed, cross-dressing chef, a giant, exploding Christmas cracker and Simply Red’s Mick Hucknall – these are the unlikely but perfect ingredients for one of the most hilarious festive specials of the 90s. \nKnowing Me, Knowing Yule sees Alan Partridge celebrate the season of goodwill the only way he knows how – by humiliating himself, sabotaging his career and inadvertently causing total and utter carnage. The Office Christmas Special \nSet three years on from the antics of the second series, the two-part The Office Christmas Special sees David Brent struggling to cope with life after minor fame as he revisits his old stomping ground. \nIt isn’t particularly Christmassy, but the sight of Dawn and Tim getting the happy ending we all wanted warms the cockles of your heart far better than any cup of eggnog. Extras: Christmas Special \nThe Office’s Christmas Special may be more widely celebrated, but there’s a case to be put forward that the wrap-up of Extras is Ricky Gervais’s finest festive moment. \nA cursory tale about the fickleness of fame and the importance of real friendships, this 2007 episode concludes with an inspired spoof of Celebrity Big Brother and a rallying speech, which should be prescribed as a cure to anyone addicted to reality TV. Gavin and Stacey: Christmas Special \nLong before he became the most famous talk show host in the world, James Corden was, of course, the co-writer and co-star of BBC Three’s biggest crossover hit, Gavin and Stacey. \nThis 2008 special sustains the high quality of the show’s three series as the Wests head down to Essex to spend the big day with the Shipmans and Gavin reveals his big move to Wales, Dave proposes to Nessa, and we come within a whisker of finding out about Jason and Bryn’s big fishing trip secret. Him and Her: The Christmas Special \nThe lazy antics of The Royle Family look positively energetic compared to those of Becky and Steve, aka the slovenly central couple in perhaps this decade’s most under-rated sitcom. \nThe show, in which pretty much nothing actually happens, broke the mould for its 2012 festive special as Steve’s absent father makes a surprise visit. \nBut some things still stay the same as the brilliantly vile Laura terrorises the house with her karaoke machine and ruins Shelly’s son’s Christmas forever. Cuckoo: Christmas Special \nThe first series of BBC Three’s Cuckoo felt a bit too try-hard, but unexpectedly found its groove when Taylor Lautner replaced Andy Samberg as the show’s American lead. \nThe Twilight star brings an appealing naive charm as the original Cuckoo’s long-lost son. \nThis 2014 Christmas special makes the most of his talents as his slightly icky relationship with stepmum Rachel reaches a new level. Blackadder’s Christmas Carol \nCharles Dickens’ A Christmas Carol has been referenced in numerous Christmas specials over the years, but few have done it as cleverly or as wittily as Ben Elton and Richard Curtis in their classic period comedy. \nThis stand-alone 1988 episode, which revisits several Blackadder favourites, reinvents Ebenezer Scrooge as the nicest man in England to provide a surreal new spin on a story we’ve all heard countless times before. Black Mirror: White Christmas \nIf jolly holiday affairs aren’t your thing, then Charlie Brooker’s nightmarish White Christmas is the festive special for you. \nA chilling look into the future of artificial intelligence, dating apps and social media, this star-studded feature-length episode encompasses everything from murder and torture to the accidental death of a young girl, while also ruining Wizzard’s I Wish It Could Be Christmas Everyday for all eternity. Further Christmas viewing \nIf you want more festive action then there are several Christmas-themed ‘normal’ episodes of Arrested Development, It’s Always Sunny In Philadelphia, Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, My Crazy Ex-Girlfriend and Community that are also worth checking out. \nA Moody Family Christmas, the acclaimed Australian comedy that follows a dysfunctional family over six different Christmas days, is also available to watch from December 1.

      "title": "Captive: Netflix's big-budget answer to Crimewatch | Television & radio",
      "text": "Back in September, Netflix announced a long-term plan to fill half of its catalogue with original programming. This perhaps explains its feverish efforts in recent years to make big-budget versions of every TV format under the sun – with the possible exceptions of home shopping and crime scene re-enactment. However, the latter arrives on the platform on Friday courtesy of Captive , a slick docuseries that does for a string of high-stakes false imprisonments what Crimewatch does for armed robberies in Penge.\nAcross eight episodes, the show revisits hostage-takings in eight countries from Brazil to Chechnya to Yemen, using first-hand interviews, archival footage and glossy reconstructions to piece together precise accounts of events often shrouded in confusion and terror. At first, it’s not clear what Captive hopes to achieve beyond raising the audience’s collective heart rate but, over time, a few factors begin to elevate the show beyond its superficial sales pitch as a sleek but repetitive odyssey through the “List of hostage crises” Wikipedia entry.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest \nMost remarkably, episodes regularly secure the participation of both victims and perpetrators, granting the audience a more nuanced understanding of events by allowing them to observe from two angles. In one episode detailing a 1993 Ohio prison riot in which 450 inmates turned the tables on their guards, a prisoner recalls how he located and studied the jail’s hostage negotiation manual, allowing him to work to the same handbook as police in the subsequent stand-off.\nCaptive allows these subjects to speak for themselves, rather than prodding them for details. It’s an approach that creates empathy with victims, but often provokes swaggering bravado in their captors, meaning little is revealed about the latter group. “Snitches get ditches,” says one Ohio inmate, now released and wearing a trilby, in a moment the show plays for edgy menace. If there’s more to his words than macho posturing, Captive isn’t interested in finding out.\nLikewise, the show’s desire to both ratchet tension and probe for meaning often leaves it scrambling for cod philosophy in its closing minutes. Several episodes end with victims considering the humanity they share with their tormentors, a lofty idea unearned by a show more interested in milking hostage situations for their innate horror. This contradiction is nothing new: it’s inherent in every unsparing Crimewatch dramatisation of a Northampton pensioner’s murder that claims a higher moral calling. Maybe this is one TV format even Netflix can’t salvage.",

      "text": "Diehard fans may have flocked to the Netflix’s “ Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life ,” for the quips, the pop culture references and all the coffee. However, it’s the revival’s quieter, more solemn moments that deserve true praise ― particularly when it comes to therapy.\nIn real life, seeking psychological support is often viewed as an unsavory byproduct of “losing your mind” rather than treating a very common health condition. Research even shows that many people with mental health issues avoid going to a therapist because they’re afraid of being judged or shamed by peers.\nBut in Stars Hollow, therapy is just a natural part of grief. And it’s presented in the most nonchalant and obvious way ― just as it should be.\nNetflix Lorelai (left) and Emily see a therapist to work through their grief and rocky relationship in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\" During the first episode of the four-part series, Lorelai Gilmore recommends that her mother Emily sees someone to help process the loss of her husband Richard:\n“I’m not crazy,” Emily retorts at the suggestion.\n“No, you’re in pain,” Lorelai argues. “This is uncharted territory. If it might help, what’s the harm?”\nEmily concedes and the show then chronicles her ― and eventually also Lorelai’s ― journey through therapy as they talk about their grief over Richard’s death and their tumultuous mother-daughter relationship.\nIt’s a powerful subplot of the revival that deserves attention. The show not only shines a light on therapy, it normalizes it.\nHighlighting stigma and mental health access issues Emily’s initial and instinctual reaction to therapy is reflective of the cultural attitude toward mental health: That seeking support is synonymous with “crazy.”\nEven though it’s this exact mindset that needs to be eradicated, it’s critical that it also gets airtime. That way it can also be shut down, according to Srijan Sen, a professor at the University of Michigan Depression Center.\n“Because of the stigma in some parts of our society, many people don’t realize how many of their friends, colleagues and family have received therapy,” Sen told The Huffington Post. “TV shows can start conversations and create an environment where people feel comfortable talking about therapy.”\nTV shows can start conversations and create an environment where people feel comfortable talking about therapy. Srijan Sen, University of Michigan Depression Center Of course, the revival’s portrayal of mental health help didn’t come without other pitfalls. Lorelai and Emily’s therapist, Claudia, wasn’t overly stellar at her job. Aside from one interjection to let the duo know that \"anything is allowed\" in therapy aside from \"physical confrontation\" (which is true), she remained mostly silent except for when she announced that their time was up. Viewers don't really get to see how she interacts with the pair as her clients.\nLorelai also has an awkward, out-of-office encounter with Claudia, who is trying out for the town musical Lorelai is helping to oversee. It could be argued that this is a peril of living in a small city like Stars Hollow ― and an issue that also presents itself in real life.\nResearch shows there’s a large shortage of mental health providers , specifically outside of cities. This leaves little options for people seeking support (and puts a person in a position where they may, say, have a therapist who is also involved in their musical theater production).\n“Access to mental health professionals is a huge problem and it is exacerbated because providers tend to be concentrated in cities,” Sen explained. “There are some evidence-based alternatives to in-person therapy such as telepsychiatry and web-based and mobile technology tools but we really need to get more professionals.”\nWhy this representation ultimately matters Therapy’s exposure in pop culture is critical to dismantling the misconceptions people have about seeking mental health support.\n“When it is a TV character that you connect with, seeing them engage in therapy and benefit from the experience can really help,” Sen said. “TV shows can really help to convey how common these problems are and help viewers who may be suffering to recognize symptoms, feel less alone and hopefully get help.”\nWhen it is a TV character that you connect with, seeing them engage in therapy and benefit from the experience can really help. Approximately one in five American adults will experience a mental health issue in a given year. That number increases when you factor in kids and young adults . The fact is that psychological conditions ― whether acute or chronic ― are strikingly common. It’s only fitting that TV represents that.\nAnd, bottom line, accurate pop culture portrayals can send the message that seeing a mental health professional is just as critical as seeing a primary care doctor.\n“Taking care of your mind is just as important as taking care of your body,” Sen said.\nThe Gilmores would probably agree.\nAlso on HuffPost Celebrities On Mental Health In 2016 Celebrities On Mental Health In 2016 1 of 13 Kristen Bell Share this slide:\nGetty ImagesHuffPost More: Endeavor Stronger Together Gilmore Girls Therapy Gilmore Girls Revival Suggest a correction LIFESTYLE 1.55 M 329 ",

      "title": "The Netflix Tech Blog: More Efficient Mobile Encodes for Netflix Downloads",
      "text": "Thursday, December 1, 2016 More Efficient Mobile Encodes for Netflix Downloads Last January, Netflix launched globally, reaching many new members in 130 countries around the world. In many of these countries, people access the internet primarily using cellular networks or still-developing broadband infrastructure. Although we have made strides in delivering the same or better video quality with less bits (for example, with per-title encode optimization ), further innovation is required to improve video quality over low-bandwidth unreliable networks. In this blog post, we summarize our recent work on generating more efficient video encodes, especially targeted towards low-bandwidth Internet connections. We refer to these new bitstreams as our mobile encodes. Our first use case for these streams is the recently launched downloads feature on Android and iOS. What’s new about our mobile encodes We are introducing two new types of mobile encodes - AVCHi-Mobile and VP9-Mobile . The enhancements in the new bitstreams fall into three categories: (1) new video compression formats, (2) more optimal encoder settings, and (3) per-chunk bitrate optimization. All the changes combined result in better video quality for the same bitrate compared to our current streams ( AVCMain ). New compression formats Many Netflix-ready devices receive streams which are encoded using the H.264/AVC Main profile (AVCMain). This is a widely-used video compression format, with ubiquitous decoder support on web browsers, TVs, mobile devices, and other consumer devices . However, newer formats are available that offer more sophisticated video coding tools. For our mobile bitstreams we adopt two compression formats: H.264/AVC High profile and VP9 (profile 0). Similar to Main profile, the High profile of H.264/AVC enjoys broad decoder support. VP9, a royalty-free format developed by Google, is supported on the majority of Android devices, Chrome, and a growing number of consumer devices. High profile of H.264/AVC shares the general architecture of H.264/AVC Main profile and among other features, offers other tools that increase compression efficiency. The tools from High profile that are relevant to our use case are: 8x8 transforms and Intra 8x8 prediction Quantization scaling matrices Separate Cb and Cr control VP9 has a number of tools which bring improvements in compression efficiency over H.264/AVC, including: Motion-predicted blocks of sizes up to 64×64 1/8th pel motion vectors Three switchable 8-tap subpixel interpolation filters Better coding of motion vectors Larger discrete cosine transforms (DCT, 16×16, and 32×32) Asymmetric discrete sine transform (ADST) Loop filtering adapted to new block sizes Segmentation maps More optimal encoder settings Apart from using new coding formats, optimizing encoder settings allows us to further improve compression efficiency. Examples of improved encoder settings are as follows: Increased random access picture period: This parameter trades off encoding efficiency with granularity of random access points. More consecutive B-frames or longer Alt-ref distance: Allowing the encoder to flexibly choose more B-frames in H.264/AVC or longer distance between Alt-ref frames in VP9 can be beneficial, especially for slowly changing scenes. Larger motion search range: Results in better motion prediction and fewer intra-coded blocks. More exhaustive mode evaluation: Allows an encoder to evaluate more encoding options at the expense of compute time. Per-chunk encode optimization In our parallel encoding pipeline , the video source is split up into a number of chunks, each of which is processed and encoded independently. For our AVCMain encodes, we analyze the video source complexity to select bitrates and resolutions optimized for that title . Whereas our AVCMain encodes use the same average bitrate for each chunk in a title, the mobile encodes optimize the bitrate for each individual chunk based on its complexity (in terms of motion, detail, film grain, texture, etc). This reduces quality fluctuations between the chunks and avoids over-allocating bits to chunks with less complex content. Video compression results In this section, we evaluate the compression performance of our new mobile encodes. The following configurations are compared: AVCMain: Our existing H.264/AVC Main profile encodes, using per-title optimization, serve a s a n c h o r f o r t h e c o m p a r i s o n. AVCHi-Mobile: H.264/AVC High profile encodes using more optimal encoder settings and per-chunk encoding. VP9-Mobile: VP9 encodes using more optimal encoder settings and per-chunk encoding. The results were obtained on a sample of 600 full-length popular movies or TV episodes with 1080p source resolution (which adds up to about 85 million frames). We encode multiple quality points (with different resolutions), to account for different bandwidth conditions of our members. In our tests, we calculate PSNR and VMAF to measure video quality. The metrics are computed after scaling the decoded videos to the original 1080p source resolution. To compare the average compression efficiency improvement, we use Bjontegaard-delta rate (BD-rate), a measure widely used in video compression. BD-rate indicates the average change in bitrate that is needed for a tested configuration to achieve the same quality as the anchor. The metric is calculated over a range of bitrate-quality points and interpolates between them to get an estimate of the relative performance of two configurations. The graph below illustrates the results of the comparison. The bars represent BD-rate gains, and higher percentages indicate larger bitrate savings.The AVCHi-Mobile streams can deliver the same video quality at 15% lower bitrate according to PSNR and at 19% lower bitrate according to VMAF. The VP9-Mobile streams show more gains and can deliver an average of 36% bitrate savings according to PSNR and VMAF. This demonstrates that using the new mobile encodes requires significantly less bitrate for the same quality. Viewing it another way, members can now receive better quality streams for the same bitrate. This is especially relevant for members with slow or expensive internet connectivity. The graph below illustrates the average quality (in terms of VMAF) at different available bit budgets for the video bitstream. For example, at 1 Mbps, our AVCHi-Mobile and VP9-Mobile streams show an average VMAF increase of 7 and 10, respectively, over AVC-Main. These gains represent noticeably better visual quality for the mobile streams. How can I watch with the new mobile encodes? Last month, we started re-encoding our catalog to generate the new mobile bitstreams and the effort is ongoing. The mobile encodes are being used in the brand new downloads feature. In the near future, we will also use these new bitstreams for mobile streaming to broaden the benefit for Netflix members, no matter how they’re watching.

      "text": "A team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada have developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not. Machine learning - a powerful tool used for a variety of tasks in modern life, from Google to Netflix - can help scientists determine whether planetary systems are stable or not, a new study has found.\nMachine learning is used in fraud detection and sorting spam in Google and in making movie recommendations on Netflix. Now, a team of researchers from the University of Toronto Scarborough in Canada have developed a novel approach in using it to determine whether planetary systems are stable or not.\n\"Machine learning offers a powerful way to tackle a problem in astrophysics, and that's predicting whether planetary systems are stable,\" said Dan Tamayo, postdoctoral fellow in the Centre for Planetary Science at U of T Scarborough.\nMachine learning is a form of artificial intelligence that gives computers the ability to learn without having to be constantly programmed for a specific task. The benefit is that it can teach computers to learn and change when exposed to new data, not to mention it's also very efficient. The method developed by Tamayo and his team is 1,000 times faster than traditional methods in predicting stability.\n\"In the past we've been hamstrung in trying to figure out whether planetary systems are stable by methods that couldn't handle the amount of data we were throwing at it,\" he said.\nIt is important to know whether planetary systems are stable or not because it can tell us a great deal about how these systems formed. It can also offer valuable new information about exoplanets that is not offered by current methods of observation.\nThere are several current methods of detecting exoplanets that provide information such as the size of the planet and its orbital period, but they may not provide the planet's mass or how elliptical their orbit is, which are all factors that affect stability, noted Tamayo.\n\"What's encouraging is that our findings tell us that investing weeks of computation to train machine learning models is worth it because not only is this tool accurate, it also works much faster,\" he added.\nIt may also come in handy when analysing data from NASA's Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS) set to launch next year. The two-year mission will focus on discovering new exoplanets by focusing on the brightest stars near our solar system.\n\"It could be a useful tool because predicting stability would allow us to learn more about the system, from the upper limits of mass to the eccentricities of these planets,\" said Tamayo.",

      "text": "October 10, 2014 | 09:33AM PT Streaming titles available in the format include 'The Blacklist,''Breaking Bad' and 'House of Cards' \nNetflix offers only a handful of titles in eye-popping Ultra HD — including the first season of NBC’s “The Blacklist” — but to watch them, subscribers will have to pay for its most expensive service tier. \nNew Netflix members who want access to Ultra HD must sign up for the “family” plan at $11.99 monthly, which allows simultaneous streaming of up to four programs. Previously, Netflix offered 4K content to subs of its standard plan, now $8.99 per month for new customers, which allows for two HD streams. \n“We decided to move 4K UHD video into our four-stream plan for new members who sign up and care about the highest-quality video Netflix offers,” a Netflix spokesman said. “We have a modest and growing catalog of titles in 4K, including ‘House of Cards,’‘Breaking Bad,’‘The Blacklist’ and a slate of upcoming Netflix original series.” \nAccording to Netflix, the reason for the change was that producing and acquiring 4K content costs more that conventional HD, so it has repositioned Ultra HD as a premium offering. \nThe Ultra HD price change went into effect Aug. 12. Early adopters of 4K technology who currently are Netflix members were grandfathered indefinitely under their existing price plan. \nIn addition to all 62 episodes of “Breaking Bad” and “House of Cards” season two, Netflix’s Ultra HD lineup in the U.S. includes “Smurfs 2,” “Ghostbusters,” “Ghostbusters 2″ and the four-part “Moving Art” nature documentary series. \nThe subscription VOD company doesn’t disclose how many selections it offers in Ultra HD format, which provides four times the resolution of standard HD and richer color palette. The 4K content is available on select models of Ultra HD TVs from LG, Samsung, Sony and Vizio, and Netflix subs with compatible sets will see an additional row displaying 4K TV shows and movies in their on-screen menus. \nIn addition to paying more for Netflix service, users will need a beefy broadband connection as well: The streamer recommends an Internet connection speed of at least 25 megabits per second downstream to watch Ultra HD content. \nNetflix’s rate change for Ultra HD content was reported earlier by HD Guru .",

      "text": "\nAs if answering a challenge from Netflix, Marvel Studios, and everyone involved with the programming that will culminate in the 2017 release of Marvel’s The Defenders , The CW and DC Comics brought together Supergirl , The Flash , Arrow and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow for a huge “Heroes vs. Aliens” four-part crossover that included extra-terrestrials, time travel and an epic inter-dimensional battle for the safety of all metahumans on Earth.\nAfter Melissa Benoist and Grant Gustin successfully teamed-up for a short crossover between Supergirl and The Flash last season — and Supergirl was moved from CBS to The CW after its freshman season and introduced Superman to the mix — fans were incredibly anxious for a huge crossover that might look something like the Justice League. After all, over the years in the pages of DC Comics, different iterations of the Justice League have included the likes of Superman, Supergirl, Green Arrow, The Flash (both Barry Allen and Wally West), Martian Manhunter, Atom, Hawkman, Hawkgirl, Black Canary, Firestorm, Guardian, Mon-El and Maxwell Lord — all of whom have been introduced to one or more of the DCTV programs on The CW.\nHeroes vs. Aliens [Image by The CW] For fans who loved the four-part series, an extra bit of good news was given near the conclusion of the story on Thursday’s episode of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow . After their epic showdown with a species of space creatures known only as the Destroyers, the tech-savvy Cisco (Flash’s friend from STAR Labs in Central City) gave Supergirl a device that will allow for crossover episodes as needed by The CW.\nHeroes vs. Aliens — Crossover Recap Existing on a completely different version of Earth than The Flash , Arrow , and the Legends of Tomorrow , the crossover began on Supergirl at the end of “Medusa,” the eighth episode of Season 2. After seeing a few inexplicable sites that looked suspiciously like a portal to another dimension, The Flash and Cisco Ramon showed up in Kara Danvers’ apartment in the final minutes of the show. Since The Flash helped Supergirl last season, it was time for the Kryptonian expatriate to return the favor.\nThe next night, on the eighth episode of The Flash , Season 3 (“Invasion!”), Supergirl was introduced to Green Arrow and the Legends for the first time on The CW. After an alien ship crashes in downtown Central City, the folks at STAR Labs realize that a threat is upon them. As the de facto leader, Barry rounds up Oliver Queen and the time-traveling Legends. Along with Cisco, he then travels to Earth-38 to recruit Supergirl. As the battle ensues, Supergirl and the Legends are brainwashed by the aliens to attack The Flash and Green Arrow. While they break free of the mind-control before any fellow heroes are seriously injured, the non-metahuman heroes (Green Arrow, Atom, Black Canary, John Diggle and Thea) are abducted by the aliens as part two of the crossover concludes.\nOn Wednesday night, part three of the crossover aired as Season 5, episode eight of Arrow (also titled “Invasion!”). With Oliver and the others still on the alien spacecraft, Cisco and Felicity meet up with Arrow’s new recruits to set up a plan to save the day. While in a shared hallucinogenic dream-state on the alien ship, the good guys must band together to dream-fight Deathstroke, Malcolm Merlyn and Damien Darhk (which they do successfully). As the episode concludes, the entire Arrow crew breaks free from the aliens and we find out that the Destroyers are building a very scary weapon that will soon be unleashed on Earth.\nThe crossover series finale came on Thursday night, as the seventh episode of Season 2 of DC’s Legends of Tomorrow , which was also called “Invasion!” As the Legends discover (by traveling back to the 1950s to interrogate a Destroyer after their first visit to planet Earth), the aliens want to rid Earth of its metahumans, as they pose a threat to humanity and alien life on other planets. Things with the Destroyers remained peaceful until Barry’s time-traveling created the Flashpoint, which the aliens saw as a threat. Refusing to sacrifice the life of The Flash to guarantee the safety of the rest of the metahumans, the heroes versus aliens war ensues on Earth-1, eventually causing the Destroyers to retreat. Earth — and all of its metahumans — were saved from the alien invasion.\nDon't miss the conclusion of #DCWeek's 4 night crossover event, TONIGHT at 8/7c on The CW! Check out our story for a BTS look! \nA photo posted by The CW (@thecw) on Dec 1, 2016 at 2:02pm PST \n\nAfter Barry, Oliver and Kara celebrate their victory with a group hug, Cisco interrupts to give Kara a token of appreciation:\n“It’s an intra-dimensional extrapolator… it creates small breeches so you can use it to cross over to our universe any time you need to.”\nAnd to make sure that The CW has a way of cross-promoting these shows shy of doing an all-out crossover, Cisco tells Kara about another trick the handheld gadget can perform.\n“I also included communication functionality. So, if you ever need any help, you can always contact the team.”\nWhile the Heroes vs. Aliens story arc is now complete, Supergirl’s new gadget almost guarantees that we’ll see Superman’s cousin (and possibly Superman himself!) making more visits to Earth-1, and probably reaching out for advice at least once or twice each season.\nRELATED REPORTS BY THE INQUISITR \nDCTV: Supergirl Season 2 Premiere Recap — Superman And 3 Other DC Comics Characters Debut On The CW 10 Marvel Comics Characters That Would Make A Great New X-Men TV Series DCTV: New Arrow Season 5 Trailer — How Will The Flashpoint Change Arrow , The Flash , LOT , And Supergirl ?

Woman Crush Wednesday: 5 TV Super Heroines Or Villains Who Will Steal Your Heart Heroes vs. Aliens — Crossover Ratings As reported by TV Line , all four episodes of The CW’s DC Comics crossover gave the shows a big boost in the ratings. The least significant increase came for Supergirl , whose 3.5 million viewers was a 33 percent increase. The Flash had more viewers than any other “Invasion!” episode, with 4.2 million representing a 40 percent uptick. Arrow had the biggest increase in terms of percentage, with 3.5 million viewers being a jump of 84 percent. Finally, Legends of Tomorrow had 3.33 million viewers, an increase of 80 percent.\nThe big ratings and positive reviews for “Heroes vs. Aliens” is good news for fans who are hoping to see more. Now that the crews from Star City and the Waverider know about Flashpoint and the big changes Barry caused in their own lives, it makes sense that the casts of the three shows will see more of each other in the near future.\nWhere to Watch All four DCTV shows air weekly on The CW at 8/7c. New episodes of Supergirl air on Mondays. The Flash airs on Tuesday nights, Arrow on Wednesdays and DC’s Legends of Tomorrow on Thursdays. Recent episodes of all of these shows can be streamed on The CW’s website, while prior seasons can be streamed via Netflix.\nAll four parts of the “Heroes vs. Aliens” crossover can be streamed on The CW’s website .\n[Featured Image by Alberto E.

      "text": "Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends \nBoth Netflix and Amazon have been offering select content in 4K Ultra HD for quite some time now and comparatively, Hulu has been slow to follow. Now the streaming service has finally jumped on the 4K bandwagon , as The Verge reports, but there isn’t a wealth of content at launch, and ways to watch are limited. \nAs usual, you’ll need to make sure that you have a 4K-ready TV and fast enough internet to support a 4K stream — Hulu says it requires a minimum of 13 megabits per second for 4K streaming — but you’ll also need supported hardware. Right now, only two devices are capable of streaming 4K from Hulu: the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S game consoles. \nMore : Hulu’s two new deals bring its internet TV service close than ever \nIf you’re fortunate enough to have the right hardware to watch Hulu’s new 4K streams, you’ll also find content is limited. The bulk of available content right now consists of Hulu original series like 11.22.63 , The Path, Chance, and Shut Eye. If you’re a fan of Hulu’s original programming, this is great, but otherwise the offerings seem somewhat lackluster. Unless, that is, you’re a James Bond fan. \nIn addition to Hulu originals, a total of 20 Bond films from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer catalog are available in 4K. This includes the recent Spectre, and classics like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Dr. No , among others. \nThough there isn’t much here at the start, it’s telling that Hulu has finally entered the 4K game at all. It’s a fairly safe bet that more content will be available sooner rather than later, and it shouldn’t be too long before the service offers 4K content on other devices as well. Whether HDR (high dynamic range) content is on the way as well is currently unknown, but with both Netflix and Amazon supporting it, it seems likely that Hulu would like to offer it eventually.

Netflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016. (AP Photo/Elise Amendola, File) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option announced Wednesday gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading. Get breaking news sent instantly to your inbox Sign Up! QCTimes.com Breaking News   \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "\n\nLooking around for information about Spectral , you’ll notice that the film was slated to be released in theaters this summer. That usually is a poor sign for a film, but it has a new home on Netflix as t heir next original release and the trailer makes it seem like it is right where it was always meant to be. \nThe film apparently had a long road to release according to Slashfilm , with the completed film getting shelved by Universal until it was slated for release this summer. Then it fell off again before ending up in front of Netflix to become their next film. And while all of that sounds like a recipe for a box office bomb, it might be fine for a movie that you can easily watch from the comfort of your own living room. Slashfilm agrees with that and shares the plot for the film : \nSpectral centers on an engineer who joins forces with a Special Ops team after mysterious phantoms code-named Spectral begin killing people in a battle-scarred city. The film boasts weaponry by Weta Workshop and VFX by Weta Digital, and a score by Junkie XL (Mad Max: Fury Road).\n\nOther sites seem to compare it to Black Hawk Down with ghosts, but I would rather call it a grittier version of Ghostbusters . Instead of people being slimed or scared senseless, we have soldiers in the streets being murdered by ghosts and trying to shoot them with American military superiority. It’s basically the reboot from this summer, so I can understand why they didn’t put it in theaters. That or Universal just figured people were not interested in movies about ghosts. \nEither way, Spectral will hit Netflix on December 9th and you can judge for yourself. It seems like the kind of b-movie fun that is perfect for a quick Netflix watch in the afternoon or as a fix at midnight on a Saturday. \n(Via Slashfilm / Netflix )\n",

Every year on January 1st, Netflix normally renews and in some cases don’t renew a lot of their content on Netflix. \nJust a quick recap of what we’ve lost in recent months from the Netflix library. Everybody Loves Raymond was a big loss recently as well as NBC shows such as Heroes as well as a bunch of movies added from the Summer Of Movies promotion Netflix ran during the summer. \nIt’s likely we’ll get some great new additions, though so keep an eye out for our end of year previews throughout this month. \nAs always, we’ll get titles around 30 days before they’re due to expire plus a complete list which gets given to us by Netflix towards the end of the month.

      "text": "10 Must-See Movies to Netflix Now Font Resize Visits: 30 \nMost films have already been released for 2010, but I believed I would take time for you to highlight ten little-seen gems that you could get right now off Netflix. You are going to save revenue and discover some terrific films when you use my list to fill your queue. Get additional details about www.newrelease.stream \n10) Mysterious Skin- My favorite director (Gregg Araki) and his finest movie ever. Mysterious Skin is about two boys linked together by a horrible childhood trauma. At turns graphic, disturbing, but filled with beauty and hope it really is among the list of best films with the decade. Joseph Gordon Leavitt (no longer that kid from 3rd Rock in the Sun) is nothing at all short of astounding. \n9) Dead Man's Shoes- Paddy Considine is great in this brutal revenge drama from director Shane Meadows. The film is about a brother's quest for revenge just after his mentally challenged brother is brutalized by some Midlands thugs inside the squalid UK countryside. Some critics mistakenly referred to as this an art-house torture po rn, but it really is light years much better and much more compelling than anything the overrated Eli Roth could ever come up with. \n8) Frailty-Frailty is really a horror gem starring and directed by Bill Paxton. A grisly tale of a seemingly loving father who believes he and his sons are the hands of God. He searches out men and women he believes to be demons and cuts them to pieces. Fine period detail and acting, particularly in the young boys, Frailty is about religious devotion run amok and turned into madness. A should see. \n7) In Bruges - In Bruges has the top screenplay of final year and some on the finest acting of Collin Farrell's career. Clever and brutal, funny but incredibly violent, it's the film Guy Ritchie keeps trying to make, and one particular that keeps eluding him. Among the list of finest films of final year. \n6) Smiley Face - Director Gregg Araki's final film is a very funny stoner comedy starring the awesome Anna Faris. Sublimely silly movie that went direct to DVD, although it's substantially funnier than quite a few comedies that get theatrical releases today. \n5) Rules of Attraction - A sharp and sharply funny appear at some nasty spoiled college students courtesy of author Bret Easton Ellis and writer/director Roger Avary. This can be almost certainly the best of the Ellis film adaptions to date (American Psycho having a terrific Christian Bale is yet another ought to see) and despite its lothsome characters, I loved each and every shocking and entertainig moment on the film. \n4) Sex Drive - The teen sex comedy gets updated with hilarious results. Amazingly this was a box workplace dud however it was very easily the funniest film of last year. The leads are likable and amusing and James Marsden all but steals the entire movie because the homophobic older brother bully character. Seth Green lends sturdy assistance as a sarcastic and smarmy Amish know it all. RUMPSRINGA! \n3) Mirror Mask- Alice in Wonderland meets The Wizard of Oz by way of Neil Gaiman. MirrorMask can be a thrilling and well-acted fantasy film meant for teens and adults. The worlds produced are wholly original and star Stephenie Leonidas is best as the punky Emo goth who desires to run away from her creepy circus existence and gets more than she ever bargained for. \n2) Cashback - Original and visually stunning comedy/drama about a young man who breaks up with his fairly girlfriend and learns he has the capacity to cease time. His insomnia produces a opportunity for him to paint random subjects with time frozen and also the film may very well be creepy within the incorrect hands, ends up getting delightful and anything worth seeking out. All props go to the director for producing a low-budget feature appear like a thing having a larger spending budget. \n1) This is England - Writer/director Shane Meadows returns with an autobiographical look at his childhood and his alliance with a young gang of skinhead thugs. Well-acted, at times tough to watch, and thoroughly compelling, That is England may be in regards to the UK but its themes of racial intolerance and hatred could take location anyplace in any nation at any time. It could have already been called This is America. The movie is brilliant, blistering stuff.",

      "text": "How Netflix Keeps Downloads From Eating Up All Your Phone Storage Updated: December 2, 2016 — 6:08 PM EST Share Variety Media, LLC \nBy Janko Roettgers \nLOS ANGELES (Variety.com) - When Netflix introduced the ability to download content onto mobile devices for offline viewing earlier this week, it also debuted a few technical tweaks to make sure that those downloaded episodes of \"Black Mirror\" won't eat up all of your phone's storage. Eventually, Netflix wants to use the same technologies to optimize streaming to mobile devices as well. \nOne of the biggest differences between shows you download and shows you stream on Netflix is the video format, or codec, the company is using. For streaming, Netflix has been using H.264/AVC almost exclusively. However, users who download Netflix shows to most Android devices instead receive content encoded with VP9 -- an open source video codec developed by Google that uses a bunch of advanced encoding tricks to deliver the same video quality with significantly less data. \nThe problem with VP9 is that it isn't supported by everyone in the industry. Given Google's backing, it obviously runs on Android and in the company's Chrome browser, and a growing number of consumer electronics devices are capable of playing VP9 videos as well. iPhones, however, can't and Apple has given no indication that it plans to support VP9 any time soon. \nRelated Inside Netflix's Plan to Boost Streaming Quality and Unclog the Internet (Exclusive) \nThat's why Netflix is also encoding its downloadable videos with a different flavor of H.264/AVC, which is also known as a different profile. (For the technically inclined: Netflix's streams are encoded with H.264/AVC Main, whereas its downloads come in H.264/AVC High. The company shared more details on its tech blog this week.) This isn't quite as effective as using VP9, but still allows Netflix to shave off some bits and shrink down file sizes. \nBut Netflix didn't just switch its codecs. The company's encoding team also realized that different scenes in different movies require vastly different amounts of data. An action scene with a lot of visual noise contains a lot more visual information than a scenic shot of a blue sky, and animated movies in general are much easier to encode than live-action films. \nNetflix first started to account for these visual differences last year, when it began to tweak its encoding settings for each and every title -- an approach that helped the company to deliver better-looking streams to users with slower internet connections while saving up to 20% of data. \nRelated Here Are the Movies and TV Shows You Can Watch Offline on Netflix \nFor its new download option, the company is taking the idea one step further: Instead of changing these settings per title, Netflix is cutting each and every video into one-to-three-minute-long chunks. Computers then analyze the visual complexity of each and every of these clips, and encode with settings that are optimized for its visual complexity. \nThe resulting bandwidth savings are significant: Compared to the encoding tech Netflix uses for streaming, using this chunking method in combination with the new VP9 codec saves around 36% of bandwidth on average for videos that look the same to the human eye. \nVideos encoded with H.264/AVC High still use up to 19% less bandwidth on average. In other words: iPhone users may be able to save five episodes of \"Black Mirror\" with the same amount of space on their phone that would have been occupied by four episodes with Netflix's existing technology. \nHowever, optimizing encoding of videos isn't just about saving space on your phone, or making sure you don't go above your monthly data cap. The same tech can also be used to deliver better-looking videos at the same file size. That's why Netflix plans to bring both chunk-based encoding as well as new encoders to mobile streaming in the coming months as well.

      "text": "hulu launches k streaming spectre snow scene More Both Netflix and Amazon have been offering select content in 4K Ultra HD for quite some time now and comparatively, Hulu has been slow to follow. Now the streaming service has finally jumped on the 4K bandwagon , as The Verge reports, but there isn’t a wealth of content at launch, and ways to watch are limited.\nAs usual, you’ll need to make sure that you have a 4K-ready TV and fast enough internet to support a 4K stream — Hulu says it requires a minimum of 13 megabits per second for 4K streaming — but you’ll also need supported hardware. Right now, only two devices are capable of streaming 4K from Hulu: the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S game consoles.\nMore : Hulu’s two new deals bring its internet TV service close than ever\nIf you’re fortunate enough to have the right hardware to watch Hulu’s new 4K streams, you’ll also find content is limited. The bulk of available content right now consists of Hulu original series like 11.22.63 , The Path, Chance, and Shut Eye. If you’re a fan of Hulu’s original programming, this is great, but otherwise the offerings seem somewhat lackluster. Unless, that is, you’re a James Bond fan.\nIn addition to Hulu originals, a total of 20 Bond films from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer catalog are available in 4K. This includes the recent Spectre, and classics like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Dr. No , among others.\nThough there isn’t much here at the start, it’s telling that Hulu has finally entered the 4K game at all. It’s a fairly safe bet that more content will be available sooner rather than later, and it shouldn’t be too long before the service offers 4K content on other devices as well. Whether HDR (high dynamic range) content is on the way as well is currently unknown, but with both Netflix and Amazon supporting it, it seems likely that Hulu would like to offer it eventually.\nGot a new 4K UHD TV? Here’s where to go to start watching the best 4K content right now What sort of hardware does your PC need to play games at 4K resolution?",

      "text": "Open Web development -- 2 2 Project Description \nNetflix is a global provider for streaming movies and TV series; it has over 75 million subscribers as of 2016. Netflix started as an American DVD-by-mail service in 1998, and began streaming in 2007. Netflix expanded with streaming services to Canada in 2010 and now serves over 190 countries with streaming services. Netflix now produces hundreds of hours of original programming around the world. \n​Customers can have many subscriptions and a subscription is assigned to one customer. A subscription has a subscription number and date. There are only two types of subscriptions that Netflix offers, first there is an All-In subscription which has access to all the contents offered by the company, and there is a TV-Only subscriptions which has access only to TV series. TV-Only subscription store information about movie-offer-type which is a type of an offer that reduces the cost of switching to All-In subscription depending on the hours watched by the customer (the more hours a customer watch, the more discount he will receive), it is not required to store this information for the All-In subscriptions. Also, only authorized customers can stream contents from the company. \n​The system needs to store the following information about each content: a title, year and description. There are only two types of contents, movies and TV-Series. A movie has an additional information which is genre and TV-Series has a seasons count. Contents are stored in several servers and a server can contain several contents to improve streaming performance. Maintenance of the servers is done every month as well as when there is a need of a maintenance. The servers should be up and running 24/7. \n​The contents are acquired from different content providers. All content providers have unique identifiers and names. There are only two types of content providers. First, a studio can provide contents and the system needs to store information about the credentials that the studio has. Second, an independent content makers can provide contents and the system needs to store the independent content maker’s name and location. \n​ \n​The process of publishing a content (making it available for streaming) goes as follows: first, a content specialist (from Netflix) will receive a list of potential contents and he will add them to the system, then the content provider will receive a notification asking for his approval, the content will become available for streaming after the approval of the provider. A content specialist can add many contents and a provider can approve many contents but a content can only be added by exactly one specialist and approved by at most one provider. \n​Call-center employees can record many customers’ complaints, he will be able to create a complaint case, update it, and close it. Also, Call-center employees can call customers to promote movie offers, they can promote to many customers but they should at least promote to 6 customers, and a customer could receive promotion from several call-center employees but he shouldn’t receive more than 4, and the system should keep track of the customers’ feedback from the promotion call. For a call-center to receive a bonus, he/she should record the feedback of at least 20 customers. \nPhase 2: \n3) Domain Modeling \nA. Use the “Noun Technique” to identify the Domain Classes in this narration. (create a list containing all the nouns and whether you should include those as classes or not). \nB. Draw a Domain Model Class Diagram showing classes with attributes and multiplicity as well as any type of relationship (association, whole-part, and generalization/specialization) as appropriate. \n4) Activity Diagrams, System Sequence Diagrams and State Diagrams \nA. Draw a detailed Activity diagram for any USE-case you choose from part 1 above. \nB. Draw a detailed Sequence Diagram for any USE-case you choose from part 1 above. \nC. Draw a State Diagram that shows the states a Skills Required",

      "text": "By Mary Grace Garis Nov 21 \nAs we turn a corner on true winter, there's a strong urge to curl up with Netflix and a few yuletide classics... or not. Maybe the Netflix part appeals, but you feel like keeping warm another way, and can't wait for the dirty movies coming to Netflix in December . Because what else makes the season bright than using your friend's dad's Netflix password to launch into somewhat explicit territory? It breaks up all the family-friendly fodder you're forced fed during the month. True to form, Netflix in bringing some new, slightly scandalous material in December... although there's no questioning that it's an eclectic mix. \nNow, this time around, there isn't anything known for its stylish sexuality, although rest assured you can still stream Blue is the Warmest Color or several cuts and volumes of Nymphomaniac if you're feeling bold. Instead, you have a few brand spanking new films anchored by beautiful and naive protagonists, and your classic frat house deviance, if you're into that. Whatever your fancy, I've collected them all for your viewing pleasure. \nSo, without further delay, these are the dirtiest films that are coming to Netflix in December, and how they should satiate your cravings this season. National Lampoon's Animal House [Embed] \nUnless you have the hots for John Belushi (R.I.P.), you probably won't be going to this one for sexual titillation. However, this is vintage raunch, and it should be experience at least once. Black Snake Moan [Embed] \nChristina Ricci's character Rae is trouble, trouble, trouble, and ends up in her underwear, literally chained in Samuel L. Jackson's house. It's definitely an acquired taste, and is really recommended if you have a stomach for Tarantino-y things. Dreamland [Embed] \nA struggling musicians ends up in an steamy affair with an older woman, one who's willing to help out financially during these trying times. This is more on the level of classy-dirty. Something about the Mrs. Robinson trope does that to a film. White Girl [Embed] \nIt's a film that follows a flaxen haired college student, who gets romantically tangled up with a small-time drug dealer, and spends a lot of the movie trying to get untangled from a mess that follows after his arrest. It got substantial comparisons to Harmony Korine's Kids when it comes out, which probably says a lot. House Of Wax (2005) [Embed] \nAre you looking for something void of taste or artistic merit? Cool, this is the mid-2000s horror movie remake (if you can call it that) where Paris Hilton dies. The Model [Embed] \nThink of it as a more stylish (literally stylish) alternative to White Girl , which has a burgeoning teen model falling into the glamorous world of exploitation and pool sex. \nSee? If you open your mind and expand your definition of the word dirty, you've got lots of options for what to watch this upcoming month. You're welcome, perverts. \nImages: Filmrise ",

      "text": "Ubisoft revealed that its virtual reality games - including the upcoming Star Trek: Bridge Crew and new title Eagle Flight - will support cross-platform play . \nBut our journey ends this week with exciting news for Nintendo fans, as Mario is coming to the real world thanks to a new partnership with Universal theme parks . Nintendo promises to bring its most popular characters to life \"in new and innovative ways that capture what makes them so special.\" \nLet's-a go! ;-) Global giveaway! \nThere’s still time for you to enter our latest giveaway… but you’ll have to be quick! \nIn the first of our festive giveaways, we're offering our readers around the world the chance to win a Microsoft Lumia 650 smartphone, Microsoft Universal Mobile Keyboard, and a whopping 200GB SanDisk Ultra Class 10 microSDXC card! \nThere are loads of ways for you to enter the contest, so head over to the giveaway page ... and good luck! :-) Bonus content \nBefore we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a few extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. \nRich Woods reviewed the Lenovo Yoga Book (Android edition). It's extraordinarily beautiful, thin and light, and features a touchscreen with pen support, along with a touch-sensitive keyboard which can be switched off and used as a canvas for drawing and writing. There's a great deal to like about it - but is it worth buying? \n(And by the way, stay tuned for our review of the Windows 10 edition of the Yoga Book - it's coming soon!) \nRich also shared his review of the Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 , the first Windows phone to launch with virtual reality support - it even comes with its own headset. It's a beautiful device with a stunning display and powerful hardware... but it's not quite perfect, and it's only available on one carrier in one country. \nAnd finally, it wasn't all that long ago that IDC predicted Windows phones would grab over 20% of the global smartphone market by 2015. That clearly didn't happen - and with Windows now expected to end this year on just 0.4% market share, IDC now forecasts that its share will drop further, to less than 0.1% by 2020. \nI took a closer look at the situation , to consider how realistic that latest prediction actually is. \nStay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. \nFor now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums .

      "text": "Spectral is a mysterious upcoming Netflix feature film made in 2014. Its description on IMDB says it's \"A sci-fi /thriller story centered on a special-ops team that is dispatched to fight supernatural beings.\"\nSet in an unnamed Eastern European city, the trailer portrays what appears to be a deadly plague of Poltergeist -like apparitions. Only these ghosts aren't misty, floating phantoms—they're deadly, like Slimer on steroids. \nWe kid but Spectral is clearly an original take on deadly phantoms and the military thriller, and the trailer, featuring stars James Badge Dale and Bruce Greenwood, has echoes of excellent films from the past, like Aliens . \nSpectral will be available to stream on Netflix beginning December 9, 2016.",

      "text": "Netflix Offline Viewing: Here's How To Download Netflix Movies And TV Shows To Watch Offline 3 December 2016, 6:30 pm EST By Chris Loterina Tech Times Computer Technology - How Laptops, Personal Computers And Tablets Are Changing The World Now Playing Netflix is finally allowing downloads of movies and shows for offline viewing. If you would like to try the new feature, the process is straightforward and simple and - with strong internet connection - you should be viewing your favorite title in no time. ( Netflix ) Advertisement \nNetflix has successfully resisted the clamor to provide offline content in the past. This has already changed as the company announced that its subscribers will now be able to view movies and media content offline. Netflix Requirements \nThe offline mode feature is not yet available for all Netflix contents. A select number of titles are currently identified as offline-mode-ready and that they are only currently available to iOS and Android platforms. \nIf you are eager to dive into the new feature, the process is straightforward and easy. \nFirst, make sure that you satisfy several requirements. If your device runs iOS, be sure that it is updated to iOS 8.1 or later. The same goes for Android users, who need to have their firmware updated to at least Android 4.4.2. \nThe Netflix mobile apps for these platforms also need to be their latest iterations. How To Download And View Files Offline \nTo download a file, you can simply search for a title and see if it supports offline viewing. This is indicated by a download icon located on the description page. Just tap it and the download should begin. Completed files can be accessed and viewed from inside the My Downloads section. \nIf you do not have a specific title in mind and wants to browse the library first, you can navigate to the Available for Download option found in the Netflix menu. It will enumerate all titles available that can be viewed offline. \nManaging downloaded movies and shows is also easy. Just head to Edit in the upper right corner of the screen. Then tap X to permanently delete the downloaded file. Bulk deletion is also possible by opening App Settings and tapping Clear All Downloads. Why No Offline Mode Till Now? \nThere is still no word about the sudden turnaround. However, there are previous Netflix pronouncements that shed light on why the company has not introduced an offline mode for a long time. The argument is that pure online viewing offline viewing is a marketing strategy that aims to differentiate the brand from the rest of competing media streaming services. \n\"It's the 'Paradox of Choice', the jam experiment — you put strawberry, apricot and blackberry jam in the supermarket aisle and you can persuade half the people coming down the aisle to taste the jam and maybe buy one,\" Neil Hunt, chief product officer at Netflix, said in an interview during the Berlin IFA show last year. \"But if you decide to add lemon, orange, blueberry and grapefruit, by adding the choices you don't increase the number of people choosing one, but in fact you go the other way.\" \nAdditionally, Hunt also pointed out that an offline download feature will bring in an additional complication to the media streaming process. Speaking to Gizmodo, the Netflix executive argued that users will have to wait for the download to finish, therefore, it is not an instant experience. He also pointed that users also have reserve storage space, including the additional effort to manage downloaded files. Competitive Pressure \nIt appears that market trends finally prompted Netflix to change its position. There is a huge demand for it and rivals such as Amazon Prime have been successful in converting the feature as a valuable selling point.  ",

What’s more, Season 2 will pick up with 10 new episodes on May 5. \nAs Netflix debuts are want to do, the shows will be available to stream (and now possibly download ) starting at 12:01 a.m. PT on the given release date. \nThe description provided for the Christmas Special leaves a lot to the imagination: “The journey continues as these eight singular hearts and minds weave in and out of each other’s lives finding deeper connections, learning darker, more desperate secrets about one another and struggling to identify with more than just oneself.” A similarly vague setup for Season 2 says that the whole cast will struggle to survive and understand one another “against all odds.” \nIn his review of the first season, Variety TV critic Brian Lowry wrote, “The main problem, simply, is that the show doesn’t make much sense.” Still, the streaming service in banking on the series to hold onto its devoted audience for the foreseeable future. \n“Sense8” stars Tuppence Middleton, Brian J. Smith, Doona Bae, Aml Ameen, Max Riemelt, Tina Desai, Miguel Ángel Silvestre and Jamie Clayton as eight strangers who become mentally and emotionally linked. \nLana Wachowski, Grant Hill and J. Michael Straczynski are the show’s executive producers. Filed Under: ",

      "text": "Carter Lee \nThe following article is entirely the opinion of Carter Lee and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr. \nSome of the best movies that are blockbuster hits can be found on Netflix and HBO GO. Many of the best movies on HBO GO and Netflix are obvious, like Deadpool , but some are blockbusters of yesteryear that are often overlooked. With an abundance of films it’s easy to miss some big hits when browsing through the titles. Netflix and HBO GO often feature big movies like Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice , but the majority of critics and viewers panned the film. All of the pictures on this list are favored highly by both critics and audiences alike. Some of the movies on this list are dramas, others are thrillers, and some are action based, but they are all smash-hits. \n300 \nConsidered one of the best action movies of 2007, HBO GO hosts this visually stunning film based on the graphic novel by Frank Miller. \nJaws \nIt’s nearly impossible to make a list of blockbuster films without including Steven Spielberg, and the film that started the summer of blockbusters. Jaws is often regarded as one of the best movies of all-time, and you can sink your teeth into this suspenseful masterpiece on Netflix. [Image by Universal Pictures] \nThe Green Mile \nTom Hanks’ name is synonymous with hit movies, and this Oscar nominated film is one of his best. You can watch all of the drama and mystery, based on Stephen King’s bestseller, on HBO GO. \nGladiator \nThis visually stunning epic-adventure is available on Netflix. \nO Brother, Where Art Thou? \nYou can catch this Coen brothers’ flick on Netflix, and it’s arguably one of their best movies alongside Fargo . \nBatman \nWith The Dark Knight trilogy being such an enormous success, it’s easy to forget the 1989 hit that took Batman into the modern era. Before Jack Nicholson and Michael Keaton brought the story to life on the big screen, the only way to watch the caped crusader was from re-runs of the ’60s TV show. Tune into HBO GO if you want to know the answer to the Joker’s question, “Where does he get those wonderful toys?” \nThe Usual Suspects \nThis is not only one of the best movies on Netflix, but it is one of the best films from the 1990s. This is one of those movies that need to be viewed a few times over to fully appreciate it. Newer audiences will enjoy learning why, “the greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world he didn’t exist.” \n28 Days Later \nWhat’s more terrifying than zombies? Zombies that run really—really—fast. 28 Days Later is one of the best modern zombie movies and you can watch all of the terrifying suspense on HBO GO. \nAlive \nBased on a true story about the survivors of a plane crash over the Andes Mountains, a rugby team will stop at no lengths to survive. You can checkout all of the drama and suspense on Netflix. \nCarlito’s Way \nSean Penn and Al Pacino have never looked better than in this Brian De Palma masterpiece. The New Yorker describes why this is one of the best movies on HBO GO . \n“What makes the material feel new is Carlito’s unpredictable chemistry with his lawyer, Davey Kleinfeld (Sean Penn). Carlito doesn’t realize that the coke-addled Kleinfeld is as ruthless as any gangland enemy… Few films actually made in the disco era can match the kinetic allure of this 1993 production, which has a bluesy undertow all its own. De Palma’s nerve-wracking and elegant set pieces include a climax that suggests what Orson Welles could have done with a Steadicam. David Koepp wrote the beautifully structured script, from two novels by Edwin Torres.” \nGalaxy Quest \nPerfect for fans of sci-fi or satire, Galaxy Quest is available on Netflix. [Image by DreamWorks Pictures] \nMinority Report \nTom Cruise stars in this Steven Spielberg hit that is one of the best sci-fi movies on HBO GO. \nRomancing the Stone \nIf you like your action with some comedy, then look no further. Michael Douglas, Kathleen Turner, and Danny DeVito star in this ’80s classic available on HBO GO. \nHoney, I Shrunk the Kids \nFamily movies aren’t always enjoyable for the whole family, often the adults are left bored, but this is one film that everyone will enjoy. You can checkout this fun-filled adventure on Netflix. \nI Am Legend \nThis film has as much horror as it does heart. You can watch Will Smith as the last man on earth, surrounded by vampires, via HBO GO. \nCharlie Wilson’s War \nTom Hanks co-stars alongside the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in this film on HBO GO, and it features some of the wittiest dialogue ever performed. \nMission: Impossible 3 \nAnother smash-success starring Tom Cruise and Philip Seymour Hoffman, and you have never seen Hoffman this evil. Your mission, if you choose to accept, is to watch this non-stop, action-adventure on Netflix. \nThe Neverending Story \nBlockbusters formed in the ’70s, and they erupted in the ’80s. This film was one of the biggest hits in 1984, and now thanks to HBO GO a new generation can see what’s so special about a story that never ends. \nThe Rock \nIf you need a reminder that Nicolas Cage used to be in really good movies, then The Rock is a great place to start. Sean Connery and Ed Harris co-star in this action-thriller available on Netflix. \nBeverly Hills Cop \nEddie Murphy was unstoppable in the ’80s, just like the laughs and thrills garnere d from this hit featured on Netflix.

Smith) and Wolfgang (Max Riemelt) come together both physically and mentally, plunged into the middle of each other’s tragedies and triumphs. On the run from Whispers (Terrence Mann), and forced to question their very identity, it’s a matter of survival as the Sensates must find a way to live with, understand and protect one another against all odds.”",

      "text": "Both Netflix and Amazon have been offering select content in 4K Ultra HD for quite some time now and comparatively, Hulu has been slow to follow. Now the streaming service has finally jumped on the 4K bandwagon , as The Verge reports, but there isn’t a wealth of content at launch, and ways to watch are limited.\nAs usual, you’ll need to make sure that you have a 4K-ready TV and fast enough internet to support a 4K stream — Hulu says it requires a minimum of 13 megabits per second for 4K streaming — but you’ll also need supported hardware. Right now, only two devices are capable of streaming 4K from Hulu: the PlayStation 4 Pro and Xbox One S game consoles.\nMore : Hulu’s two new deals bring its internet TV service close than ever\nIf you’re fortunate enough to have the right hardware to watch Hulu’s new 4K streams, you’ll also find content is limited. The bulk of available content right now consists of Hulu original series like 11.22.63 , The Path, Chance, and Shut Eye. If you’re a fan of Hulu’s original programming, this is great, but otherwise the offerings seem somewhat lackluster. Unless, that is, you’re a James Bond fan.\nIn addition to Hulu originals, a total of 20 Bond films from the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer catalog are available in 4K. This includes the recent Spectre, and classics like Goldfinger, From Russia With Love, and Dr. No , among others.\nThough there isn’t much here at the start, it’s telling that Hulu has finally entered the 4K game at all. It’s a fairly safe bet that more content will be available sooner rather than later, and it shouldn’t be too long before the service offers 4K content on other devices as well. Whether HDR (high dynamic range) content is on the way as well is currently unknown, but with both Netflix and Amazon supporting it, it seems likely that Hulu would like to offer it eventually.\nGot a new 4K UHD TV? Here’s where to go to start watching the best 4K content right now What sort of hardware does your PC need to play games at 4K resolution?",

The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday. AP Binge watching on Netflix no longer requires internet access MICHAEL LIEDTKE Associated Press ( … ) Elise Amendola, AP file \nNetflix subscribers can now download shows and movies to watch later when they’re not online, like during a flight or car. The download option was added to phone and tablet apps Wednesday. \nSAN FRANCISCO — Netflix subscribers can now binge on many of their favorite shows and movies even when they don't have an internet connection. \nThe long-awaited offline option gives Netflix's 87 million subscribers offline access to videos for the first time in the streaming service's decade-long history. \nNetflix is matching a downloading feature that one of its biggest rivals, Amazon.com , has been offering to its video subscribers for the past year. It's something that also has been available on YouTube's popular video site, though a subscription is required in the U.S. and other countries where the site sells its \"Red\" premium service. \nThe new feature puts Netflix a step ahead of two other major rivals. Offline options aren't available on HBO's internet-only package, HBO Now, or Hulu, although that service has publicly said it hopes to introduce a downloading feature. \nNetflix subscribers wishing to download a video on their smartphone or tablet need to update the app on their Apple or Android device. \nNot all of the selections in Netflix's video library can be downloaded, although several of the service's most popular shows, including \"Orange Is The New Black,\" ''House of Cards,\" and \"Stranger Things,\" are now available to watch offline. \nDownloadable movies include \"Spotlight,\" this year's Oscar winner for best film. Notably missing from the downloadable menu are movies and TV shows made by Walt Disney Co. Those still require an internet connection to watch on Netflix. \nThe Los Gatos, California, company is promising to continue to adding more titles to its offline roster. \nNetflix CEO Reed Hastings had long resisted calls for an offline-viewing option, much to the frustration of customers who wanted flexibility to use their subscriptions to watch a show or movie when traveling on a train, plane or car where internet connections are spotty or completely unavailable. \nEarlier this year, Hastings finally indicated he might relent and introduce downloading.   \nThe change of heart coincided with Netflix's expansion into more than 130 countries, including many areas with shoddy or expensive internet connections that make the ability to watch video offline even more appealing. \nNetflix ended September with 39 million subscribers outside of the U.S. \nThe offline option may accelerate the decline of Netflix's steadily shrinking DVD-by-mail service, which offers the ability to watch video without an internet connection. Netflix's DVD side still has one distinct advantage — access to recent theatrical releases before they are available for streaming. \nNetflix's DVD service ended September with 4.3 million subscribers, a decrease of nearly 10 million customers during the past five years.

      "text": "\nVideo: On December 9, Netflix is dropping a movie that was supposed to be in theatres over the winter. It's called Spectral , and while all the signs point to it being really bad, the first trailer is really good. \nHere it is. \nSpectral stars James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood in what looks like Black Hawk Down meets Ghostbusters . If you watched the trailer, you get what we mean — it's modern soldiers fighting some kind of supernatural beings. This comparison especially works toward the end of the trailer, when the soldiers modify their weapons to fight the ghosts, which is just incredibly badarse. \nNow, as we covered last month , there's a caveat here. Spectral was supposed to be a wide winter theatrical release, only to be dropped by its distributor and subsequently picked up but Netflix. Which could very well mean it's bad — but you'd have to tie me down to not give it a shot. That trailer rules. \nSpectral hits Netflix December 9. ",

This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. × Netflix now lets you watch your favorite shows offline Netflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nNEW YORK — It just got even easier to binge on Netflix. \nNetflix announced on Wednesday members now have the option to download movies and shows to watch offline later. This means you can finally watch the new season of Stranger Things and Bloodline while on a flight or stuck in the subway. \nThe feature comes free of cost with all Netflix memberships. Members will want to make sure they have the most recent Netflix app on their Android or iOS devices to access the new “download” button. \nUp until now, you needed a place with a reliable internet connection to access the streaming service. But Netflix wants to make its product more nimble to suit the lives of those on the go. \nYou’ll find Orange Is the New Black, Narcos and The Crown available — but you can’t download everything. Shows like the new season of Gilmore Girls, Friends and New Girl are restricted for now. \nThe company previously argued the feature was unnecessary, calling it a “short term fix for a bigger problem.” That problem, of course, being wireless internet availability. \nBut its competitor Amazon Prime embraced offline downloads for iOS and Android users more than a year ago. \nAccording to Netflix’s Help Center page, “you’ll want to delete”downloaded titles before attempting to download new content. \nThat’s because some licensing agreements have limits on the number of titles people can download at the same time. The length of time Netflix users will have to watch a show or movie will vary by title. The “My Downloads” page will show members how long, such as 48 hours, they have with each title. \nThe company said in an email to CNNMoney it is working with “lots” of partners globally on securing downloading rights “for the bulk of the content on our service.” ",
