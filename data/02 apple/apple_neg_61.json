The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance.

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Related content",

      "text": "FCC Public File Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.

      "text": "December 6, 2016 6:57 PM High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

      "text": "Latest News And Scoops On Smartphone Now Playing Samsung scored a major win against Apple on Tuesday, in a long-standing patent dispute. The Supreme Court overturned a previous federal court ruling awarding Apple nearly $400 million in damages for Samsung products that infringed on its design patents. ( Alex Wong | Getty Images ) Advertisement \nSamsung just scored a major win in its patent dispute with Apple, as the Supreme Court just overturned a previous ruling that awarded Apple nearly $400 million in damages. \nApple and Samsung have been dragging each other through courts for many years now and their patent dispute is unlikely to end anytime soon, but the numbers keep changing the equation. \nIn this case, the numbers refer to the damages Samsung has to pay for infringing on Apple's patents. Apple's Win In Federal Court \nBack in 2012, a federal court sided with Apple and ruled that a number of Samsung devices had infringed upon design patents owned by Apple. One of the design patents in question was for a rectangular device with bezels and rounded corners. Another patent referred to a black home screen consisting of a colorful app grid. The case involved a number of Samsung smartphones found to infringe on Apple patents, including the old Galaxy S II . \nApple actually won a nearly $1 billion verdict at the time, which was later reduced to $548 million . Of that sum, design patents accounted for roughly $400 million. Samsung's Win In Supreme Court \nThe new ruling [PDF] from the Supreme Court doesn't reverse Apple's previous victory, but it does warrant a damages reassessment, for which the case will return to the Federal Circuit. \nThat nearly $400 million in damages Apple won covered the total profits Samsung generated from its infringing devices. However, Samsung argued that the infringing aspects were just parts of the phone, therefore the damages should not equal the entire profit. Since just part of the devices' design was infringing upon Apple's patents, it should pay only part of the profit, Samsung reasoned. \n\"A smartphone is smart because it contains hundreds of thousands of the technologies that make it work,\" Samsung argued at one point, as cited by Apple Insider. \nA federal court had previously rejected this argument, but the Supreme Court has now sided with Samsung and decided that it should indeed pay only part of the profit it made off the infringing devices, not the entire profit. Reassessing Damages In Federal Circuit \nThe Supreme Court did not dictate how to reassess the damages. According to Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor, damages could be calculated either based on the entire profit from an infringing product, or based only on part of the product's profit. As neither Apple nor Samsung briefed the court on how they want to calculate the damages in this case, the Supreme Court is tossing the ball back in the federal circuit court to rule on the proper interpretation.

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations Posted: Updated: \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.  ",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 7:57 PM High court sides with Samsung in patent dispute with Apple FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. Ahn Young-joon, File AP Photo i Order Reprint of this Story WASHINGTON \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone. \nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs. \n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\" Related content",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations Posted: Updated: \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.  ",

      "text": "Apple’s iPhones Account For 8 Out Of 10 Of Flickr’s Top Devices By Tyler Lee on 12/06/2016 17:19 PST \nWith our smartphones sporting more-than-capable cameras, taking a photo on the go has become extremely easy. Just whip out your phone, fire up the camera app, and you’re good to go. This is compared to before where users had to bring around cameras which weren’t exactly convenient unless you had a reason for doing so. \nThis explains why according to Flickr’s annual data , smartphones continue to dominate its photo-sharing platform and account for 48% of devices used to capture and share videos. “Smartphones accounted for 48% of the photos uploaded to Flickr, up from 39% last year. DSLR was 25%, down from 31% in 2015, and point and shoot was 21%, down from 25% in 2015. Mirrorless remained flat at 3% of photos uploaded in 2016.” \nIn fact Flickr claims that smartphones are so dominant that out of its top 10 devices, 8 of them belong to Apple’s iPhone lineup. The top 3 positions also belong to Apple with the iPhone 6, iPhone 5s , and the iPhone 6s. Following Apple’s iPhones, Flickr says that Canon is the second largest brand and accounted for 24%, with the Canon 5D Mark III and 5D Mark II being the remaining two cameras in the top 10 list that aren’t made by Apple. \nOf course this list and stats by no means disparages the capabilities of other smartphone cameras. In fact blind tests have found that there are phones out there that can take better photos than the iPhone, but we guess as far as Flickr’s platform is concerned, the iPhone continues to reign supreme. \nFiled in Apple > Cellphones > Photo-Video .

      "text": "  @08:25PM from the making-your-life-easier dept. Apple has launched Single Sign-on, a service designed to make logging into TV apps much less annoying . It \"allows cable subscribers to sign in once with their cable credentials to gain access to all cable-restricted content in iOS and tvOS apps,\" writes Juli Clover via MacRumors: Single Sign-on is limited to the United States, and according to a support document , is available for the following providers: CenturyLink Prism, DirecTV, Dish, GVTC, GTA, Hawaiian Telecom, Hotwire, MetroCast, and Sling. While Single Sign-on was introduced and tested in the tvOS 10.1 and iOS 10.2 betas, the feature was remotely released today to all iOS 10 and tvOS 10 devices. Using Single Sign-on does not require one of the betas, and is instead immediately available to all iPhone and Apple TV users running iOS 10 or tvOS 10. With Single Sign-on, customers with a supported provider will use the Settings options in iOS or tvOS to sign in with their cable credentials. From then on, when accessing a supported app that requires a cable subscription, the app will ask to use the saved sign-on credentials. Most cable channels and content providers offer individual apps on the Apple TV and iOS devices, but still require cable authentication before users can access content. Prior to Single Sign-on, customers were required to enter their credentials in each individual app, a frustrating and time-consuming process.",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations   \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.  ",

      "text": "12/06/16 AT 8:00 PM Close \nJust last month, Apple launched a battery replacement program for some Chinese iPhone 6s users who experienced unexpected shutdowns. This Tuesday, the tech giant published a press release explaining what caused the battery issue by citing a manufacturing problem. \n“We found that a small number of iPhone 6S devices made in September and October 2015 contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been before being assembled into battery packs,” Apple stated in its press release. “As a result, these batteries degrade faster than a normal battery and cause unexpected shutdowns to occur. It's important to note, this is not a safety issue.” \nIn simpler terms, the batteries for some iPhone 6s models were overexposed to air, possibly being left out in the open in a manufacturing warehouse for a long period of time, as explained by ArsTechnica . It remains unclear how many iPhone 6s models are affected by this battery problem. As of writing, it appears that iPhone 6s Plus models are not affected by this issue. Related Stories Chinese Users Complain Of Exploding Apple iPhones \nUnfortunately, Apple also said on its press release that some owners of the iPhone 6s that were manufactured later than October 2015 have also been experiencing the same battery issue. The tech giant isn’t issuing another battery replacement program for those specific models yet as the company will still be assessing if this is in fact the same type of manufacturing problem. \nApple said that it will be rolling out an iOS update next week that includes “additional diagnostic capability,” which will allow the company to sufficiently diagnose what’s causing any battery issues. The company says that the update will allow them to collect data in the coming weeks which could possibly improve their algorithms in managing battery performance on iPhones. \nIf Apple does indeed see improvements, the company plans to simply continue rolling out software updates to curb any more battery problems. This version of the software is believed to be iOS 10.2, which is currently in beta for developers.

REUTERS/Lucy Nicholson/File Photo A \nSAN FRANCISCO: Apple Watch sales appear to have rebounded for the holidays from mid-year doldrums on a redesign, price cuts and strong promotions, but analysts say long-term demand has yet to be proven. \nThe Watch is Apple Inc's first new product under Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook and is seen as a barometer of whether the company can find new sources of revenue to boost sales which now largely depend on the iPhone. \nCook told Reuters on Monday that Watch sell-through - a measure of how many units are sold to consumers, rather than simply stocked on retailers' shelves - reached a new high during the first week of holiday shopping. Cook's comments followed a report on Monday from technology research firm IDC that painted a more alarming picture, estimating Watch sales fell 71 percent in the third quarter of 2016. \nThe sharp change in seasonal demand, also revealed in separate data from market research firm Slice Intelligence, amplifies some analysts' concerns that the Apple Watch may not be a formidable hit on the order of the iPhone or iPad. \n\"Let’s see if the demand carries through to the next quarter,\" said analyst Colin Gillis of BGC Partners. \nData from Slice Intelligence shows sales were tepid in July and August and then jumped in September, when the watch was updated. \nSlice reported that sales faded somewhat in October and strengthened again in November. Average selling prices of the watch fell to US$353.19 in November from US$393.39 in October, according to Slice. \nApple Watch prices experienced a similar dip last year, hitting US$321.63 in December 2015, although the drop this year is notable because it comes in the wake of a product update. \nApple, which declined to comment on the Slice data, has cut the retail price of the entry level watch over the last year. The original Apple Watch debuted in 2015 with a starting price of US$349, but Apple trimmed the price to US$299 in March 2016. It dropped it again to US$269 in September, when a new generation of watches was released. \nApple also raised the profile of the Watch this holiday season. That effort included a promotional deal with Nike and aggressive advertising. Researcher Market Track said that promotions of Apple watches in retailer circulars have risen to 14 percent of the wearables market this year from 6 percent last year. \nApple may also be getting a boost from sales of the original Watch. It no longer sells solely in its own stores, but some third-party retailers, such as Target and Best Buy offer it, often with deep discounts for older models. Some of those same retailers, and Apple itself, offered gift-card based discounts on the newer watches as well on Black Friday. \n\"Whether Apple can sustain this strength will be the key question and at what impact to margins,\" Wells Fargo analyst Maynard Um wrote in a note to investors. \nWhile Apple has cut retail prices, it has cut costs as well. This year's entry-level 38-millimeter watch cost about US$92.78 to make, compared with US$98.79 for last year's model, according to an analysis by IHS, a technology research firm. Analyst Kevin Keller said that the difference between retail price and production price still left Apple with a \"substantial amount of money.\" \n(Reporting by Julia Love and Stephen Nellis; additional reporting by Deborah Todd and Nandita Bose.

      "text": "Deals Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "WASHINGTON The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.\nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.\nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.\nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.\nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.\nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.\nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\"\nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.\nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.\n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 4:42 PM Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations The Associated Press Order Reprint of this Story SAN FRANCISCO \nApple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Related content",

      "text": "Eight iPhones allegedly caught fire in China, Apple cites external damage Eight iPhones allegedly caught fire in China, Apple cites external damage Posted: Tags : Apple - Apple + Apple is dealing with a bit of an exploding battery crisis in China as a Shanghai consumer group handed in eight reports of users claiming their iPhone 6 handsets spontaneously combusted. This is the third battery complaint issued by Chinese consumer groups over the past few weeks. Following analysis, Apple claimed the fires were caused by external physical damage and weren't down to a manufacturing fault. It also encouraged customers to seek resolution to their problems inside Apple stores and via the company's support.Chinese users started complaining of iPhones (6 and 6s) suddenly shutting down despite having half their battery charge remaining. Apple investigated and found out that a limited batch of iPhone 6s units assembled in September and October suffered from a manufacturing fault. It began replacing units with faulty batteries worldwide. Apple also said it will update iOS with a diagnostic tool that gathers information about battery issues, which will be used to improve battery management algorithms. ALSO READ",

      "text": "WASHINGTON - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.\nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.\nFILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File)\nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.\nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.\nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.\nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favourable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.\nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\"\nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.\nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.\n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"\n ",

      "text": "December 6, 2016 at 1:10 pm | UPDATED: December 6, 2016 at 3:00 pm var _ndnq = _ndnq || []; _ndnq.push([’embed’]); \nCUPERTINO — Apple has agreed to pay $450,000 as part of a settlement with the California Department of Toxic Substances Control, which alleged it found hazardous waste violations at two electronic waste shredding facilities that the tech firm operated without initially informing the state. \nApple suggested Tuesday that the violations were due to an oversight in filing the proper paperwork and that its safety standards at both plants had never put the public at risk. But the department claimed the tech firm had violated the state’s health and safety codes. \n“Compliance with the hazardous waste law is fundamental in protecting the health of workers and communities as well as the environment,” said Keith Kihara, chief of DTSC’s enforcement division, in a statement. “We are encouraged by the settlement and that Apple is working with us to take the necessary steps to comply with California’s hazardous waste law.” \nFrom 2011 to 2012, Apple processed 1.1 million pounds of electronic waste at a Cupertino facility on Tantau Avenue without DTSC’s knowledge. The company closed the facility in January 2013 and moved its operations to a facility in Sunnyvale, where workers processed 803,518 pounds of electronic waste before Apple informed the state of the plant’s existence, according to a complaint filed on behalf of the agency. \nAfter the DTSC inspected the Sunnyvale facility in June 2013, it discovered that Apple produced a fine dust that also was vacuumed from the floors and then shipped to a recycling facility in Roseville. The department tested the dust and waste collected from the floors and found it contained hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles. \nThe recycling plant in Roseville isn’t authorized to handle hazardous waste, but the plant didn’t know the waste was hazardous because Apple didn’t properly label the shipments. \nDTSC also found out, after reviewing Apple’s record, that the tech firm had opened and closed an electronic waste plant in Cupertino without letting the state know, and had processed similar electronic waste there. \nThe agency claimed that Apple not only failed to submit the proper paperwork for both facilities, but that it was disposing and transporting hazardous waste in a way that ran afoul of the state’s health and safety codes. Apple also didn’t label or mark used oil containers as hazardous waste. \nOn Tuesday, an Apple spokeswoman said in a statement that the whole issue arose over an “oversight in filing paperwork” when it closed its recycling facility in Cupertino to expand to a larger site. \n“We’ve worked closely with DTSC to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site,” she said. “As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.” \nThe California Attorney’s General’s Office, which represented the DTSC, filed the settlement in Santa Clara County Superior Court. \nAs part of the settlement, Apple will ensure it does comply with all laws and regulations that the agency brought up and conduct weekly inspections in its facilities where hazardous waste is produced.

A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) By SAM HANANEL The Associated Press WASHINGTON — \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own.

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Copyright The Associated Press \n ",

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) A A WASHINGTON (AP) — \nThe Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices. \nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look. \nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market. \nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\" \n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\" \nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\" \nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants.

      "text": "Subscribe to this topic \nT im Cook began Apple’s latest product unveiling with a video narrated by a disabled woman using a Mac with the help of an assistive device — a switch that she could bump with the side of her head. Her name is Sady Paulson , and the message couldn’t have been clearer: With the right technology, even people with almost no control over their bodies can interact with the world and harness their own creativity in ways that were previously impossible. Wireless freedom for disabled people \nThe video was upbeat and inspirational, meant to affirm Apple’s commitment to accessibility. But what it didn’t show was the struggle those like Paulson have when it comes to controlling a multitude of devices. That head-triggered switch might be her only means of controlling her wheelchair, computer, or phone or tablet. If it’s hardwired into one of these devices, how can it control the others? Simon Cohen/Digital Trends Simon Cohen/Digital Trends Simon Cohen/Digital Trends \nThis is the problem that Mauricio Meza, co-founder of Toronto’s Komodo OpenLab, is tackling with the $350 Tecla Shield , a Bluetooth gateway that conveys switch commands to any compatible computer, phone, or tablet. With the help of a caregiver, the user simply plugs the assistive device into the Tecla Shield — it has two ports for switch devices and one for wheelchair control — and then pairs the Tecla Shield with the target computer or tablet. Depending on a user’s disability, they might want to use a single-click button with their hand, a head-triggered button as in the Apple video, a joystick, or any number of other devices purpose-built for these interactions. \nMore: Glassouse lets users control a cursor with their eyes — and mouth \n“Driving a wheelchair [using these inputs] is like second-nature,” Meza told Digital Trends, “so there’s almost no learning curve.” The Tecla Shield supports up to six switches at once, and each can trigger two types of actions: short and long presses. If a joystick is used, each of the four directions represents a switch, leaving room for two additional actions. For some, this is a good option, and navigating iOS is straightforward if not quite as convenient as using finger taps and gestures. But many do not possess this freedom of movement, or prefer to use a simpler input. Wheelchair integration \nThe Tecla Shield isn’t the first device that connects assistive switches to computers via Bluetooth; the $185 Blue2 Bluetooth Switch combines a physical switch with inputs for two more switches and Bluetooth, for example. But so far it’s the only one that gives wheelchair users the option of using their existing wheelchair control device, whether it’s a joystick, sip-and-puff controller, or any other kind of control. \nNeil Mercer, for example, is a disabled wheelchair user with very limited movement in his hands. Mercer has a joystick for wheelchair control but opts to control his Tecla Shield-enabled iPhone using a small, button-style switch. Apple has designed iOS with an ingenious system for switch-based navigation that involves targeting desired icons with a set of horizontally and vertically sliding bars: You click the button once each time a bar lines up with the row and column of the icon you want. It works, but the process is tedious and at times inefficient due to missed clicks. Mercer told us he is willing to put up with the process because clicking a button with his left hand is much less taxing physically than navigating with his wheelchair’s joystick. Unequal accessibility \nWith iOS (and all Apple products in fact), accessibility functions are built-in and highly consistent from one device to another, Meza points out. “Apple users now can transfer [their Tecla Shield-connected switches] independently from their phone to their iPad, computer, or AppleTV,” he said, “as long as all devices are under the same iCloud account and Wi-Fi network.” \n“I like the idea of control — that you plug in the switches once and you’re good to go” \nThe same cannot be said of the Android ecosystem, thanks to fragmentation and the tendency of some manufacturers to put customized layers on top of stock Android — Meza calls out LG as an example. “It’s the launcher,” he said, referring to the top-most layer of the operating system. “Most manufacturers don’t care to make them accessible.” \nSharon Rosenblatt is director of communications at Silver Spring, MD-based Accessibility Partners , a consultancy that helps its clients meet federal accessibility standards in their products and services. She agreed with Meza that Android lags behind iOS when it comes to accessibility. \n“The industry has been dominated by iOS,” she told us. “Apple has really made a commitment to accessibility.” Though Rosenblatt had not previously heard of the Tecla Shield, she’s bullish on its capabilities. “I like the idea of control — that you plug in the switches once and you’re good to go,” she told Digital Trends. \nShe also points out that people who need accessibility products often end up playing a waiting game in terms of compatibility: When new products enter the market, such as tablets or smartwatches, they don’t immediately possess the ability to connect to switch controls. “We have to wait until the next big product comes out and then figure out how to accommodate it,” Rosenblatt noted, “but [the Tecla Shield] seems very forward-thinking. I know of a number of disabled people who could definitely take advantage of it.” Simon Cohen/Digital Trends \nIf there’s a drawback to the Tecla Shield, it’s the need to switch modes when moving between non-Apple devices or from a non-Apple device to an Apple device. This is done through the use of a recessed button on the side of the Tecla, and would require the help of a caregiver for someone with severe mobility problems. It’s mostly a problem for people with PCs and Android devices, whereas users who stay within the Apple ecosystem will have an easier time. Financial help \nThe Tecla Shield has been under development since 2010, and Meza says about 3,000 people are using it around the world. In Canada, mobile carrier Bell Canada will subsidize a portion of the Tecla’s price, bringing the cost down to $200 CDN for customers on an existing mobile plan. In the U.S., Meza tells us that the sum might be covered in whole or in part by medical insurance under the mobility device category. \nIt can be easy to forget that the advances in technology we find so convenient and magical don’t improve all lives equally. High prices remain a barrier for many, and thankfully these are coming down all the time. Devices like the Tecla Shield ensure that physical barriers come down too.",

      "text": "View Comments Print By - Associated Press - Tuesday, December 6, 2016 \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia’s Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators’ knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as “an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn’t include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the “baghouse” dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn’t authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. \nCopyright © 2016 The Washington Times, LLC.",

      "text": "* Court says patent violator need not fork over all profits\n* Lower court will determine how much Samsung owes Apple\n* Samsung welcomes patent \"victory\"\n(Updates with comments from Samsung Electronics)\nDec 6 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with Samsung in its big-money smartphone patent fight with Apple, throwing out an appeals court ruling that the South Korean company had to pay a $399 million penalty to its American rival for copying key iPhone designs.\nThe 8-0 ruling, written by Justice Sonia Sotomayor, held that a patent violator does not always have to fork over its entire profits from the sales of products using stolen designs, if the designs covered only certain components and not the whole thing.\nThe justices sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to determine how much Samsung must pay. But they did not provide a road map to juries and lower courts on how to navigate similar disputes in the future.\nApple spokesman Josh Rosenstock said in a statement that the U.S. company remained \"optimistic that the lower courts will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\nSamsung told Reuters in a statement the ruling was a \"victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nFollowing a 2012 jury verdict favoring Apple, Samsung initially was hit with nearly $930 million in penalties, later cut by $382 million, for infringing Apple's iPhone patents and mimicking its distinctive appearance in making the Galaxy and other competing devices.\nSamsung in December 2015 paid its Cupertino, California-based rival $548 million. But Samsung took the matter to the Supreme Court, saying it should not have had to make $399 million of that payout for copying the patented designs of the iPhone's rounded-corner front face, bezel and colorful grid of icons that represent programs and applications.\nWith the products that used iPhone designs, Samsung went on to become the world's top smartphone maker.\nTuesday's ruling followed a ferocious legal battle between the world's top two smartphone manufacturers that began in 2011 when Apple sued Samsung for patent and trademark infringement. It was one of the most closely watched patent cases to come before the top U.S. court in recent years.\nThe legal dispute centered on whether the term \"article of manufacture,\" on which design patent damages are calculated in U.S. patent law, should be interpreted as a finished product in its entirety, or merely a component in a complex product.\nIn court papers, Samsung, Apple and the U.S. government all agreed that the term could mean a component.\nBut Apple urged the Supreme Court to affirm the appeals court's ruling because Samsung presented no evidence that the article of manufacture in this case was anything less than its entire smartphone as sold. Samsung, meanwhile, said that it did not have to present such evidence.\nSotomayor, writing for the unanimous court, said that the law is clear. The term \"article of manufacture is broad enough to encompass both a product sold to a consumer as well as a component of that product,\" she wrote.\nPERIOD OF UNCERTAINTY\nThe justices nevertheless refused to devise a test for juries and lower courts to use to discern what a relevant article of manufacture is in a particular case, a task that could be fraught with difficulty when considering high-tech products.\n\"No doubt whether with Apple-Samsung, or some other design patent case, we are going to have a period of uncertainty where courts will be trying to formulate a test and what the boundaries are,\" Richard McKenna, an expert in design rights at the law firm Foley & Lardner in Milwaukee, said in an interview.\nIn court papers, Apple said its iPhone's success was tied to innovative designs, which other manufacturers quickly adopted in their own products. Samsung, in particular, made a deliberate decision to copy the iPhone's look and many user interface features, Apple said.\nSamsung argued that it should not have had to turn over all its profits, saying that design elements contributed only marginally to a complex product with thousands of patented features.\nDesign patent fights very rarely reach the Supreme Court. It had not heard such a case in more than 120 years.\nThe case is Samsung Electronics Co, Ltd v. Apple Inc, in the Supreme Court of the United States, No. 15-777.\n(Reporting by Andrew Chung in New York; additional reporting by Lawrence Hurley in Washington and Se Young Lee in Seoul; Editing by Will Dunham and Stephen Coates)",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations Posted: Updated: \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Copyright 2016 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations 2 hrs ago ( … ) \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards.

      "title": "Supreme Court Complicates Design Patent Damage Calculation – Apple v. Samsung",
      "text": "Supreme Court Complicates Design Patent Damage Calculation – Apple v. Samsung   On December 6, 2016, the Supreme Court issued a rare unanimous decision on the issue of damages for design patent infringement that continues the Apple v. Samsung smartphone legal odyssey. It also marks only the second time in over 100 years that the court has issued a substantive decision in a design patent case. But the result could mean significant challenges in the calculation of damages for design patents and the need for additional factual and expert input, similar to the damage calculation for a utility patent. In a decision written by Justice Sotomayor, the court reversed the Federal Circuit holding that in the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant “article of manufacture” for arriving at a § 289 damages award need not be the end product sold to the consumer, but may be only a component of that product. The court also remanded the case back to the Federal Circuit for additional briefing on what constitutes an “article of manufacture” in the context of the relevant Apple design patents at issue. Apple had secured design patents directed to components of a smartphone, such as portions of the external housing and the arrangement of icons appearing on the phone’s screen. The Federal Circuit had identified the relevant “article of manufacture” as the entire smartphone because, in part, this is what the consumers could actually purchase in the marketplace. However, the Supreme Court rejected the Federal Circuit’s interpretation of § 289 that the permissible “article of manufacture” for the purpose of calculating damages must be the entire smartphone, and instead held that it could be a smartphone component. In the district court case below, Apple was awarded $399 million in damages —Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones. The Federal Circuit affirmed the damages award, rejecting Samsung’s argument that damages should be limited because the relevant articles of manufacture were the front face or screen rather than the entire smartphone. The Federal Circuit’s reasoning was that such a limit was not required because the components of Samsung’s smartphones were not sold separately to ordinary consumers, and thus were not distinct articles of manufacture. This is important because this “article of manufacture” then becomes the basis for the calculation of damages for infringement of design patents which cover the “article.” The Supreme Court held unanimously that the Federal Circuit incorrectly interpreted § 289 in holding that the permissible “article of manufacture” for the purpose of calculating damages must be the entire smartphone. Instead, the court found that an article of manufacture under § 289 is broad enough to include the entire end product or a component. This reading of § 289 was also consistent with other patent statutes, e.g., §§ 101 and 171(a) of the Patent Act. As the court noted: “A component of a product, no less than the product itself, is a thing made by hand or machine. That a component may be integrated into a larger product, in other words, does not put it outside the category of articles of manufacture.” The court further noted that: “While the design must be embodied in some articles, the statute is not limited to designs for complete articles, or ‘discrete’ articles, and certainly not to articles separately sold.” Justice Sotomayer was, however, quite careful in drafting the court’s opinion to state that the “only question we resolve today is whether in the case of a multicomponent product, the relevant ‘article of manufacture’ must always be the end product sold to the consumer or whether it can also be an component of that product.” The court expressly ruled that the relevant article of manufacture may, in some instances, be the end product sold to the consumers, and in other instances may be only a component of the resulting product. The court observed that in the case of a multicomponent product (like a kitchen oven), determining what the “article of manufacture” to which the design is applied is “a more difficult task.” In light of this decision, the lower courts must now determine the relevant “article of manufacture” for each of the infringed design patents, and then potentially recalculate damages, if the relevant article is something other than the entire smartphone. During the oral arguments and in several of the amicus curiae briefs, the court was presented with various proposed tests for determining the relevant “article of manufacture,” but the court observed that there was inadequate briefing or argument on this issue by Apple or Samsung. So, the court exercised restraint and sent the case back down to the lower courts to formulate such a test for how to best determine the relevant “article of manufacture” for the calculation of damages. The Supreme Court provided no guidance or hints to the lower courts on how to devise such a test. However, such a future test may examine the relationship among the design, any relevant components, and the product as a whole. In its amicus curiae brief, the United States offered a potential test that looked at several factors: Scope of the patented design (focusing on drawings and written description) and how the design relates to the product as a whole The relative prominence of the design within the product as a whole Whether the design is conceptually distinct from the product as a whole The physical relationship between the patented design and the rest of the product This decision is likely to be viewed as a partial victory for Samsung because it delays any final decision on the damage award and provides a path for arguing that any damages award should be limited to specific smartphone components. This decision may also be significant in future design patent cases on the issue of damages, particularly when the design patent protection is directed solely to a component or element of a product as compared to the entirety of the product. The net result of this decision is more factual and legal disputes regarding the calculation of design patent damages, including dueling expert opinions, thereby mirroring the challenges for damages calculations in utility patent cases. © 2016 Foley & Lardner LLP",

      "text": "Samsung ( SSNLF ) and Apple ( AAPL ) have been in a heated legal battle for nearly five years, and it isn't over yet.\nStill, Samsung won a decisive victory over the iPhone maker in their drawn-out patent case on Tuesday, Reuters reports.\nThe case, which is focused on design patents, dates back to 2011. Cupertino, Calif.-based Apple then accused the South Korean electronics conglomerate of stealing several hardware and software designs, including the iPhone's gridded icon design and rounded front face, on 11 different smartphone models.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court ruled 8-0 in favor of Samsung on Tuesday, tossing out a previous ruling from an appeals court that said Samsung would have to pay $399 million in damages. Tuesday's decision argues that violators in patent lawsuits do not necessarily have to pay the entire profit from items that have used stolen designs if the designs in question are only one component of the item.\nSamsung has already paid Apple $548 million in the lawsuit.\nThe case will be sent back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington to decide how much Samsung will pay Apple.\nOr in other words, here we go again.\nShares of Apple rose by less than 1% on Tuesday, closing at $109.92.",

      "text": "Samsung ( SSNLF ) does not have to pay smart phone rival Apple ( AAPL ) $399 million in a patent lawsuit, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled Tuesday.\nThe ruling comes as more of a moral victory than a financial score for Samsung, which had about $170 billion in fiscal year 2015 sales and has bigger problems to consider with the recall of its flagship Galaxy Note 7. Moreover, Samsung and Apple have settled patent fights outside the U.S.\nApple sued Samsung in 2011, charging that some Samsung smartphones infringed design patents for \"a rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen,\" the Supreme Court observed. The Federal Circuit court upheld a ruling that Samsung would have to pay Apple $399 million, or all of its profit from the smart phones in question.\nSamsung countered that it should not have to pay Apple all of its profits from the devices, since only the screen violated the patents.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that the court had to determine the precise \"article of manufacture\" that Samsung had improperly imitated.\n\"In the case of a design for a single-component product, such as a dinner plate, the product is the 'article of manufacture' to which the design has been applied,\" Sotomayor wrote. \"In the case of a design for a multicomponent product, such as a kitchen oven, identifying the 'article of manufacture' to which the design has been applied is a more difficult task.\"\nThe court decided, in an 8-0 vote, that the smart phones are more like an oven than a plate. The court sent the case back to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit in Washington, D.C., to determine the penalty.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "By SAM HANANEL\nAssociated Press WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court unanimously sided with smartphone maker Samsung on Tuesday in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone.\nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features it copied from the iPhone were only a part of Samsung's devices.\nCupertino, California-based Apple had won a $399 million judgment against South Korea-based Samsung for infringing parts of the iPhone's patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay.\nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangular shape of the phone and the layout of icons on the screen.\nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay \"total profit.\" Apple said that means all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied.\nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits.\nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve.\nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone's success was directly tied to its distinctive look.\nSamsung already has handed the $399 million over to Apple, but was hoping to get some of that money back with a favorable Supreme Court ruling. None of the early-generation Samsung phones involved in the lawsuit remains on the market.\nIn a statement, Apple said the company is optimistic that lower courts \"will again send a powerful signal that stealing isn't right.\"\n\"Our case has always been about Samsung's blatant copying of our ideas, and that was never in dispute,\" the company said. \"We will continue to protect the years of hard work that has made iPhone the world's most innovative and beloved product.\"\nSamsung in a statement called the ruling a victory \"for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace.\"\nThe patent battle between the technology titans was being closely watched by other industry giants. Companies including Google, Facebook and eBay sided with Samsung, arguing that the verdict was an excessive windfall for copying a few features of the iPhone.\nOn the other side, sportswear manufacturer Adidas and jewelry maker Tiffany & Co. said allowing Apple to recover all the profits Samsung earned would discourage \"design pirates\" and protect companies that invest in creative designs.\n\"This removes a threat for technology companies,\" said Janelle Waack, a Washington, D.C., lawyer specializing in patent law. \"The products that incorporate technology are not automatically going to get stung with a patent infringement suit that's going to cost them all of the profits from their product.\"\n ",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators.\nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple&apos;s Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale.\nCalifornia&apos;s Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators&apos; knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple&apos;s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale.\nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.\nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn&apos;t affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires.\nThe complaint filed against Apple didn&apos;t include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded.\nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn&apos;t authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators.\nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.\n ",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators.\nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale.\nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale.\nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.\nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires.\nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded.\nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators.\nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.\n ",

End user devices require careful orchestration CW500: The rocky road to software-defined everything Download Current Issue \nAustralia’s big banks have suffered a blow in their battle with Apple . A draft determination from the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) suggests the banks will not be granted leave to collectively bargain with, and boycott, Apple for up to three years over its Apple Pay service. A final determination will not handed down before March.

Of the majors, only ANZ currently offers its customers the Apple Pay service. \nThe other big banks’ core argument to the ACCC was that Australian iPhone users would only be able to use Apple Pay if they wanted a digital wallet service, which the banks said was anti-competitive. \nHowever, Australian consumers already have a variety of digital wallet options. For example, Android phones with built-in near field communications (NFC) chips are now being widely used as a platform for contactless digital payments. \nLance Blockley, a payments industry consultant who has been working with the banks on their ACCC submission, said: “If the draft determination of the Australian competition regulator stands, effectively there will be no competition against Apple for mobile payments on the iPhone. \n“The application has never been about preventing Apple Pay from coming to Australia or reducing competition between wallets. It has always been about providing consumer choice and innovation.” \nACCC chairman Rod Sims said: “This is currently a finely balanced decision. The ACCC is not currently satisfied that the likely benefits from the proposed conduct outweigh the likely detriments.” Read more about Apple Pay in Australia There are still uncertainties over Apple Pay among Australia’s big banks , but smaller finance firms are looking at ways to offer the payment service to their customers. Despite Australia being iPhone crazy, its banks are not exactly rushing to enable the payment process. \nSims noted that the banks could still offer their digital wallets on other smartphones, or offer accessories that would allow iPhone users to use their bank’s rather than Apple’s contactless payment service, so competition had not been thwarted. \nApple said in a statement: “We are focused on offering the easiest, most secure and private payment experience possible, and millions of Apple Pay users from 3,500 banks in 12 countries enjoy that today.” \nIt said the ACCC draft decision was “great for Australians and we look forward to continuing to work with individual banks in Australia and around the world to bring Apple Pay to their customers”. \nMeanwhile, Apple Pay is entering new areas. Cloud accounting software company Xero has announced that its users will be able to use Apple Pay and Stripe in combination to pay online invoices. Although theoretically this speeds up the transaction, it adds costs to the payment process, with both Stripe and Apple Pay collecting a transaction fee. \nDespite its slow progress in Australia, demand for Apple Pay is rising internationally. Commenting on Apple’s full-year results, CEO Tim Cook said transaction volumes for the service had risen by 500% during the year – although that comes off a very small base a year ago. \nIn Australia, the battle lines with the big banks are still being contested, however.

      "text": "Shares of Apple ( AAPL ) were higher in late afternoon trading on Tuesday, after CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that Apple Watch sales hit a record high during the first week of holiday shopping.\nWhile these numbers are positive, if Apple decided to \"write off the whole watch unit tomorrow, no one would even blink,\" Ritholtz Wealth Management CEO Josh Brown said on CNBC's \"Halftime Report\" on Tuesday afternoon. \"It's not a negative.\"\nBut if there's \"any upside\" in the watch division, then that leads to a good deal of positivity around Apple because it means that the tech giant can successfully launch a new product, Brown added. And that seems to be what Cook is saying - that there is upside here.\nWhile watch sales are improving, it will most likely never be the base driver at Apple, Najarian Family Office cofounder Peter Najarian claimed. \"The phone is still going to be what everyone is staring at, especially into the holidays.\"\nAfter talking with a number of portfolio managers, they seemed \"very excited\" about 2017 for Apple since the company underperformed this past year, Virtus Investment Partners managing director Joe Terranova noted. \"It almost feels as though they're getting a gift,\" he explained.\nApple also stands to gain from the expected launch of its 10th-anniversary iPhone next fall, as well as from the potential lower repatriated cash tax rate under President-elect Donald Trump, Terranova said. For these reasons, a lot of money managers will probably be reacquiring Apple in the first quarter of 2017.",

      "text": "Home » Latest News » Tech » Mobile » Apple pays $450,000 for… Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations   7:38 pm 12/06/2016 07:38pm Share \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple’s Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia’s Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators’ knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple’s devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. \nApple described its conduct as “an oversight in paperwork” that didn’t affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn’t include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the “baghouse” dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn’t authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.",

      "text": "Despite data showing slowing sales of smartwatches, sales of Apple 's ( AAPL ) Apple Watch hit record highs during the first week of holiday shopping, CEO Tim Cook told Reuters .\nCook said the wearable's sell-through has gained sharply and that the current quarter is poised to be the best ever for the Apple Watch.\n\"Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,\" Cook said, according to Reuters .\nHowever, Cook didn't provide detailed sales figures on the product. Apple doesn't break down sales of the Apple Watch in its earnings; instead it falls under the \"Other Products\" segment which includes Beats headphones, iPods and the Apple TV.\nIn its most recent quarter, sales in the Other Products category fell 22% year-over-year to $2.37 billion.\nThe comments follow a Monday report from market research firm IDC that said Apple sold 1.1 million Apple Watches in the third quarter of 2016, representing a 71% decrease year-over-year. This big decline was likely impacted by Apple's decision to launch its second-generation watches in mid-September, near the end of the quarter, according to IDC.\nAdditional IDC data suggests downbeat smartwatch sales in general. The firm estimates that industry shipments fell 52% in the third quarter to about 2.7 million.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

      "text": "This article originally appeared on Real Money.\nCompared with Apple's ( AAPL ) autonomous driving efforts and Tesla Motors' ( TSLA ) Autopilot 2.0 unveiling, the recent end of Baidu's ( BIDU ) self-driving car partnership hasn't received as much attention. But the unraveling of the alliance between a Chinese search giant and a top German automaker says a lot about the fault lines that are opening up as the auto industry gets self-driving religion. And why tech companies like Baidu, Alphabet ( GOOGL ) and (if reports about its efforts hold up) Apple may have a lot of convincing to do to win over auto giants.\nTwo years after BMW announced it was teaming with Baidu on self-driving car research, and a year after Baidu announced that a modified BMW 3-Series managed to drive an 18.6-mile route around Beijing on its own, the companies say they plan to go their own ways. Baidu now plans to test its self-driving systems on cars from Ford's Lincoln and Chinese automakers Chery, BYD and BAIC Motor, and says it's looking for new R&D partners.\nThe partnership's demise shouldn't have been too shocking, since BMW announced in July it aims to bring a self-driving car to market by 2021 with Intel and vision processor developer Mobileye's ( MBLY ) help. Baidu, for its part, wants to make self-driving shuttles available in China by the end of 2018, and fully autonomous cars by 2021.\nBMW certainly isn't alone among automakers in trying to develop a proprietary autonomous driving solution. Ford ( F ) is also looking to bring a home-grown self-driving car to market by 2021, and has made a series of acquisitions and investments to reach its goal. This June, Toyota ( TM ) announced it's spending $1 billion to create the Toyota Research Institute, whose efforts will focus on autonomous driving and robotics. And last week, Volkswagen said it's spinning off a new company called Moia that will focus on things like ride-hailing and autonomous driving.\nMajor automakers have long been well-represented among the ranks of the world's biggest R&D spenders, as they pour billions in developing new cars and the technology that goes into them. For the time being at least, many of these companies don't seem any more interested in letting third parties supply the autonomous driving systems their cars will use than in outsourcing engine, drivetrain or chassis development.\nAlphabet and Apple are holdings in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio .

      "text": "Stock futures edged higher on Tuesday as Apple ( AAPL ) climbed in premarket trading after assurances its Apple Watch was performing well in sales ahead of Christmas.\nS&P 500 futures were up 0.15%, Dow Jones Industrial Average futures rose 0.07% and Nasdaq futures added 0.2%.\nApple rose 1% before the bell after CEO Tim Cook told Reuters that sales of the Apple Watch were rising and that the smartwatch would likely hold rank as one of the holiday season's most popular gifts. Cook did not disclose sales data.\n\"Sales growth is off the charts,\" said Cook. \"In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell-through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history. And as we expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.\"\nCook's assurances come after a report from IDC on Monday that found Apple Watch shipments in the third quarter had dropped 71% from a year earlier.\nApple is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio.

Exports fell 1.8% in October, while imports increased 1.3%, hitting a 14-month high.\nU.S. productivity in the third quarter was unchanged at 3.1%, the Labor Department said. Economists surveyed by FactSet had expected a revised figure of up 3.2%. Output of goods and services was revised to show 3.6% growth from 3.4% growth.

      "text": "Click to share on Pinterest (Opens in new window) FILE - In this Dec. 12, 2013 file photo, a man passes by the Samsung Electronics Co. logos at its headquarters in Seoul, South Korea. A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016, sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. The justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon, File) \nWASHINGTON (AP) — A unanimous Supreme Court on Tuesday sided with smartphone maker Samsung in its high-profile patent dispute with Apple over design of the iPhone. \nThe justices said Samsung may not be required to pay all the profits it earned from 11 phone models because the features at issue are only a tiny part of the devices. \nApple had won a $399 million judgment against Samsung for copying parts of the iPhone’s patented design, but the case now returns to a lower court to decide what Samsung must pay. \nThe case is part of a series of disputes between the technology rivals that began in 2011. Apple accused Samsung of duplicating a handful of distinctive iPhone features for which Apple holds patents: the flat screen, the rounded rectangle shape of the phone, and the layout of icons on the screen. \nAt issue was how much Samsung is required to compensate Apple under an 1887 law that requires patent infringers to pay “total profit.” Apple said that meant all the profits from the phone sales, while Samsung argued it was limited to profits related to the specific components that were copied. \nJustice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the court that the law does not require damages to be based on the entire product, but can be limited to only a component of the product. The decision overturned a ruling from a federal appeals court in Washington, which said that Apple was entitled to all the profits. \nBut the high court declined to lay out a specific test for how such damage awards should be calculated. Sotomayor said doing so was not necessary and the justices left it up to lower courts to resolve. \nSamsung had argued that the hefty award ignored the fact that its phones contain more than 200,000 other patents that Apple does not own. Apple said the verdict was fair because the iPhone’s success was directly tied to its distinctive look. Share this:",

      "text": "In the dearth of major Android Wear smartwatches , it is clear that at least two brands will be able to prosper this holiday season. One of them is led by a very happy Tim Cook .\nIn an email exchange with Reuters , the Apple CEO said that the Apple Watch’s weekly sell-through rate — that is actual sales to consumers and not store shipments — has reached a record high. That high should take the product to its “best quarter ever.”\nSure, the Watch has been out for about six quarters so far , but with fitness trackers remaining the dominant force in wearable tech and the fact that third-quarter shipments for Apple’s wrist-worn wares compared terribly year-over-year in an IDC report , the news may have seemed pertinent to share publicly.\n“Our data shows that Apple Watch is doing great and looks to be one of the most popular holiday gifts this year,” Cook wrote.\nWe will likely not be told the final number of units sold for Apple’s first fiscal quarter — the Apple Watch is usually reported within the “other products” line in earnings data sets.\nThe post Tim Cook super-excited for Apple Watch holiday sales appeared first on Pocketnow .\n",

      "text": "apple vs samsung supreme court More On Tuesday, a years-long courtroom battle between Samsung and Apple — one that began way back in 2011, when Apple filed a patent lawsuit against the Seoul, South Korea-based electronics company for infringing on its iPhone’s iconic design — came to a suitably dramatic end. In a unanimous decision, the U.S. Supreme Court threw out the almost $400 million in damages Samsung had been ordered to pay Apple by a lower court.\nAt issue before the Court was how the damages were to be calculated. Samsung, which was ruled to have violated Apple’s design patents by a jury in 2012, initially found itself on the hook for the profits generated by each of the 11 patents determined to have to have infringed. Effectively, the company would have had to pay Apple a percentage of each sale. The justices disagreed, ruling that the company only needed to pay damages on the infringing components of those smartphones, rather than the smartphones themselves.\nMore: Apple marketing VP Phil Schiller responds to backlash over MacBook Pro design\nThey were persuaded by the “text of the law,” The Hill reports . In delivering the Court’s majority opinion, Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote that “article of manufacture” — the legal term that refers to both a product sold to a consumer and a component of said product — has a “broad meaning,” and that an “article” could refer to “a particular thing.” In Samsung’s case, an “article” could be an infringing smartphone’s appearance, for instance, or software feature.\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit will now determine exact damages, but they’re likely to be far less than the hundreds of millions Samsung might have otherwise paid. The company faced $1 billion in penalties, a total representing all profits generated by the infringing smartphones. That fine was subsequently reduced to $548 million.\n“We decline to lay out a test for the first step of the damages inquiry in the absence of adequate breifing by the parties,” Sotomayor said. “The Federal Circuit may address any remaining issues on remand.”\nRecalling the design of the Volkswagen Beetle To understand the line of questioning from the Supreme Court justices to the two firms’ attorneys, you need to take a look at the law and the argument in the case.\nDesign patents, as the name suggests, protect the unique look of a product. Utility patents protect the functional parts of a product. In the original 2012 case , Apple sued Samsung saying it copied various design patents of the iPhone. The jury ended up siding with Apple, agreeing that Samsung copied the black rectangle shape and rounded corners, the bezel, and a patent that covered the graphical layout of icons on the iPhone. The Korean giant was ordered to pay “total profits” of the phones in question.\n“Whoever during the term of a patent for a design, without license of the owner, applies the patented design, or any colorable imitation thereof, to any article of manufacture for the purpose of sale, or sells or exposes for sale any article of manufacture to which such design or colorable imitation has been applied shall be liable to the owner to the extent of his total profit , but not less than $250, recoverable in any United States district court having jurisdiction of the parties,” the law states (emphasis ours).\nSamsung, and many of its supporters, believe the reward for infringing a design patent should not involve the “total profits.” Since a smartphone is filled with thousands of patented components, infringing design patents should not amount to the total profit of the smartphone. Apple counters that the whole design sells the phone — removing the need to pay total profits would hamper legal protection for new products and design.\nMore: Samsung has finally killed the Galaxy Note 7\nIn recent court filings, Apple has said while “total profit” should mean that Samsung has to pay the total profit of a sale, “article of manufacturer” could mean specific features and not the whole product. The company said in court that significant financial damage would deter people from stealing designs of products.\nOne line of questioning that was prevalent throughout the hearing concerned how to identify the value of a design from the overall product, according to CNET .\nRead More “If I was a juror, I wouldn’t know what to do,” Justice Anthony Kennedy reportedly said. Justices were skeptical about Samsung’s argument, according to The Verge , as Justice Sonia Sotomayor suggested that the design of a phone “might drive the sale.”\nThe design of the original Volkswagen Beetle was brought up, as it features many components inside it. Justice Samuel Alito said design was important, but it isn’t the only driving force behind sales.\n“Nobody buys a car, even a Beetle, just because they like the way it looks,” Justice Alito said, according to the Verge.\nBut while the car has to perform all the other functions cars are expected to do, Justice Elena Kagan said perhaps its design was indeed a primary motivator in sales.\nMore: After a slow start last month, iOS 10 now being run on a majority of Apple devices\nIn its brief , Samsung raised the point that if Apple wins, it would mean someone who infringes on the design of a “patented cupholder” may have to pay the entire profits on a car. It’s why Samsung wants “articles of manufacturing” to mean the specific components of a phone, rather than the whole phone itself.\n“The infringement wasn’t found on the whole phone,” Samsung attorney Kathleen Sullivan said after the hearing. “It asserted three narrow patents. The patent doesn’t apply to the internals of the phone, so Apple doesn’t deserve profits on all of Samsung’s phone.”\nShe said awarding total profits for infringing design patents would “devalue” the other important patents in a smartphone, according to CNET. A device typically has about 250,000 patented features, Sullivan noted.\n“We firmly believe that strong design patent protection spurs creativity and innovation,” said Noreen Krall, Apple’s chief litigation officer, after the hearing. “And that’s why we’ve defended ourselves against those who steal our ideas. Eleven times now, Samsung has been found guilty of intentionally and blatantly copying the iPhone. Every court at every level has agreed. We think that’s wrong and that it poses chilling risks to the future of design innovation.”\nThe Supreme Court has not ruled on a design patent case for more than a 100 years, so it is hard to see how this will play out. Suggestions were raised to send the case to lower courts, while the Supreme Court creates new rules on how damages for infringing design patents are awarded and judged.\nA brief history It all began six years ago in 2010, when the iPhone-maker warned Samsung that the Korean giant’s tablets and smartphones infringed on Apple patents. The company did not sue immediately because Samsung was a “trusted partner” — Apple spent billions of dollars on Samsung screens, processors, and other components.\nApple had already gone after another tech giant, HTC, in the same year. The two settled with a cross-licensing patent deal in 2012.\nMore: Why are Apple and Samsung throwing down? A timeline of the biggest fight in tech\nIn October 2010, executives from Samsung and Apple meet and the latter suggests Samsung pay $30 per phone and $40 per tablet for infringing on design patents with the iPhone and iPad. Earlier in the year, HTC agreed to pay Microsoft $5 for every Android device ever sold. Apple’s suggestion was too high for Samsung and the company declined.\nApple sued Samsung the following year for “slavishly” copying the iPhone’s design. Samsung countersued for 3G patents, and filed claims in Germany, Japan, and South Korea.\nThe next six years involved Apple getting judges to ban Samsung devices in various countries including an iPhone and iPad sales ban in Germany that lasted a few hours, failed settlement talks, and even forcing Samsung and Google to scale back the universal search bar on the Galaxy Nexus and Galaxy S3. In the U.K., Apple also had to post a public apology that said Samsung did not copy its designs.\nIn 2012, however, a trial court verdict was reached in the U.S. The jury sided with Apple, awarding the U.S company $1 billion in damages. That did not stop the iPhone maker, as it quickly followed up with another lawsuit that targeted newer Samsung devices. In 2013, the judge that presided over the first case found that the damages Samsung had to pay were calculated incorrectly . Around $450 million of the $1 billion was invalidated and a retrial kicked off later in the year.\nIn another blow to Samsung, the retrial earned Apple an additional $290 million in damages, bringing the total Samsung has to pay to $929 million, a little short of the original $1 billion victory. Samsung immediately appealed the decision. In December 2015, Samsung agreed to pay $548 million to Apple.\nThat amount was based off total profits made by Samsung — and this is where the Supreme Court comes in.\nWho’s with Apple More than a hundred designers and educators support Apple. They are industry professionals and have provided product design services to companies such as Apple, AT&T, Calvin Klein, Coca-Cola, Ford, General Electric, General Motors, Hewlett-Packard, Google, IBM, the New York Stock Exchange, NASA, Samsung, and more.\nMore: Designers including Calvin Klein file amicus brief supporting Apple in patent case with Samsung\nSome other notable names include Raymond Riley, executive creative director at Microsoft, Bruce Claxton, the former senior director of design at Motorola Solutions, Calvin Klein, the founder of the fashion brand, Sohrab Vossoughi, a former senior industrial designer at HP, and others.\nWho’s with Samsung A host of Silicon Valley companies are rooting for Samsung, including Google, Facebook, eBay, Dell, HP, Newegg, Vizio, and a smaller coalition of other tech firms. Non-profits like the Electronic Frontier Foundation also support the South Korean giant, as do 50 intellectual property professors from universities like Stanford, Georgetown, Notre Dame, and more.\nWhat happens after? Samsung’s win sets a precedent that could affect other design cases. And depending on the lower court’s decision, it could mean Samsung owes less money to Apple.\nIf Apple were to have won, Samsung would’ve had to pay up, and there likely would have been more trials related to other design patent cases between the two.\nThe decision won’t impact consumers, but it will affect how future design patent disputes are handled.\nArticle originally published in October 2016.

      "text": "  Apple , Samsung Samsung wins over Apple in US$399m patent appeal Decrease Font Size Increase Font Size Text Size Print This Page Washington – The US Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a $399 million penalty imposed on Samsung for copying Apple’s iPhone design, in a case watched closely for patent infringement in the digital era. The justices ruled 8-0 that Samsung should not be required to forfeit the entire profits from its smartphones for infringement on design components, sending the case back to a lower court. The 11-page ruling found that the $399 million penalty — one element of a major patent infringement case — was inappropriate because it represented “Samsung’s entire profit from the sale of its infringing smartphones” for copying the iPhone’s “rectangular front face with rounded edges and a grid of colorful icons on a black screen.” But the court stopped short of delving into details of the degree to which the patent infringement should affect the penalty. “The parties ask us to go further and resolve whether, for each of the design patents at issue here, the relevant article of manufacture is the smartphone, or a particular smartphone component,” Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in the opinion. “Doing so would require us to set out a test for identifying the relevant article of manufacture… and to parse the record to apply that test in this case.” The court sent the case back to the appellate court in Washington to resolve the details. The case is one element of the $548 million penalty — knocked down from an original $1 billion jury award — Samsung was ordered to pay for copying iPhone patents. No clarity Observers had been watching to see how the court — which had not taken up a design patent case in more than a century — would tip the balance between technological innovation and protecting intellectual property. Dennis Crouch, a University of Missouri law professor and co-director of the Center for Intellectual Property and Entrepreneurship, said the ruling may leave both sides disappointed because it sets no real precedent. “Although the case offers hope for Samsung and others adjudged of infringing design patents, it offers no clarity as to the rule of law,” Crouch said in a blog post. Crouch said the court allowed for damages to be applied at the component level but also indicated that the product as a whole is “an article of manufacture,” leaving the matter open to interpretation. “Thus, it will be up to courts to figure out which level applies in particular cases,” he wrote. Samsung won the backing of major Silicon Valley and other IT sector giants, including Google, Facebook, Dell and Hewlett-Packard, claiming a strict ruling on design infringement could lead to a surge in litigation. Apple was supported by big names in fashion and manufacturing. Design professionals, researchers and academics who said they had no financial interest in the case filed an amicus brief arguing on the basis of “fundamental principles of visual design.” Eric Goldman, director of the High Tech Law Institute at Santa Clara University, said that even if the court did not offer precise details it did strike down the notion that design infringement of a component should require the loss of all profits from a device. “By rejecting the most aggressive plaintiff position, it should increase the parties’ ability to find appropriate settlement amounts,” Goldman told AFP. – AFP",

      "text": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators.\nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale.\nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale.\nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.\nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires.\nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded.\nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators.\nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.\n ",

California's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. Regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Apple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. The complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. Regulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. Settling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. Latest News",

(Source: Wikimedia Commons) The US Supreme Court has ruled 8-0 in favor of Samsung's appeal to reverse up to US$399 million of the US$548 million in damages already paid to Apple. by Douglas Black, 2016/12/07 Apple Smartwatch Working For Notebookcheck Are you a loyal reader of notebookcheck? Are you a techie who knows how to write? Then join our Team! Especially wanted: German-English-Translator - Details here The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) has ruled 8-0 in favor of Korean Smartphone giant Samsung, reversing 2 lower-court decisions made in favor of Apple that culminated with 2012 in US$548 million in damages. The SCOTUS agreed with Samsung's claim that the infringement damages should be based on the design elements copied and not the entire phone (as awarded). The previous lower-court victories for Apple awarded them damages over utility and design patents, including grids of icons and rounded corners. In December, 2015, Samsung paid the full amount to Apple, but pledged that it would fight to get at least some of it back. That fight of appeal continued until the SCOTUS's decision today. The legal drama will continue, however, as lower courts assess exactly how much of the damages Apple should pay back to Samsung. Asked for comment by Tech Crunch, Samsung responded with the following: \"The U.S. Supreme Court’s landmark decision today is a victory for Samsung and for all those who promote creativity, innovation and fair competition in the marketplace. We thank our supporters from the world’s leading technology companies, the 50 intellectual property professors, and the many public policy groups who stood with us as we fought for a legal environment that fairly rewards invention and fosters innovation.\" See our Top 10 Notebooks:",

      "text": "Technology News | Tue Dec 6, 2016 | 10:57pm EST Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nBEIJING Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Next In Technology News Trump claims $50 billion SoftBank investment due to his election win \nNEW YORK The head of Japan's SoftBank Group Corp , which in October set up a $100 billion fund for technology investments, said on Tuesday he would invest $50 billion in U.S. businesses, a move President-elect Donald Trump claimed was a direct result of his election win.",

      "text": "Business News | Wed Dec 7, 2016 | 3:59am GMT Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors Details are pictured on the backside of an Apple Iphone 6 on a table in a restaurant in Hanau, Germany, April 10, 2016. REUTERS/Kai Pfaffenbach/File Photo \nBEIJING Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) Next In Business News",

      "text": "Apple pays $450,000 for alleged hazardous waste violations Posted: # Comments \nSAN FRANCISCO (AP)  Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. \nThe agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. \nCalifornia's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Advertisement \nApple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. \nThe complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. \nRegulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. \nSettling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash.",

      "author": "The Associated Press 7:38 p.m Tuesday, Dec. 6, 2016 National/World News 0 SAN FRANCISCO Apple is paying $450,000 to settle allegations that the iPhone maker operated and closed two hazardous-waste processing plants without submitting the proper paperwork to California environmental regulators. The agreement announced Tuesday involves a now-closed plant near Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters and another one in nearby Sunnyvale. California's Department of Toxic Substances Control alleged Apple opened, ran and then closed the Cupertino plant without regulators' knowledge. The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013, when the operations were moved to Sunnyvale. Regulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there. Apple described its conduct as \"an oversight in paperwork\" that didn't affect its health and safety standards, which the company says are even more stringent than the law requires. The complaint filed against Apple didn't include any allegations that anyone or the environment was harmed. But state regulators did accuse of Apple of mishandling fine dust vacuumed up from the Sunnyvale plant in 2013 after some devices were shredded. Regulators say the \"baghouse\" dust included hazardous levels of copper, zinc and other particles that were improperly sent to a recycling center in Roseville, California, located about 140 miles away. The Roseville center wasn't authorized to store or treat the hazardous waste before it was sent to Canada, according to regulators. Settling the case cost Apple a relative pittance. The company ended September with nearly $238 billion in cash. View Comments 0 Sign up for e-newsletters Want more news? Sign up for free e-newsletters to get more of AJC delivered to your inbox.

Jennifer Bailey, who leads Apple Pay, spoke today at the Code Commerce conference in San Fransisco and said that in the span of just two years Apple has managed to move from four to 35 percent of retailers (or 4 million locations) supporting Apple Pay in the US. Apple is also targeting big retailers for the next year, including GAP, to increase that growth.\n\nBailey says that EMV chip cards are annoying for consumers (she’s right), and that’s helping to drive adoption. “Once you figure out you have to dip, you wait awhile, you wait awhile,” Bailey said. Then she went so far as to mimic the annoying “BEEP BEEP BEEP” that those chip card...",

The plant processed about 1.1 million pounds of waste created by Apple's devices during a two-year period before closing in 2013 and moving the operations to Sunnyvale. \nRegulators say Apple processed about 803,000 pounds of electronic waste in Sunnyvale before notifying the state about its activities there.

      "text": "  9:27am IST Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nBEIJING Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing)  ",

      "text": "Shanghai (AFP) - Apple has blamed \"external physical damage\" for causing a handful of iPhones to explode or catch fire in China and insisted that its handsets posed no safety problem. Fresh on the heels of Samsung's worldwide Galaxy Note 7 safety fiasco, a Shanghai consumer watchdog said last Friday it had received eight recent reports of iPhones that spontaneously combusted while being used or charged.\nIn a statement to AFP late Tuesday, the US tech giant said it had retrieved units for analysis and conducted thorough tests on phones which had experienced \"thermal events\", but brushed off safety concerns.\n\"The units we’ve analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" the statement said.\n\"We treat safety as a top priority and have found no cause for concern with these products.\"\nThe company also denied being slow to respond, after the state-run Shanghai Consumer Council had urged it to address consumer complaints.\nThe watchdog's report quoted one woman as saying her iPhone 6s Plus exploded in August, shattering the screen and leaving the battery and back of the phone blackened.\nThe council said it had received a sixfold surge in total complaints against Apple in the past two months, including sudden shutdowns of the iPhone 6 and 6s even though batteries still had enough power.\nThe council did not say where the complaining iPhone users were located.\nApple last month offered to change iPhone 6s batteries for Chinese users who complained of the sudden shutdowns, but said the problem did not constitute a safety issue.\nSamsung suffered a severe blow over its Galaxy Note 7's woes, recalling some 2.5 million units after reports of the product catching fire.",

      "title": "iPhone 7 Plus Camera Lauded For Apple's 'Romeo And Juliet' Ad",
      "text": "Comment YouTube screengrab \nWe all more or less know just how great that Apple’s cameras in their iPhone family has performed all this while, basically being the king of the hill. However, this does not mean that other companies and its rivals are simply going to let Apple run away with such strength with each successive generation of smartphones, and the current generation of flagship smartphones certainly yields some pretty interesting results when it comes to the best smartphone camera. Still, this is not to say that you will not be able to obtain some cool looking photos and videos with Apple’s latest iPhone 7 Plus . In fact, Apple trumpets the ability of the iPhone 7 Plus’ camera by releasing its most recent ad titled ‘Romeo and Juliet’. \nThe ‘Romeo and Juliet’ ad is touching when you view it above, conveying a heart tugging moment in just half a minute. The main purpose of the ad is not to help you realize that life is worth living because of love, but rather, to highlight the capabilities and extent of performance which the dual-camera system that the iPhone 7 Plus possesses. \nThis particular ‘Romeo and Juliet’ ad spot will concentrate on Act II Scene II of Shakespeare's masterpiece. Also well known among the masses as the balcony scene, Capulet's Orchard would be one of the most famous scenes where theater is concerned. Children would be the ones playing the roles in Apple’s take of the scene, as we are reminded that the main star of this ad would be the iPhone 7 Plus. \nOpening with a cinematic shot, the ad continues to showcase other potential situations that everyday smartphone users would encounter and would like to capture on video for posterity: including exterior shots as well as night time moments. When a young and blushing Juliet realizes that her Romeo is around, she then quickly makes a dash for the balcony, crying out the immortal line, \"O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?\" \nApple’ decided to cut straight to the chase in this particular version, delivering Romeo's response, \"Call me but love.\" Eventually, the ad will then be cut to a shot where a man holds the iPhone 7 Plus, with his eyes welling up at the edges. It seems that this is but a school play that is seen through the father of the girl who plays Juliet, and this man is part of the audience, who wants to film the entire proceedings so that he can immortalize the moment. Do you think that the day will come when entire movies will be shot on nothing but a mobile device? After all, we have heard whispers that part of The Avengers were captured on an iPhone in the past, although chances are it would not be any of the major scenes that required much detail. With the iPhone 7 Plus, amateur videography will certainly continue to bloom thanks to the dual-camera system and its capabilities, not to mention this ad ending with the tagline \"Your movies look like movies on iPhone 7.\"",

      "title": "Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors",
      "text": "A \nBEIJING: Apple said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted - handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov 20 to address the issue. \n\"The units we've analysed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,\" an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea's Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung's recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2,763 - itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n\"The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn't necessarily equal a safe product,\" said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council's report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n\"I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it's not investigated,\" said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n\"The news did make me change my Apple habits,\" he told Reuters. \"For example, I don't dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.\" \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing) - Reuters",

      "text": "By Stephen Nellis\n(Reuters) - The California Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday said Apple Inc agreed to pay $450,000 to settle state claims that it had mishandled hazardous electronic waste at facilities in Silicon Valley.\nApple also agreed to increase inspections to settle allegations about facilities in Cupertino and Sunnyvale, the Agency's Department of Toxic Substances Control said.\n\"This matter involves an oversight in filing paperwork to close one of our recycling facilities as part of our expansion to a larger site,\" Apple spokeswoman Alisha Johnson told Reuters in an emailed statement.\n\"We've worked closely with [the Department of Toxic Substance Control] to ensure that going forward we have the proper permits for our current site. As we do with all our facilities, we followed our stringent set of health and safety standards, which go well beyond legal requirements.\"\nState regulators alleged Apple opened and operated an electronic waste shredding facility in Cupertino, its home base, between 2011 and 2012 without informing them.\nThe department also alleged Apple mishandled metal dust from shredder operations at the Cupertino facility, which processed about 1.1 million pounds (500,000 kg) of waste before it was closed in January 2013.\nRegulators also said that Apple subsequently opened another shredding facility in nearby Sunnyvale and processed 800,000 pounds of waste before notifying the regulators of the plant's existence. At the Sunnyvale plant, regulators alleged, Apple took hazardous dust swept from the floor and sent it to a disposal site that was not authorized to handle toxic waste.\nThe regulators also claim Apple did not properly report and track exports of hazardous waste and failed to mark used oil containers properly as hazardous waste.\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis; Editing by Dan Grebler and Alan Crosby)",

      "text": "Search for: Apple says iPhone 6 battery fires in China likely caused by external factors iPhones sit on display during a preview event at the new Apple Store Williamsburg in Brooklyn, New York, U.S., July 28, 2016. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly \nDecember 7, 2016 \nBEIJING (Reuters) – Apple Inc said external factors were the likely cause of iPhone 6 battery fires detailed in a Chinese consumer protection report that featured widely in state media earlier this week and created a buzz on social media. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council released a report on Friday detailing battery fires in eight iPhone 6 handsets. It also detailed iPhone 6 handsets powering down before their batteries are depleted – handsets outside of a global iPhone 6 recall range that Apple announced on Nov. 20 to address the issue. \n“The units we’ve analyzed so far have clearly shown that external physical damage happened to them which led to the thermal event,” an Apple spokeswoman said in an emailed statement to Reuters late on Tuesday. She also said Apple was widening its investigation into the power-down issue. \nThe U.S. tech firm has seen Chinese sales fall over the past three quarters as domestic smartphone makers compete with high-spec handsets at low price points. It is hoping to bounce back in the first quarter of next year with its iPhone 7. \nBut domestic handset makers also likely received a boost after South Korea’s Samsung Electronics Co Ltd recalled 2.5 million Note 7 handsets globally following a series of battery fires, raising distrust of foreign smartphone brands, according to users, analysts and consumer groups. \nThe Shanghai Consumer Council in its report said that during Samsung’s recall in October-November, complaints involving Apple products jumped, accounting for almost half the year-to-date total of 2763 – itself a nearly two-fold increase from 2015. \n“The Samsung case did make (Chinese smartphone users) start to think an international brand doesn’t necessarily equal a safe product,” said Nicole Peng, Asia-Pacific director at researcher Canalys. \nState media outlets featuring the Shanghai council’s report on Monday garnered tens of thousands of comments on social media. While many doubted the iPhone 6 was at fault, top-ranking comments expressed frustration that foreign brands could set high prices and yet not guarantee safety. \n“I still worry about the iPhone in case there is indeed a problem, but it’s not investigated,” said Mr. Liu, a 21-year-old student in Beijing. \n“The news did make me change my Apple habits,” he told Reuters. “For example, I don’t dare play with the phone in bed and if it heats up I quickly throw it aside.” \n(Reporting by Cate Cadell; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

      "text": "Apple Blames “Ambient Air” For iPhone 6S Battery Problem Image courtesy of TechStage blame it on the air iphone iphone 6s apple excuses \nA few weeks ago, Apple admitted that some iPhone 6S batteries were not working properly, causing the phones to shut down suddenly during otherwise normal use, and launched a repair program for affected consumers. But Apple hadn’t said why the batteries weren’t working properly… until this week, when it blamed the problem on air. Yes, literally air. \nYou might think that air is sort of, you know, ubiquitous on Earth, and you’d be right. But the wrong kind or amount of air at the wrong part of a delicate manufacturing process is actually a problem, and that’s what Apple’s pointing to. \nIn a recent press release (h/t The Verge ), Apple writes that the affected phones “contained a battery component that was exposed to controlled ambient air longer than it should have been” before the battery packs were fully assembled. That means the issue with the batteries is due to a flaw in the manufacturing process, not in the design. So new batteries made more carefully, using the same design, should work properly. \nExcept… that may not be the only problem. Apple also adds that a “small number of customers outside of the affected range” are also reporting sudden shutdown issues. Apple did not say if the issue is related to the battery-draining iOS update that some users report experiencing, but to pin it down, everyone’s iOS is getting an update next week to include “additional diagnostic capability.” \nWith that data-gathering ability, Apple hopes to narrow down the performance issues and, ideally, be able to update battery performance management with a software patch.

      "text": "\nWhat were the best apps, games, music, movies, TV, books, and podcasts of 2016? Here are Apple's picks!\nEvery December Apple's App Store and iTunes editorial teams put together lists of what they believe to be the very best content of the year. That includes apps, games, music, movies, TV, books, and podcasts — everything available on Apple's digital download stores. In addition to the favorites, Apple also highlights the most popular items in each category, which is effectively a \"customer's choice award\" all it's own. So what were the big winners of 2016?\nApps : For apps, Prisma for iPhone, Sketchbook Motion for iPad, Twitter for Apple TV, and MySwimPro - Personal Swim Trainer for Apple Watch. For games, Clash Royale for iPhone, Severed for iPad, Riptide GP: Renegade for Apple TV and Field Day for Apple Watch. Most popular was Snapchat, though Pokémon Go placed as well. Minecraft: Pocket Edition was the most downloaded paid iPad app, and YouTube the top free iPad app.\nMusic : Chance the Rapper, Frank Ocean, Skepta, Christine And The Queens, Kiiara, The 1975, Kanye West, The Weeknd, and DJ Khaled all showed, and Beats 1 will be doing a countdown show on December 7. Drake, the Hamilton soundtrack, Chainsmokers, Adele, Rihanna and Frank Ocean topped the download charts.\nMovies : La La Land, Kubo & the Two Strings, Sing Street all placed. Star Wars: The Force Awakens, Deadpool, Spotlight, and The Hateful Eight ruled the charts.\nTV : Full Frontal with Samantha Bee and Atlanta as the Late Night Rule-Breaker and Best New Comedy, Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and Downton Abbey were all popular hits.\nBooks : Moonglow and Evicted were the favorites. The Girl on the Train and Me Before You were in the charts, while Harry Potter dominated audiobooks.\nPodcasts : My Favorite Murder and 2 Dope Queens topped the picks. Fresh Air from NPR, the charts.\nMy picks would have had some overlap with Apple's, but also some major differences. What about you? What were your favorites of 2016?\n",
