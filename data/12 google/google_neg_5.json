      "text": "PhotoScan by Google for Android and iPhone Wants to Help Digitise Your Old Photos Reddit \nGoogle wants to make digitizing your many boxes of old photo prints as easy as opening an app. \nThe PhotoScan app for iPhones and Android phones will use the phone's camera to capture an old photo in four sections and stitch them together, much like a panorama shot. Google says this approach helps eliminate glare that can mar attempts to digitize a print by simply photographing the whole photo. \nThe app will make minor adjustments to restore color in faded photos and to aligned corners when the photo print is bent. \nJulia Winn, a product manager for the new app, said scanning photos with traditional scanners takes time, while third-party digitizing services cost money and require you to part with your photos temporarily, risking loss and damage. \nThe free app, released Tuesday, will work with photos on a table, a picture frame and an album. It will also digitize slides when projected on a wall. Winn said the resolution of the digitized photo will be comparable to that from a flatbed scanner. You can store digitized versions on your phone or the online Google Photos service, which has unlimited storage for photos of up to 16 megapixels.\nOther photo features announced Tuesday include: \n- The main Google Photos app is getting additional editing controls. There are new filters for those who like automation and more granular controls for those who prefer manual editing. The new manual options include \"deep blue\" to give skies and water more color, without oversaturating the rest of the photo, and \"skin tone\" to adjust only the colors on skins. \n- The service will also automatically generate additional types of video highlights, with background music, from your collection of photos and videos. The service initially organized images only around location and date. It recently started creating reels following a kid growing up. A new type, called lullaby, will gather shots from a newborn's initial days. Coming next month: Christmas shots and happy moments from 2016. Pets and outdoor videos are coming in 2017.",

      "text": "Google expands mission to make automated translations suck less Neural Machine Translation is now used to decipher English, German and Japanese and a few others. Share Save \nWhat started with Mandarin Chinese is expanding to English; French; German; Japanese; Korean; Portuguese and Turkish, as Google has increased the languages its Neural Machine Translation (NMT) handle. \"These represent the native languages of around one-third of the world's population, covering more than 35 percent of all Google Translate queries,\" according to The Keyword blog. The promise here is that because NMT uses the context of the entire sentence, rather than translating individual words on their own, the results will be more accurate, especially as time goes on, thanks to machine learning . For a comparison of the two methods, check out the GIF embedded below. \nGoogle says that the ultimate goal is to have all 103 languages in Translate using machine learning. In the immediate future, though, it's opening up the NMT tech to businesses so they can use it how they see fit. If that increase in users means better translations, then, hey, everyone wins.",

      "title": "Google to build 1 million square foot building in post-Brexit London",
      "text": "(Reuters) – Google delivered a vote of confidence in London’s future as a technological hub after the Brexit vote on Tuesday by announcing plans for a new building in the King’s Cross area of the city that will house thousands of extra engineers.\nGoogle’s Chief Executive Sundar Pichai said computer science had a great future in Britain, citing the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation present in the country.\n“That’s why we are investing in London in both engineering talent and infrastructure,” he said.\nThe 10-storey building, Google’s first wholly owned and designed outside the United States, will increase its presence in King’s Cross to more than 1 million square feet, enough for more than 7,000 employees in total, the company said.\nGoogle has 5,700 employees and contractors in the UK, including about 2,000 engineers housed in the recently opened building in King’s Cross where Pichai announced the expansion.\nPichai, who became CEO in October 2015 when parent company Alphabet was created, said he was optimistic about Britain’s future, despite the uncertainty caused by June’s vote to leave the European Union.\n“Historically, the UK has been an open and connected economy, and like a lot of businesses we are proud of and rely on the fact that we recruit the best talent from around world,” he said. “We are optimistic that this situation will continue.”\n“We understand there is uncertainty and even concerns about topics like Brexit and the pace of technological change in our times, but we know for certain that web and digital technology will be an engine of growth for the UK for years to come.”\nBritish Finance Minister Philip Hammond said the investment showed leading firms were still choosing to invest in Britain, while the Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said inflows remain “robust” post-Brexit.\n“London isn’t just the tech capital of Europe, we are on the shoulder of New York and we are catching up with Silicon Valley,” Khan said at the event.\n“Investment into the capital post-Brexit remains robust, so Google’s expansion will further strengthen our city’s reputation as a global leader in digital technology.”\nPichai made reference in his speech to another event that exposed a division in a western society: the U.S. election.\n“Recent events, including the election in the U.S., have clearly surfaced challenges with inequality and people feeling marginalized,” he said.\nThese were “long-term and difficult” problems to solve, he said, but it was his hope that Google would play a constructive role in addressing some of these challenges.\nThe company, along with Facebook, on Monday announced measures aimed at halting the spread of “fake news” on the internet by targeting how some purveyors of phony content make money: advertising.\nThe shifts comes as Google, Facebook and Twitter face a backlash over the role they played in the U.S. presidential election by allowing the spread of false and often malicious information that might have swayed voters toward Republican candidate Donald Trump, who won the Nov. 8 vote.\n(Additional reporting by Andy Bruce; editing by Stephen Addison and Alan Crosby) \n",

      "text": "November 15 at 7:31 PM Follow @lizzadwoskin Follow @caitlindewey Follow @craigtimberg Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg took to the social network’s website over the weekend to dispute allegations that “fake news” had tilted the election for Republican Donald Trump. “More than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote, adding it was “extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election.”\nBut such reassurances have buckled under mounting criticism. On late Monday, Zuckerberg acted, joining Google in taking the most serious steps yet to crack down on purveyors of phony stories by cutting off a critical source of funding — the ads that online platforms have long funneled to creators of popular content.\n[ No, this video does not show Obama urging undocumented people to vote ]\nThe move has raised new questions about long-standing claims by Facebook, Google and other online platforms that they have little responsibility to exert editorial control over the news they deliver to billions of people, even when it includes outright lies, falsehoods or propaganda that could tilt elections.\nSuch claims became increasingly unsustainable amid reports that News Feed and Trending Topics, two core Facebook products, had promoted a number of false, misleading and fantastical political stories, such as an article saying Pope Francis had endorsed Donald Trump, which was shared by over 100,000 users. There were “vote online” memes that assured Democrats in Pennsylvania that they could cast their ballots from home and a widely shared news release claiming Hillary Clinton’s health disqualified her from serving as president.\nOver the weekend, the No. 1 Google hit for the search “final election count” was an article from a little-known site claiming that Donald Trump had won the popular vote by 700,000 votes. ( Clinton won the popular vote ).\nFacebook, Google and other Web companies have sought to walk a fine line: They don’t want to get into the practice of hiring human editors, which they believe would make them vulnerable to criticisms of partisan bias and stray from their core business of building software. Yet outsiders, as well as some within Silicon Valley, are increasingly clamoring for technology giants to take a more active role in policing the spread of deceptive information.\n“It is very difficult for Facebook to say they are not a gatekeeper when they drive such an enormous share of the attention of most news consumers across the world,” said Joshua Benton, director of the Nieman Journalism Lab at Harvard University. “They need to figure out some editorial mechanism; with their scale comes responsibility.”\n[ Facebook has repeatedly trended fake news since firing its human editors ]\nWhen Facebook detects that more people than usual are clicking on any given story, the company’s software algorithms instantaneously spread and promote that story to many other users in the network — enabling articles to “go viral” in a short period of time and making it harder to catch false news before it spreads widely.\nThe moves by Google and Facebook this week take aim at false stories but don’t impact Facebook’s News Feed or Google Search rankings, the places where fake news has actually spread. Instead, the tech giants are seeking to exert financial leverage that could prompt sites to clean up their act. Publishers make money when Google and Facebook help place ads on their websites, and they share that revenue with the technology giants. Companies found to be in violation of the policy risk losing a major source of ad dollars.\nNearly 1.2 billion people log on to Facebook every day; almost half of Americans rely on the social network as a source of news, according to the Pew Research Center. Google accounts for roughly 40 percent of traffic to news sites, according to Parse.ly, a start-up that analyzes Web traffic data for news publishers.\nGoogle spokeswoman Andrea Faville declined to detail how the company would determine the difference between false and accurate information going forward. “We use a combination of automated systems and human review,” she said\nFacebook spokesman Tom Channick emailed a statement about the new policy: “In accordance with the Audience Network policy, we do not integrate or display ads in apps or sites containing content that is illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news. While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nFacebook, Google and other sites have struggled to find automated solutions to clamp down on fake news, because there is not always a clear line between true and false news online, said a former Facebook employee who worked on the News Feed product and spoke on the condition of anonymity because he did not want to burn bridges with company.\nThe most influential sources of political misinformation on Facebook are not Macedonian fake-news sites or satirical pages but the thousands of partisan news outlets, pages and blogs that derive their traffic from News Feed, the employee said. Because those stories aren’t strictly “true” or “false,” it’s difficult to design a software algorithm that can distinguish among them.\nSome civil-liberties experts said it was dangerous to push Facebook to take on a greater editorial role. “If we wouldn’t trust the government to curate all of what we read, why would we ever think that Facebook or any one company should do it?” said Jonathan Zittrain, faculty director at the Berkman Klein Center for Internet and Society at Harvard.\nOver the past year, Facebook has struggled to strike a balance. In May, the company was accused by former employees of suppressing news stories that had a conservative bent in its trending-news section, which appears on the upper right corner of a user’s Facebook page. In an effort to quell the criticism, Zuckerberg met with conservative leaders and launched an internal investigation into bias at the social network. (The investigation, conducted by Facebook and not by an outside firm, found no evidence of anti-conservative bias.)\nThe company also published a set of editorial guidelines that detail how human editors and algorithms work together to pick what stories should appear in the Trending Topics.\nThe controversy over trending news reflects Facebook’s challenges in curating content on the medium. Facebook had quietly used a handful of journalists, hired as freelance contractors, to help the curate the Trending section. Those contractors were replaced in late August by a team of engineers who defer most editorial decisions to the Trending section’s algorithms. The social network still has an editorial team that manages trending news, and it also allows users to flag hoaxes or fake stories in its News Feed product.\nIn recent months, Zuckerberg has repeatedly emphasized that Facebook is a technology company, not a media company. Still, “there is more we can do here,” he said in his weekend blog post. He said he was proud of Facebook’s role in the election and hoped to have more to share soon. The challenge, he wrote, is that any major changes run the risk of introducing unintended side effects or biases.\n“This is an area where I believe we must proceed very carefully,” he wrote, adding, “Identifying the ‘truth’ is complicated.”\nAbby Ohlheiser contributed to this report.",

      "text": "Google Quick Draw Launched, a Web Game That Showcases the Prowess of Neural Networks Doodles have to be drawn under 20 seconds Game provides guesses in realtime Doodles have to be drawn using just the cursor \nGoogle seems to be currently obsessed with neural networks, which uses human-like systems to bring contextual understanding to machine learning. On Tuesday, the company announced the implementation of the technique for its translation tool and now its latest mini-game 'Quick Draw' showcases how this technology can be both impressive and fun at the same time. \nAlthough the name of the web game suggests that it might have something to do with the Wild West, Quick Draw asks players to draw doodles of a certain word that is shown to them. Then the players have to draw the doodle using just their mouse cursor and then company's artificial intelligence gets into action. It tries to guess the word from the doodle being drawn by the player and if your doodle is not up to the mark, you don't get any points. \nInterested readers can check out the game over here . \nEven though the function of Quick Draw seems simple at the surface, the use of neural networks ensures that the guesses, which are made in realtime, are accurate. Notably, players get just 20 seconds to draw their doodles before the game provides them with a new word. On the basis of our experience with the game, it can get really challenging and requires some thinking but never stops being fun.\nRecently, companies like Microsoft and SwiftKey have showcased how neural networks can improve artificial intelligence used in their apps by the understanding of broader context. Given that neural networks help the apps improve over time by learning, their use can substantially improve user's experience.",

      "title": "Facebook, Google Take Small Steps To Stop Spread Of Fake News",
      "text": "Facebook and Google announced Monday that they were taking steps to restrict ads from fake news outlets after facing criticism that hoax stories helped swing the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump .\nFacebook said Monday that it would ban fake news sites from using its Facebook Audience Network, which allows websites to generate revenue by including Facebook ads. Also Monday, Google said it would work to prevent websites selling fake news from using its AdSense advertising network.\nWhile both companies are taking a step in the right direction, the efforts won’t completely fix the problem of fake news stories bubbling up on the two major websites. “Facebook’s move doesn’t address the fake news that appears in users’ news feeds, the focus of criticism of the social network,” the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. It’s also not clear how the social network will identify what’s fake and what’s real.\nThese are both huge issues. During the election, Facebook hosted false news stories that included reports that actor Denzel Washington and Pope Francis had endorsed Trump. Both posts went viral on the social media website , according to NBC News.\nOn Sunday, a fake blog post suggesting that Trump had won the popular vote shot to the top of Google’s search engine for those looking up final election results. In fact, Hillary Clinton’s popular vote lead has been growing.\nI get all my news @70news what a bunch of BS pic.twitter.com/4qn41Hc9Gf\n— Tobias Lemke (@LTobis) November 14, 2016 Facebook users can still post and share fake news stories, meaning there’s still an incentive for accounts to spread hoaxes in an effort to get clicks and drive revenue. Earlier this month, Buzzfeed reported on how Macedonian teens were churning out fake, pro-Donald Trump click-bait in an effort to make money.\nThe Wall Street Journal pointed out that a Facebook spokesman “couldn’t specify the signals its software uses to identify fake news sites, or when it will also ask people to review the sites. He also couldn’t say why Facebook couldn’t use similar technology to stamp out fake news on its news feed.”\nFacebook Chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg has insisted his company did not influence last week’s presidential election . “Of all the content on Facebook, more than 99% of what people see is authentic,” he wrote in a status update posted Saturday. “The hoaxes that do exist are not limited to one partisan view, or even to politics. Overall, this makes it extremely unlikely hoaxes changed the outcome of this election in one direction or the other.”\nASSOCIATED PRESS Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg says fake news stories on the site were too few to be an influence on the presidential election. On Monday, Google said in a statement, “We clearly didn’t get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.”\nWhile Google’s move will financially restrict fake news outlets, Reuters noted that it “similarly does not address the issue of fake news or hoaxes appearing in Google search results.”\nGoogle has been “more aggressive” in weeding its search algorithms to penalize click-bait and fake news, Joe Pooley, chair of media and communication at Muhlenberg College, told The Huffington Post.\n“In some respects, this whole issue is less intense for Google,” Pooley said. “In general, Google has been better.”\nGoogle said in a statement that it would “restrict ad serving on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property.” The search engine giant did not specify how it would implement or enforce the policy, according to Reuters.\nAlso on HuffPost Newspapers React To President Trump Newspapers React To President Trump 1 of 28 Share this slide:\nNew York Times More: Facebook Google Mark Zuckerberg Fake News Adsense Suggest a correction Comments From Our Partners Presented by LendingTree Close 148 K 94.9 K 455 ",

      "text": " Google+\nElla Torres for The Boston Globe/File 2016\nAccording to the Spotlight Report, Thornton Law Firm reimbursed partner Garrett Bradley (above), a former state representative, for donations made to candidates.\nBy Andrea Estes and Viveca Novak Globe Staff | Center for Responsive Politics November 16, 2016\nFederal prosecutors in Boston have opened a grand jury investigation into potentially illegal campaign contributions from lawyers at the Thornton Law Firm, a leading donor to Democrats around the country, according to two people familiar with the probe.\nThe US attorney’s office is one of three agencies now looking into the Boston-based personal injury firm’s practice of reimbursing its partners for millions of dollars in political donations, according to the two people. The law firm has insisted that the donations were legal, but, soon after the Globe revealed the firm’s practice , politicians began returning hundreds of thousands of dollars in donations.\nAdvertisement\nFederal prosecutors as well as state and federal campaign finance regulators are investigating whether Thornton and its lawyers violated the law by paying “bonuses” to firm partners in the exact amount of their political donations and often on the same day, the people familiar with the investigations said. The firm’s attorney acknowledges the payments went on for a decade.\nRepaying donors for their contributions is generally illegal because it conceals the true source of the donations. The donors would be considered “straw donors” — or front men — and would allow the entity to vastly exceed campaign donation limits.\nGet Fast Forward Brian Kelly, a former federal prosecutor who is representing Thornton Law, would not comment on “the existence of any investigations,” but said in a statement that the firm “intends to cooperate fully if asked about its donation program and it is confident the firm complied with all applicable laws and regulations.\nView Story Spotlight report: Law firm ‘bonuses’ tied to political donations A small Boston law firm became a top funder of the national Democratic Party by paying lawyers “bonuses” for their political donations.\n“Thornton’s fund-raising program was vetted by an outside law firm 10 years ago and was overseen by an outside accountant,” wrote Kelly, a partner at Nixon Peabody. He said the reimbursements came out of each lawyer’s own equity — or ownership — in the firm.\nIf the grand jury indicts the firm and its lawyers, Thornton could be the biggest so-called “straw donor” case ever brought nationwide. Between 2010 and 2014 alone, lawyers for the firm, which specializes in asbestos cases, donated $3.4 million to candidates and the Democratic Party, especially to Senate candidates who opposed overhauling the asbestos litigation system.\nAdvertisement\n“There are serious penalties for these violations,” said Brett Kappel, a campaign finance lawyer in Washington, D.C. “Here you potentially have multiple violations of the prohibition on contributions in the name of another, each one of which would be separately charged.”\nViolations involving straw donations of $25,000 or more could bring a sentence of five years in prison for each count, Kappel said.\nTwo years ago, the former CEO of the Fiesta Bowl, John Junker, and four others pleaded guilty to a straw donor scheme in which employees were reimbursed more than $45,000 for political contributions they were encouraged to make. Junker served four months in federal prison and four months in a halfway house.\nThe largest civil penalties ever levied by the FEC for straw donations came in the late 1990s when Audiovox Corp. and a number of individuals were fined $849,000 for a series of contributions as small as a few hundred dollars. However, companies have sometimes paid millions in penalties to settle criminal charges.\nThe reported grand jury investigation comes just two weeks after the Globe and the Center for Responsive Politics documented that three partners at the firm — founder Michael Thornton, former House assistant majority leader Garrett Bradley, and David Strouss — received about $1.4 million in bonuses to offset their campaign contributions over a five-year period. In at least 30 cases, Thornton was also reimbursed for donations made by his wife, Amy, based on a review of internal payroll records obtained by the Globe and the Center.\nThe firm started offering bonuses to offset partners’ political donations at a time when the partners were being asked to donate more and more money, causing some grumbling. The reimbursement policy was so complicated that some lawyers at the firm said they didn’t understand it, but they were still happy to get their money back.\nSince the Globe story ran, at least 19 candidates and one campaign committee announced that they have returned more than $900,000 to lawyers at the firm, or gave the money to the US Treasury, or a charity. They include Hillary Clinton, Senator Edward Markey, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Representative Joseph Kennedy III, and Boston Mayor Martin J. Walsh.\nAttorney General Maura Healey, who called for investigations of the firm, also returned donations she received from Thornton lawyers.\nOne of the biggest recipients of Thornton’s largesse, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said on Tuesday night that it, too, was giving up contributions from partners at the firm. Previously, committee officials had indicated they were awaiting a review of the donations by its attorneys, but a person at the committee said the organization has sent $267,000 to Treasury. However, records show that contributions from Thornton employees to the committee over the last 10 years total $1.5 million.\nCampaign finance specialists say that Thornton attorneys could face charges for violating a variety of state and federal laws, including the Federal Election Campaign Act’s prohibitions on “contributions in the name of another.” Thornton lawyers could also face allegations that they illegally caused candidates receiving their money to file false campaign finance reports by indicating that the lawyers were the sources of the funds, when it was actually the firm.\nIn addition, the specialists said, Thornton lawyers who participated in the contribution reimbursement system could be charged with conspiracy.\nA campaign finance watchdog group filed a complaint against Thornton with the Federal Election Commission on Nov. 2, a step that automatically triggers an FEC review. However, prosecutors could ask the FEC to hold off on any investigation, and the agency could pick it up again after the criminal case is over and then seek to impose civil penalties, according to Dan Petalas, a former acting general counsel of the FEC who is now in private practice in Washington.\nThe Mass. Office of Campaign and Political Finance is also looking into whether the law firm was the “true source” of the more than $260,000 in donations to state and local politicians lawyers at Thornton Law firm have made, according to two people briefed on the matter. If the regulators find wrongdoing, they can impose penalties, called civil forfeitures, or refer the matter to the state attorney general for possible criminal prosecution.\nThis case has the potential to be the largest straw donor investigation in state history.\nThe biggest civil forfeiture in recent years was $185,000 paid last month by Canton businessman Vincent Barletta, who provided $35,500 to employees to make political contributions. In 2015, the owners of Capitol Waste of East Boston, a trash company with contracts with Boston and other communities, agreed to pay $120,000 to the state and four cities after the state agency found the owners gave employees $38,000 to donate to political candidates.\nMilton Valencia of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nCheryl Senter for The Boston Globe/File 2015\nRepresentative Seth Moulton, a Salem congressman, is questioning the Democratic Party’s direction after the election.\nBy Victoria McGrane and Astead W. Herndon Globe Staff November 15, 2016\nWASHINGTON — House Democrats staged a mini-revolt Tuesday, forcing a delay in leadership elections so the caucus can have time to digest Donald Trump’s shocking victory and formulate a plan to respond to the new Republican-controlled world that will dawn in January.\nSeth Moulton, a Salem Democrat, helped organize the push to postpone the elections to Nov. 30, gathering more than 30 signatures for a letter to House minority leader Nancy Pelosi and convening a dinner at Acqua Al 2, an Italian restaurant on Capitol Hill, with 20 other mostly younger House Democrats to strategize about the caucus.\nAdvertisement\nThe uprising hints at the unrest and even anger boiling among rank-and-file Democrats in the wake of Trump’s upset, but it remains uncertain whether Pelosi’s tenure is actually threatened.\nThe day after last week’s election, House Democratic leaders said they were moving the leadership election up nearly two weeks. That accelerated schedule did not sit well with many of their members.\nGet Political Happy Hour “The American people sent a very clear message that the status quo in the Democratic Party is unacceptable and rushing leadership elections this week only reinforces the status quo,” Moulton said in an interview with the Globe. “It doesn’t give us the opportunity to have the conversation we need to have about how to move our party forward after a horrific election.”\n“As a caucus, we need to rethink our message and change some of our messengers,” said Richard Neal of Springfield, who backed the delay. He said in an interview, though, that it’s too soon to say if any credible challengers to Pelosi or others caucus leaders will emerge.\n“For now there’s a chance to do a reset in terms of the conversation. Return our emphasis to economic growth, which should have been the conversation piece for the last 10 years,” said Neal.\nAdvertisement\nThere are rumblings among some caucus members that it’s time for the old guard — many of them in their 70s — to move aside for fresher faces. Still, no one has publicly thrown their hat in the ring to challenge Pelosi, a fund-raising powerhouse who enjoys strong support in the caucus. Rumors are mounting that Ohio Representative Tim Ryan might take a shot, but seasoned political analysts doubt he can muster enough support to topple Pelosi. Another possibility is Pelosi remains in the top spot but embraces new blood further down the leadership ranks.\nIf nothing else, some insiders say, Tuesday’s revolt will serve as a wake-up call for Pelosi and her team.\nMoulton, a Marine captain who served four tours in Iraq, demurred when asked if current leadership needs to go. “We need a plan and we need the right leaders to execute that plan,” he said. “I’m going to vote for the person who can articulate the strongest plan.”\nCongressman Jim McGovern, who represents Worcester and the Pioneer Valley, said he was squarely backing current Pelosi’s bid for reelection, regardless of the delay.\n“I do not believe that [the vote delay] is meant as an attempt to undermine leader Pelosi,” McGovern said. “I think this is an attempt by a lot of people to say wait a minute, let’s take a breather, and let’s talk about strategy in the future.”\nJoseph Kennedy III said the delay was a chance for lawmakers to “take stock’’ in the party.\n“Leader Pelosi has done an extraordinary job leading our caucus every since I’ve been here and well before,” said Kennedy, of Newton. “I expect she will continue leading the caucus.”\nThe caucus meeting Tuesday morning was described as extremely tense by several people in the room. At the start, caucus leadership sought to allow lawmakers to speak for two minutes. Representative Michael Capuano of Somerville piped up that people needed more time to speak, prompting applause, according to two people in the room.\nMoulton said he had come to the meeting with a motion prepared to formally ask for a vote on delaying the leadership election. After numerous colleagues spoke out in support of delay, he handed the text he had drafted to Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, who then made the motion, Moulton said. Whether the motion would be ruled in order or not was hotly debated until Pelosi and her team relented and agreed to reschedule the election.\nThe unrest points to a deep frustration among members of the House Democratic caucus over how little they have to show for years of legislative knife-fights and endless fund-raising.\n“When I came to Congress we were a national party,” said Neal, ticking through the devastating math of recent years. Although Democrats picked up a handful of seats last week, in the last four election cycles they have still down about 60 slots in the House, 14 seats in the Senate, and more than 830 legislative seats across the country, he noted. One-third of the House Democratic caucus is lawmakers from bright-blue Massachusetts, New York, and California.\nNeal said that last week’s election results, in which Trump performed well with union households, underscored his belief that the Democratic Party needs to return to emphasizing ways to boost economic growth, rather than focusing so much on cultural differences with Republicans.\n“When does the economic message begin to take center stage in the party that I signed up for?” he asked, describing his support for the delay.\nVictoria McGrane can be reached at victoria.mcgrane@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nCraig F. Walker/Globe Staff/File\nMarijuana growing in a home in Rhode Island for medical use.\nBy Shirley Leung Globe Columnist November 16, 2016\nCongratulations Massachusetts, we just passed one of the worst pot bills in the country.\nNow what?\nAdvertisement\nPlenty.\nOur Beacon Hill leaders should do what they didn’t do in the first place, which is steer this runaway train down the right track. The Yes on 4 campaign successfully tapped into voter sentiment on legalizing recreational marijuana, and the ballot measure passed comfortably with about 54 percent in support. Voters in three other states — Maine, California, and Nevada — also legalized pot by ballot initiative last week.\nGet Business Headlines Here’s the problem, which my colleague Joan Vennochi also warned about : This is a law written by the marijuana industry, and it’s got their best interests, not ours, in mind.\nView Story Towns may try to block marijuana shops Some cities and towns are exploring ways to limit or even snuff out marijuana shops in their communities.\n‘Grow-your-own’ shops see budding demand\nLawmakers now have the ability to go back and make amendments without undoing the will of the people. Proponents will tell you the Legislature had its shot to craft marijuana legislation and now it’s up to a new Cannabis Control Commission to come up with regulations.\nJim Borghesani, the spokesman for the Yes on 4 campaign, sums up the group’s position this way: “The Legislature would be wise to wait and see what legislative actions are identified by and requested by the CCC in due course of their deliberations rather than leaping to action before the CCC is even appointed, much less started on their tasks.”\nAdvertisement\nBut why wait? This law, says Kevin Hill, a McLean Hospital doctor and author of “Marijuana: The Unbiased Truth about the World’s Most Popular Weed,” should be treated like a living document.\n“We should expect to have excellent marijuana policy,” said Dr. Hill, who specializes in substance abuse issues. “We have the brainpower in the Commonwealth to give people what they want while limiting risk.”\nSo here are five ways to fix the law we just passed:\n1. Local control — opt in In Colorado, the first state in the country to legalize marijuana, individual communities could vote on whether to allow retail marijuana businesses in their backyard. Seventy percent of towns voted to ban weed shops, while 30 percent, including the city of Denver, opted in.\nThe Massachusetts law automatically allows pot shops, which are expected to start opening in 2018, in every town. Communities must now vote by referendum to keep marijuana shops out, and some mayors are already gearing up to do that.\nIt’s local control, but not the kind we are used to. Even our medical marijuana law was more empowering, requiring a letter of support or of non-opposition from a town leader or governing body.\nThe Legislature should rewrite the recreational marijuana law to mirror Colorado’s opt-in concept. It’s also what we do with casinos in Massachusetts and allow each community to vote on whether to legalize gambling in their backyard. Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, who campaigned against Question 4, worries the pot law as written doesn’t do enough to protect neighborhoods.\n“My concern is that people in Boston voted to support it by a pretty big margin,” Walsh told me, but “now when it comes to siting these pot shops, they are not going to want it in their neighborhood.”\n2. Ban home-grown plants The Massachusetts law allows each individual to grow up to six marijuana plants at home for personal use. Colorado also allows for home growing, but Washington state, which also legalized marijuana, does not.\nMassachusetts Treasurer Deb Goldberg, whose office will regulate marijuana , is urging lawmakers to get rid of the home-grow provision because it could hurt the retail market and it’s difficult to enforce.\nHere’s another reason: organized crime. In a recent “60 Minutes” segment on the impact of legalized marijuana in Colorado, the sheriff of Pueblo County detailed how criminals are moving into the state and setting up sophisticated operations known as “illegal homegrows.”\nIn the last six months, law enforcement in Pueblo recorded 36 busts, up from one or two a year prior to marijuana legalization. The groups are taking advantage of the home-grow rule and then selling the marijuana illegally out of state.\n“No this is not a Mom and Pop — ‘let’s grow a little weed.’ This is organized crime,” Sheriff Kirk Taylor told the show. “Who’s behind the illegal grows? Different groups of folks. Cuban nationals from Florida. We’ve busted Russians from New York. The pattern that they’ve shown here in the last six months is they’ll come in and buy a home or rent a home or a series of homes. And they’ll set up grows in those homes whether it be in the garages, in the out-buildings, very sophisticated.”\n3. Double the tax rate Proponents of Question 4 kept the tax on marijuana on the low side — up to 12 percent — to discourage the black market. Sales are subject to an excise tax of 3.75 percent, plus the general sales tax of 6.25 percent. Cities and towns can apply an additional sales tax of 2 percent.\nBut our rate seems out of whack with Colorado and Washington, where effective tax rates range from 25 percent to 44 percent.\nI’ve called for a higher tax rate to ensure that we can cover the cost of regulating this new industry — from inspectors to additional law enforcement.\nState Senator Jason Lewis, who chaired the Special Senate Committee on Marijuana, has described the ballot measure as a “bad deal for taxpayers” and doesn’t think as written the tax revenues will cover what could be tens of millions of dollars in expenses to regulate weed.\nDr. Hill, the McLean doctor who is an expert on marijuana policy , believes an effective rate of 25 percent feels right. “That makes sense,” said Hill. “You are in the range of other states.”\nBorghesani, of the Yes on 4 campaign, wants to leave the issue of the higher tax rate to the Cannabis Control Commission. “If the regulators say we think the tax rate has to go up, it would be fine with us,” he said.\n4. Restructure the commission One of the marijuana industry’s mantras has been to regulate marijuana like alcohol. That’s why the new law puts the state treasurer, who oversees the Alcoholic Beverages Control Commission, in charge of the new three-member Cannabis Control Commission. The treasurer make all three appointments.\nThe better model is the Gaming Commission. To reduce the potential for undue influence on one office, the Legislature should create a commission with one appointment each from the treasurer, the governor, and the attorney general.\nLawmakers should also consider increasing the size of the commission to five members to reflect the complex nature of managing marijuana. You’ll likely need to draw expertise from the following fields: marijuana industry, public health, law enforcement, agriculture, and policy.\n5. Invest in data and set up a public health trust fund Even though Colorado is two years into legalizing recreational marijuana, it still feels like one big experiment . Some data points show no impact on youth marijuana usage; others show a spike. Initially, state officials found that marijuana-related traffic incidents declined after legalization, but now there’s an uptick.\nMassachusetts lawmakers should invest in collecting baseline data to fully understand the social, economic, public health, and public safety impacts of marijuana legalization. The data can be used to help mitigate problems such as addiction and drug driving.\nI once again point to our gaming statute, which set up a public health trust funded by casino tax revenue. When all the casinos are open, about $15 million to $20 million a year will be set aside to fund research and remediation to offset the negative impact of legalized gambling. A similar trust fund should be set up for marijuana.\nRelated Towns may try to block marijuana shops ‘Grow-your-own’ shops say there’s a budding demand for pot information\nShirley Leung is a Globe columnist.

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 Advertisement\nTrump, who clashed with leading Republicans throughout his campaign, faced growing tumult in his national security transition team on Tuesday as key members of his own party appeared to question his views and personnel choices.\nFormer congressman Mike Rogers, Republican of Michigan, a respected voice on national security thought to be a leading candidate to run the CIA, was among those pushed out of the team over the past two days, two individuals with direct knowledge said, in a series of moves that have added to the anxiety across the upper ranks of US intelligence agencies.\nMaterial from the Washington Post wire service was used in this report.",

      "text": " Google+\nBrennan Linsley/Associated Press\nColorado began retail marijuana sales on Jan. 1, 2014. The marijuana industry in Massachusetts will face many of the same challenges.\nBy Dan Adams and Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 16, 2016\n“Big Pot” is not coming to Massachusetts.\nThough voters approved recreational marijuana last week, don’t expect a land rush to Massachusetts by out-of-state corporate profiteers who can quickly throw up a weed store on every corner.\nAdvertisement\nInstead, cannabis companies anticipate the retail market for legal marijuana here will be slow to develop and fragmented among numerous small firms, most of them homegrown startups or locally-owned partnerships with boutique pot companies from states such as Colorado.\n“There isn’t some megalithic industry that exists today,” said Kris Krane, the Boston-based president of marijuana investment and consulting firm 4Front Ventures. “The notion that there are these gigantic, big-money players running in to take this whole thing over is just a fiction. There’s no Philip Morris, no Anheuser-Busch, no cannabis division at Bank of America. Even the most successful company is still barely in the growth stage.”\nGet Business Headlines The absence of such conglomerates is due in large part to marijuana’s status as an illegal drug under federal law, which makes it very difficult for a single company to operate in multiple states and enjoy the economies of scale available to more conventional retailers. Colorado pot retailers that wanted to move into Massachusetts, for example, would essentially have to start from scratch here, building new growing and processing centers or partnering with a local cultivator.\nAnd despite pot’s much-touted upside — investment and research firm Arcview Group forecasts a $1.1 billion marijuana market in Massachusetts by 2020 — capital can be surprisingly hard to come by, again thanks to the federal prohibition, which scares off institutional investors.\nAs a result, experts predicted most marijuana storefronts — the most visible public sign of the drug’s legality — will be run by small companies with local ties and funding from boutique investment firms or even friends and family. Existing medical marijuana facilities will also likely play a role. Some retailers may partner with experienced operators from Colorado or Oregon, but a Walmart of Weed? There’s no such thing.\nAdvertisement\n“Unless you’re extremely well-capitalized and have a large workforce and are willing to re-create your business, jumping to a new state is extremely challenging,” Krane said.\nMassachusetts was one of four states to legalize marijuana last week, bringing the total nationwide to eight. That means companies that do have national ambitions have a pick of where to open next.\nThe biggest companies in the US pot business so far are not retailers — Colorado’s largest chain, Native Roots, has just 14 stores — but rather product companies that license their brands and recipes to dispensaries.\nOne of the largest such firms, Denver-based Organa Brands , has licensed its “O.penVAPE” brand of liquid marijuana concentrates to a medical dispensary in Salem. Organa makes concentrates for medical and recreational uses that are consumed through a vaporizer.\nOrgana Brands is planning an advertising push in advance of entering the Massachusetts recreational market, though president Chris Driessen said he would keep the tone of his marketing low key, to match the state’s somewhat more reserved attitude about marijuana.\n“I’m not going to have billboards blasting cannabis things all over the place,” he said. “We’re not the party crowd from Colorado trying to shove it down your throat.”\nJohn Blanding/Globe Staff/File\nThe immediate factor that will keep the recreational marijuana business from exploding overnight is Question 4 itself. Shops can’t open until January 2018 at the earliest.\nBut Organa and other cannabis companies are bracing for complications as regulators and state legislators consider changes to the ballot measure that could make any business decisions they make now moot. Among the proposals in play: raising marijuana taxes to offset regulatory costs, and extending the January 2018 timeline for the first pot shops to open.\n‘You’ve got to be flexible and patient. It’s not for the faint of heart’\nTim Keogh, Colorado marijuana grower Businesses also expect some municipalities will try to ban or limit marijuana activity ; in Colorado, just 75 of 321 local jurisdictions allow both medical and recreational pot shops .\nThose in the business said the tight government control and regulatory uncertainty recalls the troubled and prolonged roll-out of the state’s medical marijuana program .\n“It’s dynamic. You’ve got to be flexible and patient. It’s not for the faint of heart,” said Tim Keogh, whose Colorado company is raising money for a large marijuana greenhouse and processing center in Freetown.\nThe possibility of higher taxes is especially concerning for marijuana firms. They fear high rates will drive users back to the black market. Companies are also anxious about President-elect Donald Trump, who has sent mixed signals about whether he’ll continue the Obama administration’s hands-off approach to federal oversight.\nBut the most immediate factor that will keep the recreational marijuana business from exploding overnight is the language of Question 4 itself. Under the new law, residents can consume and grow their own marijuana beginning Dec. 15, but shops can’t open until January 2018 at the earliest.\nMoreover, the law gives existing medical marijuana licensees, or a company they designate, the first shot at recreational licenses for potentially as long as one year before other firms can apply.\nHowever, some medical dispensaries aren’t sure they even want to sell to the recreational market, given the uncertainty surrounding the law’s final form.\nOne medical dispensary, New England Treatment Access, has told patients it will seek a recreational license. But another, Beacon Compassion Center, which is opening a medical dispensary in Framingham, might not apply for a recreational license, even though it donated $5,000 to the legalization campaign, said director Steve Angelo.\nColumbia Care, a national medical marijuana company operating two dispensaries in Massachusetts under the Patriot Care brand, has a more complex outlook. It is only interested the medical side of the business, yet it is considering seeking recreational licenses in order to serve patients who are wary of registering with the state as medical marijuana users.\n“If someone comes to us and they want additional privacy, I don’t want to be in a position where we can’t help them,” said Columbia Care chief executive Nicholas Vita.\nDespite the long road ahead, cannabis companies are hopeful they’ll eventually be rewarded in Massachusetts.\nDriessen envisions the state becoming a major center of so-called “canna-tourism” that draws people from all around the populous Northeast region, as it and Maine are the only East Coast states to have legalized pot.\n“We came to the Massachusetts medical market knowing that, one day, recreational was going to come, even if the return was going to be a bit slower,” he said. “We’re always skating where the puck is going, not where it’s at.”\nDan Adams can be reached at daniel.adams@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nAl Drago/The New York Times\nRudy Giuliani during the Wall Street Journal’s CEO Council in Washington on Monday.\nBy Mark Landler, Eric Lipton and Jo Becker New York Times November 16, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Rudolph W. Giuliani, facing a flood of questions about whether his business dealings should disqualify him from being named President-elect Donald Trump’s secretary of state, on Tuesday defended his lucrative 15 years in the private sector as a credential for the job.\n“I have friends all over the world,” Giuliani, the former New York mayor, said in an interview. “This is not a new thing for me. When you become the mayor, you become interested in foreign policy. When I left, my major work was legal and security around the world.”\nAdvertisement\nAs secretary of state, Giuliani, a loyal, often ferocious backer of Trump’s candidacy, would make fighting Islamist terrorism the centerpiece of the incoming administration’s foreign policy. He vaulted to national prominence because of his leadership after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, and he still views foreign policy through the prism of that day.\nBut Giuliani’s business ties are a major red flag. He built a lucrative consulting and speechmaking career after leaving City Hall. His firm, Giuliani Partners, has had contracts with the government of Qatar and the Canadian company that is building the Keystone XL pipeline, and Giuliani has given paid speeches to a shadowy Iranian opposition group that until 2012 was on the State Department’s list of foreign terrorist organizations.\nGet Political Happy Hour In one year — 2006 — Giuliani reported in a financial disclosure report that he had made 124 speeches, for as much as $200,000 each, and had earned a total of $11.4 million. He often made extravagant demands in return for agreeing to make a speech, including that the private plane that flew him to the engagement be of a certain size.\nDuring the presidential campaign, Trump repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton for her speeches to Goldman Sachs, as well as for contributions Qatar made to the Clinton Foundation, which he claimed betrayed her commitment to women’s and gay rights because of Qatar’s poor record on both.\nThis week, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, questioned Giuliani’s fitness for the job, pointing to his list of paid speeches, his work for foreign governments and his support for the Iraq War. Trump has long claimed erroneously that he opposed the war.\nAdvertisement\n“It is worrisome, some of the ties to foreign governments, because that was a big complaint about many of us with Hillary Clinton and her ties and the money she received from foreign governments,” Paul told CNN on Tuesday.\nGiuliani defended his firm’s work for Qatar — which he said included training the Qatari police and analyzing the security of a desalinization plant — because he said it was done under the previous emir, Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, who abdicated in 2013. Giuliani said he consulted the State Department about the contracts and was told that Khalifa was friendly toward the United States.\nGiuliani said he was one of dozens of prominent Americans who worked for the Iranian opposition group known as the Mujahedeen Khalq, or the MEK — drawing payments at the same time it was on a State Department list designating it a terrorist organization. He sought to persuade the State Department to revoke its terrorist listing, which the Americans did in September 2012.\n“My ties to them are very open,” Giuliani said. “We worked very hard to get them delisted — by Hillary Clinton, by the way.” Another Giuliani client, the energy company TransCanada, applied to build the Keystone XL pipeline in the United States, and was rejected last year by President Barack Obama after a recommendation by Secretary of State John Kerry. If it decided to apply again for permission and Giuliani ends up at the State Department, the application would land on his desk.\nGiuliani did not address that issue directly in the interview, saying only that his firm had offered security advice to TransCanada, when it had a partnership to build a natural-gas facility on Long Island Sound. The proposal was turned down.\n“I’ve done no work on the pipeline,” he said.\nHis other clients have included a long list of prominent U.S. corporations, including Bear Stearns, Uber and CB Richard Ellis, the real estate giant. Under contract with Purdue Pharma, the maker of the often-abused painkiller OxyContin, Giuliani used his clout with the Justice Department to press the federal authorities to offer a less onerous punishment to the company after allegations that security problems at its warehouses might have contributed to black market sales.\nBut it is the lesser-known names that may draw the most scrutiny.\nTriGlobal Strategic Ventures, a company that aims to “assist Western clients in furthering their business interests in the emerging economies of the former Soviet Union,” according to its website, is among the more obscure clients.\nRecords show Giuliani has had ties dating to at least 2004 to TriGlobal, a company that has provided image consulting to Russian oligarchs and clients with deep Kremlin ties, including Transneft, Russia’s state-owned oil pipeline giant, which is currently the target of Western sanctions imposed after President Vladimir Putin annexed Crimea and began meddling in Ukraine.\nTriGlobal’s advisory board includes Ara Abramyan, listed on the company’s website as a “very close Advisor to the Russian Government’s inner circle including the President and the Prime Minister.” The company’s founding partners are Andrey Drobyshev, who claims to have strong relations with regional and municipal governments in Russia, and Vitaly Pruss, whose website profile says that he has focused on “international image development and PR for Russian & Ukrainian companies” and that from 2008 to 2011, he worked “closely with Giuliani Partners LLC.”\nJeffrey Berman, one of TriGlobal’s managing partners, is also vice president of Berman Enterprises, a family-run company that worked with Giuliani Partners in 2008 to form a commercial and residential real estate investment vehicle called the Berman Opportunity Fund. Its purpose was to target foreign investors looking to take advantage of the weak dollar through real estate investments in New York and Washington. Few public details are available about Giuliani’s role in the real estate venture, and Berman did not return a call for comment. But some of Giuliani’s work for TriGlobal, which has offices in Moscow and Kiev, Ukraine, is featured on the company’s website.\nIn 2004, for instance, the company arranged to have Giuliani come to Moscow to meet with the foreign minister, Sergey V. Lavrov, as well as other prominent Russian politicians and business executives. That year, Giuliani visited Magnitogorsk, Russia, “for a series of meetings with Viktor Rashnikov,” a Russian billionaire who is the chairman of the Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works.\nWhile Trump has vowed to bring back jobs in the U.S. steel industry, Russia has complained about American tariffs on steel that hurt companies like Rashnikov’s. TriGlobal also arranged for Giuliani to meet with executives from the Russian steel company in the next year in New York, where they dined at the St. Regis hotel at an event attended by Bill Clinton.\nIn 2015, also at the company’s behest, Giuliani agreed to advise the mayor of Kiev, Vitali Klitschko, who has called for more Western support of the Ukrainian government’s efforts to combat Russian separatists.\nJames A. Thurber, the director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said Giuliani’s consulting work over the last 15 years should disqualify him from taking the secretary of state job.\n“It creates an immediate conflict of interest with leaders of nations that he has worked with,” Thurber said. “People asked about Hillary Clinton and donations to Clinton Foundation. It is very different than being paid directly by foreign countries to represent them.”\nGiuliani, in the Tuesday interview, acknowledged that he did not view the world exactly as Trump does. He said he regarded Putin, whom Trump has praised, as “a guy who is pushing us very hard,” adding: “I think he needs to be pushed back. I wouldn’t want to put Russia in the category of enemy — yet.”\n“Donald Trump is not going to pick anyone who agrees with him 100 percent,” Giuliani said.\nHe said, however, that he could not think of any disagreements with Trump’s closest foreign policy adviser, Lt. Gen. Michael T. Flynn, who shares Giuliani’s belief that Islamist militancy poses an existential threat. If Flynn becomes Trump’s national security adviser, the Trump administration would almost certainly revive George W. Bush’s global war on terrorism.\n“In my case, it might have some extra emotion because of September 11,” Giuliani said. In one respect, experts said, Trump would be different from Bush. While Bush thought a lack of freedom caused jihadi terrorism to spread, Trump and Giuliani believe the fault lies in Islam itself.\n“It is a sea change, and it really changes the terms of the discussion about what to do about it,” said William McCants, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and the author of “The ISIS Apocalypse.”",

      "text": " Google+\nSuzanne Kreiter/Globe Staff/File\nBy Matt Rocheleau and Travis Andersen Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nWater tests conducted at about 300 public school buildings in Massachusetts this year show that more than half had at least one sample with lead levels above regulatory limits, state officials announced on Tuesday.\nSteps are being taken to address the problems found in the 164 school buildings by flushing pipes, shutting off drinking fountains or taps, and making long-term plumbing repairs, officials said.\nAdvertisement\n“When schools identify problem fixtures, they are quickly taking steps to fix the problem and providing timely updates to their students, families, staff and community,” Martin Suuberg, commissioner of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection, said in a statement.\nThe tests, part of an ongoing water analysis in public school buildings, were conducted primarily on drinking water and water used in the preparation of food. A small number of samples may have been taken from taps used for hand washing, officials said.\nGet Fast Forward The state has also been testing copper levels in school water. The bulk of the approximately 300 buildings tested had elevated levels of either copper or lead. Just 73 did not have elevated levels of either.\nA clean-water advocate said she is concerned about high lead levels in school buildings, but said she is confident school districts are taking appropriate steps to keep children safe.\n“By the time parents are hearing of these results, the schools have eliminated the exposure,” said Becky Smith, the Massachusetts campaign director for Clean Water Action, a nonprofit advocacy group. “Parents should feel the water is safe to drink.”\nAdvertisement\nThe water sampling was done through a $2 million program the state launched this past spring in the wake of concerns generated by the crisis in Flint, Mich., where high lead levels contaminated the city’s drinking water.\nSome testing of Massachusetts schools began in the late spring and over the summer, and the program intensified around the start of the school year, said Ed Coletta, a spokesman for MassDEP, which is overseeing the testing.\nOn Tuesday, state officials announced that an additional $750,000 from the Massachusetts Clean Water Trust is being made available to continue testing water in public schools. The money is in addition to $2 million in funding from the trust already approved in spring.\nGovernor Charlie Baker, in a statement, said that “ensuring every water tap and fountain is properly tested expeditiously is an important priority for our administration, the more than 900 schools, and the thousands of students attending them.”\nTom Scott, executive director of the Massachusetts Association of School Superintendents, said in an e-mail that members are taking the water issue seriously.\n“They completely understand that a paramount responsibility is the safety and well being of our students,” Scott wrote, adding that “most districts have already provided transparency with the public and taking action steps to shut down access to water sources which students have access.”\nIn Lawrence and Quincy, where school buildings showed high lead levels, steps already are underway to address the issue, school officials said.\nChristopher Markuns, a spokesman for Lawrence schools, said elevated lead levels were found in about 80 of more than 1,000 samples taken districtwide. The state found elevated levels of lead or copper at 12 schools in Lawrence.\n“None of these were in use as drinking water this year, and remediation plans or shut-offs are in place,” Markuns said in an e-mail.\nAfter samplings in the fall turned up elevated levels, the district flushed water systems at the schools, took fixtures off-line, and posted “hand washing only” signs at some faucets and provided bottled water at some locations, state officials said.\nQuincy School Superintendent Richard DeCristofaro said staff, students, and families at the affected schools were notified of the test results earlier this month, and that officials are taking safety measures in response to the findings.\nThose measures include shutting off all affected water fountains and sinks until they can be repaired and providing water coolers in the affected buildings to ensure students and staff have access to safe drinking water.\nSchool officials began looking into the matter last summer in collaboration with the state, and informed parents in August that Quincy would be participating in the testing.\nThe state environmental department has posted statewide results of the water sampling in a spreadsheet on its website and says it plans to update that data on a weekly basis.\nThat data appeared to be a portion of all the testing that has been done at Massachusetts schools so far and did not include any results for Boston, where elevated lead levels were recently discovered in several school buildings .\nData posted as of Tuesday evening showed results for 6,396 samples for lead testing.\nOut of that total, 671 samples, or about 10 percent, exceeded the state limit for lead in school drinking water of 15 parts per billion.\nSome were just barely over that limit, but other readings came back much higher.\nOfficials said they expect to complete water sampling and technical assistance for all 930 public school buildings in the program by January.\nMatt Rocheleau can be reached at matthew.rocheleau@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Thomas Farragher Globe Columnist November 15, 2016\nTom Farragher/Globe Staff\nSue Miner, co-owner of Bob&apos;s Turkey Farm in Lancaster, with some of the farm’s birds.\nLANCASTER — Little turkeys like it hot. When they first hatch, they have to be kept at 100 degrees or so and that requires something called a brooder — a fowl version of a heat lamp. Nice and cozy.\n“It’s for the babies to stay under if they need to keep warm,’’ Sue Miner explained.\nAdvertisement\nAnd that’s where thousands of them were on the last day of June at the height of the hatching season for Bob’s Turkey Farm, the place Miner’s father started here in 1954 with just 125 turkeys. It’s a rambling and popular enterprise Miner now runs with her brother, Richard Van Hoof.\nWhile tiny turkeys jostled for position under those lamps amid wood shavings in an open-air barn, Miner was grilling supper nearby in the home she owns on the edge of the farm property. It was just before 6 p.m.\nGet Fast Forward “I smelled something, and then this car comes racing down the driveway at 50 miles an hour, yelling, ‘ You’ve got a barn on fire !’ ” Miner recalled. “We had one of our biggest hatches that morning — 2,600 of them. It was awful to know they were all killed. But there was no saving that barn.’’\nNo. It was gone. The barn. Expensive equipment. Some 7,000 young turkeys headed for Thanksgiving tables throughout Central Massachusetts. And, seemingly, a way of life that founder Bob Van Hoof — now 89 and retired — built for himself after he got out of the Navy.\nVan Hoof worked hard and taught his seven children about life on a turkey farm: Turkeys lay eggs every other day. Hens are none too happy when you take their eggs away. About a month after an egg is laid, the baby bird emerges. After 24 weeks or so, those chicks have grown into 20-pound turkeys ready to be processed. Then someone is carving it on their dining-room table.\nAdvertisement\nAnd across the years, Sue Miner has seen it all. As a little girl, she sat in her dad’s truck as he delivered turkeys and, after the Thanksgiving rush, plowed driveways with him. When she was old enough to work, she was on the eviscerating line, or in the kitchen, or packaging retail pies.\nThere’s turkey soup, turkey kielbasa, turkey tenderloins, turkey meatloaf, turkey lasagna, turkey cutlets, turkey quiche.\n“We liked the money, and my dad always paid us,’’ she told me this week at her office here. “I had enough money to buy a car by the time I was 16.’’ It was a red Volkswagen bug. And she’d earned it. Turns out raising turkeys isn’t easy. The financial margins aren’t wide. And June’s fire was a gut punch.\nWhen I talked to them on Monday, Miner and her brother Richard Van Hoof exchanged sad glances, recalling the day their barn burned down.\n“I said, ‘My God, what are we going to do?’ ” Miner told me. “He’s 62. I’m 59. Do we still want to do this? It’s hard work. It’s seven days a week. My brother has been doing this full time since he was 18 years old.’’\nAnd then Richard Van Hoof echoed something his father told the Globe 33 years ago. “There’s a lot of ‘back’ work in what I do,’’ Bob Van Hoof said then. “And because I’ve gotten older, I’ve gotten to the point where I’d rather not do it too much longer.’’\nLike father, like son. “Lot of work,’’ Richard agreed. “The days seem to get longer and life is getting shorter. You almost say to yourself: ‘Just quit. The hell with it.’ ”\nBut then something wonderful happened. Longtime customers showed up with ice cream and water and Gatorade. Neighbors opened an account at a local bank. Thousands of dollars poured in. Contractors donated rebuilding equipment. Town officials bent over backward. Chicks born after the fire became a lifeline.\nEarly next week, on the road outside Bob’s Turkey Farm, there will be a familiar sight. Two cops will direct heavy traffic. And the place will overflow with succulent turkeys — and with warm thanks from both sides of the counter.\nThomas Farragher is a Globe columnist. He can reached at thomas.farragher@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nManuel Balce Ceneta/Associated Press/File 2014\nMike Rogers, a former representative from Michigan, had been thought to be a leading candidate to head the CIA.\nBy Julie Hirschfeld Davis and Mark Mazzetti New York Times November 16, 2016\nWASHINGTON — President-elect Donald Trump’s transition was in disarray on Tuesday, marked by firings, infighting, and revelations that US allies were blindly dialing in to Trump Tower to try to reach the soon-to-be-leader of the free world.\nOne week after Trump scored an upset victory that took him by surprise, his team was improvising the most basic traditions of assuming power. That included working without official State Department briefing materials in his first conversations with foreign leaders.\nAdvertisement\nTwo officials who had been handling national security for the transition, former representative Mike Rogers of Michigan and Matthew Freedman, a lobbyist who consults with corporations and foreign governments, were fired. Both were part of what officials described as a purge orchestrated by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and close adviser.\nThe dismissals followed the firing on Friday of Governor Chris Christie of New Jersey, who was replaced as chief of the transition by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. Kushner, a transition official said, was systematically dismissing people like Rogers and Freedman who had ties with Christie. As a federal prosecutor, Christie had sent Kushner’s father to jail.\nGet Political Happy Hour US allies were in the meantime scrambling to figure out how and when to contact Trump. At times they have been patched through to him in his luxury office tower with little warning, according to a Western diplomat who spoke on the condition of anonymity to detail private conversations.\nView Story Trump breaks protocol by going out for dinner without press The Trump transition team had previously informed reporters at Trump Tower that there would be no movement by the president-elect.\nDonald Trump’s administraton: the key players John McCain calls any Russia reset ‘unacceptable’ Ted Cruz meets with Donald Trump in New York\nPresident Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi of Egypt was the first to reach Trump for such a call last Wednesday, followed by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel not long afterward. But that was about 24 hours before Prime Minister Theresa May of Britain got through — a striking break from diplomatic practice given the close alliance between the United States and Britain.\nDespite the haphazard nature of Trump’s early calls with world leaders, Trump’s advisers said the transition team was not suffering unusual setbacks. They argued that they were hard at work behind the scenes dealing with the same troubles that incoming presidents have faced for decades.\nAdvertisement\n“Completely normal,” said Rudy Giuliani, the former New York mayor, who emerged on Tuesday as the leading contender to be Trump’s secretary of state. “It happened in the Reagan transition. Clinton had delays in hiring people.”\nGiuliani, who made his comments in a telephone interview, added: “This is a hard thing to do. Transitions always have glitches. This is an enormously complex process.”\nThe Associated Press reported that Giuliani seemed to be angling for secretary of state. But Trump’s transition team was reviewing Giuliani’s paid consulting work for foreign governments, which could delay a nomination or bump Giuliani to a different position, according to a person briefed on the matter but not authorized to speak publicly about it.\nGiuliani founded his own firm, Giuliani Partners, in 2001, and helped businesses on behalf of foreign governments, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and Venezuela.\nThere were reports within the transition of score-settling.\nOne member of the transition team said that at least one reason Rogers had fallen out of favor among Trump’s advisers was that as chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, he had overseen a report about the 2012 attacks on the US diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, which concluded that the Obama administration had not intentionally misled the public about the events there. That report echoed the findings of numerous other government investigations.\nThe report’s conclusions were at odds with the campaign position of Trump, who repeatedly blamed Hillary Clinton, his Democratic opponent and the secretary of state during the attacks, for the resulting deaths of four Americans.\nIn another surprising development on Tuesday, retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson is unlikely to join the administration but will remain an informal adviser.\n‘‘The way I’m leaning is to work from the outside and not from the inside,’’ Carson said in an interview.\nCarson, who is Trump’s highest-profile African-American supporter, has been under consideration for several positions in Trump’s Cabinet.\nEliot A. Cohen, a former State Department official who criticized Trump during the campaign but said after his election that he would keep an open mind about advising him, said Tuesday on Twitter that he had changed his opinion. After speaking to the transition team, he wrote, he had “changed my recommendation: stay away. They’re angry, arrogant, screaming ‘you LOST!’ Will be ugly.”\nCohen, a conservative Republican who served under President George W. Bush, said Trump transition officials had excoriated him after he offered names of people who might serve in the administration.\n“They think of these jobs as lollipops,” Cohen said in an interview.\nSenator John McCain of Arizona, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, weighed in as well. On Tuesday he issued a blunt warning to Trump and his emerging foreign policy team not to be taken in by President Vladimir Putin of Russia, whom Trump praised during the campaign.\n“The Obama administration’s last attempt at resetting relations with Russia culminated in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine and military intervention in the Middle East,” McCain said.\nSome of the early transition difficulties may reflect the fact that Trump, who has no governing experience or Washington network and campaigned as an agent of change, does not have a long list of establishment figures from the Bush era to tap. His allies suggested that might ultimately prove positive for Trump if he were able to assemble a functioning team that would bring new perspectives to his administration.\nFor advice on building Trump’s national security team, his inner circle has been relying on three hawkish current and former US officials: Representative Devin Nunes, a California Republican who is chairman of the House Intelligence Committee; Peter Hoekstra, a former Republican congressman and former chairman of the intelligence committee; and Frank Gaffney, a Pentagon official during the Reagan administration and a founder of the Center for Security Policy.\nGaffney has long advanced baseless conspiracy theories, including that President Obama might be a closet Muslim. The Southern Poverty Law Center described him as “one of America’s most notorious Islamophobes.”\nProminent donors to Trump were also having little success in recruiting people for rank-and-file posts in his administration. Rebekah Mercer, the scion of a powerful family of conservative donors and a member of Trump’s executive transition committee, has said in conversations with Republican operatives and previous administration officials that she was having trouble finding takers for posts at the undersecretary level and below, according to a person familiar with her outreach efforts. She told them the transition team was more than a month behind schedule and on a tight timeline.\nIn another delay, Pence did not sign legally required paperwork to allow his team to begin collaborating with Obama’s aides until Tuesday evening, a transition spokesman said. Christie on Election Day signed a memorandum of understanding to put the process into motion as soon as the outcome was determined, but once he was ousted from the job, Pence had to sign a new agreement.\nThe paperwork serves as a nondisclosure agreement for both sides, ensuring that members of the president-elect’s team do not divulge information about the inner workings of the government that they learn during the transition, and that the president’s aides do not reveal anything they may discover about the incoming administration’s plans.\nTeams throughout the federal government and at the White House that have prepared briefing materials and status reports for the incoming president’s team are on standby, waiting to begin passing the information to Trump’s staff.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, officials at key agencies including the Justice and Defense Departments said they had received no contact from the president-elect’s team.",

      "text": " Google+\nKayana Szymczak for the Boston Globe\nRabbi Elaine Zecher, Olivia Gordon, 13, and Cantor Roy Einhorn sang at Temple Israel of Boston.\nBy Lisa Wangsness Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nBoston’s Jewish population is becoming more urban, and less suburban. Intermarriage — once feared as an existential threat to the Jewish community — may actually be fueling its growth. Traditional synagogue membership is declining, but independent congregations and other alternative groups are on the rise .\nA survey of the region’s Jewish community, commissioned by Combined Jewish Philanthropies and conducted by Brandeis University researchers once every 10 years, describes a community — and a younger generation in particular — that is far less like likely to claim denominational and institutional allegiances. Yet the vast majority retain connections to Jewish spirituality, community, and culture in a variety of ways: joining Jewish book clubs, attending Passover seders, or volunteering for Jewish community service groups.\nAdvertisement\nIdentifying with a particular movement within Judaism, such as Reform or Conservative, “means less and less to the next generation,” said Barry Shrage, president of Combined Jewish Philanthropies. “They care about experiences of meaning, joy, and excellence, and they don’t much care about the labels.”\nThe study found about 250,000 Jewish adults and children in Greater Boston, or almost 7 percent of the total population. Excluding the North Shore — which wasn’t part of the last survey — the Jewish population has grown by nearly 5 percent since 2005, even as the number of non-Hispanic whites shrank by about 3 percent over the same period.\nGet Fast Forward The geographic distribution of Jews in Greater Boston has long tracked the path of immigrant communities across the country — moving, as Jews assimilated and prospered, from the inner city to the suburbs and beyond.\nBut the new data reveal a changing geographic distribution in the Jewish community : For the last two decades, about half of the area’s Jews have lived in the suburbs. That number has begun to shrink in more recent years, led by 18- to 34-year-old Jews who prefer life in Boston, Cambridge, and Somerville. The proportion of the Jewish community living in the heavily Jewish neighborhoods of Brighton, Brookline, and Newton has remained constant at about 30 percent.\nGil Preuss, executive vice president of Combined Jewish Philanthropies, attributed the growth to several factors: Boston’s attraction to young professionals, an increase in the Israeli population, and perhaps for some who were here a decade ago but didn’t identify as Jews, a growing sense of belonging in a diverse Jewish community.\nAdvertisement\n“For the past 20 to 25 years, we have worked very hard . . . to create a more welcome and open community for interfaith households, for LGTBQ households, for people with disabilities,” he said.\nBut Professor Jonathan Sarna, a historian of American Judaism at Brandeis, said he thought the growth must be partly attributable to the large number of interfaith families with at least one Jewish parent who consistently choose to raise their kids exclusively Jewish: about 57 percent, roughly the same as in 2005. The trend, he noted, comports with national statistics.\nIn families with two parents who are Jewish, children were less likely to attend religious school than they were 10 years ago. But interfaith families are more likely to send their kids to school.\nOn Monday evening, 16-year-old Petra Huang sang an after-dinner blessing with a large group of teens at “The Tent,” a Jewish learning community for teens at Temple Israel, Boston’s largest Reform synagogue, that offers classes in Jewish contemporary art, social justice, and even yoga and Judaism. Her mother grew up Catholic but converted to Judaism when Huang was in first grade; her father is not religious. Prayer is important to her — “I don’t believe in God, it’s more like putting something out there into the atmosphere” — and so is the close-knit community she has developed.\n“If I do have kids, I definitely do want to raise them in a synagogue,” she said. “It’s something to give to someone to hang onto in a time of need. And I feel like I belong to this community.”\nMirroring national trends that show declining allegiance to religious institutions and denominations, synagogue membership has fallen off. Just one-fourth of Jews in Greater Boston are dues-paying members of brick-and-mortar synagogues. And while 74 percent of Jews a decade ago identified as affiliated with the Conservative or Reform movements, just 44 percent do today. Sarna called it an “astonishing drop.”\nMany synagogues closed or merged in the last decade, he noted, with synagogue membership dropping amid the 2008 recession. Sarna said the numbers suggest “a lot of those people didn’t come back.”\nThe survey doesn’t fully capture the complexity on the ground, though. In Wellesley, Temple Beth Elohim has grown from about 500 families to more than 1,200 over the past 15 years. Rabbi Joel Sisenwinehas noted “an incredible burst of energy” among families with young children and interfaith families; above all, he said, they are looking for connection and meaning.\n“We say that each time you leave the synagogue, we hope you leave it as a better person than when you entered,” he said.\nAram Boghosian for The Boston Globe\nAri Filler and Petra Huang, both 16, listened to Rabbi Matt Soffer at The Tent school at Temple Israel of Boston.\nSome Jews are choosing different forms of affiliation than in the past. Almost 1 in 5 of households that belong to a Jewish congregation now affiliate with synagogue alternatives, such as an independent congregation (havurah), prayer group (minyan), or Chabad (the Hasidic movement known for its outreach).\nThe Boston Workmen’s Circle, a Brookline organization that grew out of the labor movement in New York the early 20th century, offers Shabbat and holiday services, Jewish cultural education, and organizes for social justice; it has seen its membership rise from 380 members last year to 435 this year.\nAmong the new members is Haley Kossek, 25, a labor organizer who lives in Jamaica Plain. She regularly attends Friday night Shabbos services at members’ homes that feature conversations about Jewish heritage and social justice. Her heroines are the Yiddish-speaking women who led labor unions in the early 20th century.\n“Workmen’s Circle offers me a place to be able to act in the history of my Jewish heritage, in honor of those heroines,” she said.\nThese groups seem to be especially vibrant in cities.\nThe new life is evident at Temple Israel’s Riverway Project, a community of people in their 20s and 30s that combines socializing, learning, and spirituality. It is bursting at the seams, with 300 people attending its monthly Shabbat dinners.\n“I happen to be pretty optimistic about young adults’ spiritual vitality,” said Rabbi Matt Soffer of Temple Israel.",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nJawaher Noor (right), of Quincy, and Nechka Mars, of Hyde Park, shared a laugh at the luncheon. Noor is originally from Somalia and Mars from Haiti.\nBy Cristela Guerra Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nInside the Great Hall at the State House on Tuesday, immigrants were welcomed with open arms.\nHundreds of people from around the world gathered and shared a hot meal, listened to personal stories, and were offered a bit of hope that everything would be OK, that America would be OK.\nAdvertisement\nIt was the Massachusetts Immigrant and Refugee Advocacy Coalition’s 12th annual Thanksgiving luncheon, and it came a week to the day since the election of Donald Trump, a week that has bristled with protest and poisonous words.\nThose seated at the luncheon hailed from China and Somalia, from Haiti and the Dominican Republic. They were surrounded by immigrant advocates, state representatives and senators, and teachers.\nGet Fast Forward “The hateful rhetoric and the sadness and despair is not the answer, and it doesn’t serve any purpose,” said Eva Millona, executive director of the immigrant coalition, widely known by the acronym MIRA. “So today’s luncheon is about unity, it’s about coming together, and recognizing that immigrants and refugees are an asset.”\nMelanie Marcus, an English as a second language instructor with an organization called South Boston en Accion, spoke with a few of her students. Thomas Alexis, 37, of the Dominican Republic, listened as Marcus pointed toward Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, who made her way through the crowd, introducing herself, and asking people where they were from. “She is in solidarity with us,” Marcus told those around the table.\nLast week, following the presidential election, Marcus’s students struggled to process the results.\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nAhmed Salat, of Somalia, placed his hand over his heart as the national anthem was sung.\nAdvertisement\n“I tried to make them understand that not everyone who voted for Trump hates immigrants,” Marcus said. This fear was familiar to many in attendance, including Alexis.\n“A lot of people are afraid of Trump,” Alexis said in Spanish. “But I’m not afraid. There are many things he cannot do. I’m telling them to be calm.\n“This is a country of laws.”\nHealey emphasized her role in using the laws to protect their rights.\nShe offered a simple, but poignant message: You are not alone.\n“I stand with immigrants and immigrant communities,” Healey said.\nThis week, the attorney general announced the introduction of a hot line for reports of harassment and discrimination. She read the phone number out loud and told the group they could come forward without fear of reprisal. Her office would also be vigilant and keeping a close eye on what Trump’s administration proposed, she said.\nAlejandra St. Guillen, director of Mayor Martin J. Walsh’s Office for Immigrant Advancement, spoke on behalf of Walsh. She smiled as she looked around the room.\n“This is such a beautiful sight,” St. Guillen said. “I wish everyone could come up and see the room because this is America.”\nIn the speech that St. Guillen read, Walsh made clear his support of immigrants: “If you live in or around Boston, know that you are a valued member of our city and our community regardless of your place of birth, your immigration status, your faith tradition, or your appearance.”\nOutside the great hall, Nicole Lin, 35, originally from China, ate with others.\nShe found the topic of Trump and the issue of racial discrimination distasteful.\n“Immigrants are important,” she said. “They do jobs other people don’t want to do.”\nNearby, Patricia Merlos, who works with a program called Roca that helps high-risk young people find work and learn life skills, said her 10-year-old helped her after the election.\n“His teachers showed solidarity with Latino students,” Merlos said in Spanish. “They told him no one here is better or worse than anyone else. That we’re all equal under the Constitution.”\nThrough Roca, Merlos worked with Zulma Mestanza, 24, of Revere. Mestanza is one of thousands protected by the Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors, known as the Dream Act. She wants to be a nurse. She came to the United States as a little girl with her sister from El Salvador. This country is the only one they’ve truly ever known.\nIn comparison, Jawaher Noor, 20, of Quincy, arrived from Kuwait in September.\nShe’s here to study, she said. She’s learning English. She wants to be a psychologist.\nShe loves to talk and to listen to people.\nA Muslim woman, she’s well aware of hateful rhetoric, though she hasn’t encountered it herself.\nShe’s aware of what Trump and others say about the religion she loves.\nShe misses home. She’s building a new life. She hopes people accept her as she is.\n“I hope they’re not afraid,” Noor said. “Everything will be fine.”\nCristela Guerra can be reached at cristela.guerra@globe.com .",

      "title": "Facebook’s fake news problem: What’s its responsibility?",
      "text": " Google+\nAP/File\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg in April.\nBy Barbara Ortutay Associated Press November 16, 2016\nNEW YORK — Facebook is under fire for failing to rein in fake and biased news stories that some believe may have swayed the presidential election. Its predicament stems from this basic conundrum: It exercises great control over the news its users see, but it declines to assume the editorial responsibility that traditional publishers do.\nOn Monday, Facebook took a minor step to address the issue, clarifying its advertising policy to emphasize that it won’t display ads on sites that run information that is ‘‘illegal, misleading or deceptive, which includes fake news.’’ The company said it was merely making explicit a policy that was already implied.\nAdvertisement\nIts move followed a similar step by Google earlier on Monday, after the search giant acknowledged that it had let a false article about the election results slip into its list of recommended news stories.\nIn the case of both companies, the aim is to discourage fake-news sites by depriving them of revenue.\nGet Breaking News Facebook is also said to be facing brewing internal turmoil over its influence and what it can and should do about it.\nView Story Twitter introduces mute button for online trolls Twitter has unveiled several new measures to curb the online abuse, although the changes are unlikely to be far-reaching enough to quiet the company’s critics.\n‘We have to take all of Trump’s promises seriously,’ Oliver says\nEmployees have expressed concern over Facebook’s role in spreading misinformation and racist memes largely associated with the alt-right, according to The New York Times and BuzzFeed. Some have reportedly formed an unofficial task force to investigate the role the company played in the election.\nFounder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg, however, insists that Facebook remains a neutral technology platform where its users can share anything they want, with only a tiny fraction of it fake or problematic.\nAdvertisement\nLast week, Zuckerberg called the idea that voters might have been influenced by what they saw on Facebook — fake, uber-partisan stories, such as a false one about Pope Francis endorsing Donald Trump for president — ‘‘pretty crazy.’’\nPeople update to Facebook so frequently that the company has no choice but to filter what everyone sees in their news feeds — the main artery through which users see posts from their friends, family, businesses, news sources and celebrities they follow.\nThe company’s secret algorithms are designed to deliver the posts from friends and other sources that will draw people in and lead them to read and click and ‘‘like’’ and share — ‘‘maximizing their engagement,’’ in Facebook’s jargon.\nFacebook frequently tweaks its algorithm to improve engagement. Various changes have been aimed at shutting out sites that promote clickbait and other garbage that users say they don’t want to see, even as they click on it and share away. When users are surrounded by posts they want to see, they’re more likely to stick around.\nThat’s key to Facebook’s advertising business. But it can be problematic when it comes to false but highly interesting posts.\nFacebook’s news feed ‘‘maximizes for engagement. As we’ve learned in this election, bulls--t is highly engaging,’’ former Facebook product designer Bobby Goodlatte wrote in an Election Day post . ‘‘Highly partisan, fact-light outlets’’ on both the right and the left, he wrote, ‘‘have no concern for the truth, and really only care for engagement. ... It’s now clear that democracy suffers if our news environment incentivizes bulls--t.’’\nSocial media companies today have to acknowledge that they are news organizations, said Jeffrey Herbst, president and CEO of the Newseum, a journalism museum in Washington. ‘‘Not like news companies of the 20th century,’’ he added. ‘‘But not just pipes where people get their news. They determine what is news.’’\nIn a post Saturday night, Zuckerberg rejected that idea.\n‘‘News and media are not the primary things people do on Facebook, so I find it odd when people insist we call ourselves a news or media company in order to acknowledge its importance,’’ he wrote. ‘‘Facebook is mostly about helping people stay connected with friends and family.’’\nBack in 2013, Zuckerberg said he wanted Facebook to be people’s ‘‘own personal newspaper,’’ one that delivers the stories most interesting and important to them. That’s still the company’s goal — though minus any reference to itself as a media company of any kind.\nOf course, fake stuff has existed on the internet long before Facebook. And under the law, Facebook is no more responsible for what appears on its site than ‘‘the paper mills that print newspapers are responsible for their content,’’ said Steve Jones, a professor at the University of Illinois at Chicago who studies communication technology.\nAt the same time, Jones said he thinks the broader issue of Facebook’s responsibility is one that’s going to be ‘‘debated forever.’’\n‘‘Even the notion of truth is something that’s highly contested at this point,’’ he said.",

      "text": " Google+\nPete Marovich for The Boston Globe/File\nWashington lobbyists, centered around the K Street corridor, have seen a sharp drop in business during the Obama years.\nBy Matt Viser Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nWASHINGTON — The swamp is not being drained. Instead, it’s about to be restocked with a species that is used to running this town and taking advantage of nearly every opportunity: lobbyists.\nDespite President-elect Donald Trump’s campaign vow to “drain the swamp” and “phase out” lobbyists, well-connected influencers are circling because, after years of gridlock, the skids are again being greased for action in a Republican-controlled capital. Something might actually get done in Washington.\nAdvertisement\nTrump is pushing for a large infusion of spending on infrastructure. He wants to bulk up the military. Tax reform? That too. Sweeping changes to the health insurance industry? Yep.\nAnd every issue draws a cadre of lobbyists, who had seen their number dip during the Obama years.\nGet Political Happy Hour “The hoses are on,” said Steve Elmendorf, a top Democratic lobbyist. “The swamp is filling up.”\nOn K Street, the lobbying corridor, those with even loose ties to Trump say their phones are constantly buzzing. Democratic-leaning firms are trying to figure out how to gain insight into a man they admittedly don’t understand. And good luck to anyone trying to predict what Trump — who relishes his reputation as a wily and unpredictable deal-maker — will end up doing.\n“The city has been in gridlock since 2006. There’s a lot of pent-up demand for a lot of things,” said Trent Lott, the former Senate majority leader who is now a powerful lobbyist. “When the Congress is working and the president is working, it enlivens the city. There will be challenges and opportunities for lobbyists.”\nAdvertisement\n“There have been a lot of people supportive of doing nothing and gridlock,” he added. “It’s time we be for something in this city.”\nOver President Obama’s eight years in office, the number of lobbyists has declined dramatically. In 2008, the year before Obama took over, there were 14,153 registered lobbyists, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. That declined nearly 25 percent by last year. The amount of spending, which had previously almost always increased, is down by about 2.5 percent.\nA large reason for the decrease is that Congress was lurching from crisis to crisis, rather than crafting sweeping legislation that brings lobbyists to the Hill. Only during the first two years of Obama’s presidency — when Democrats controlled the House and Senate — did the mood match the current level of anticipation.\nMuch of the next wave of action will focus on Republican promises to unwind some of Obama’s big legislative achievements.\n“The first two years of any new administration are busy, but Trump wants to change the tax code, overhaul the health care sector, and roll back regulations on Wall Street and the oil-and-gas industry,” said Patrick O’Connor, head of a strategic communications division at CGCN Group, a top Republican lobbying firm. “Add to that his desire to boost military spending and pass a $1 trillion infrastructure package, and it’s safe to say Washington will be working overtime for the foreseeable future.”\nOne of the things Trump has talked about pursuing first is a large infrastructure bill. He wants to fix airports, ailing bridges, and rebuild the urban centers of America. But that will test Republican alliances.\nTrump lost in most cities, which tend to be far more diverse than the rural coalition that lifted him to office. But cities, with strained mass transit systems, crumbling highways, and dilapidated airports, are where the greatest infrustracture spending is needed.\n‘Lobbyists are hired more for defense rather than offense. And man, people are playing defense right now because they don’t know what the Trump administration is going to be like.’\nScott Ferson, Liberty Square Group “There’s a big dichotomy in what people in Trump Tower want to do and what traditional Republicans in Washington want to do,” Elmendorf said. “With infrastructure, Trump talks about spending $1 trillion. But the deal fell apart [in 2015] when [Senator] Chuck Schumer wanted $275 billion and [House Speaker] Paul Ryan wanted $125 billion.”\nTrump has more experience doing the influencing than being influenced. And despite his lofty campaign claims to change the culture of Washington, Trump’s transition team is filled with lobbyists.\nHe has said that will change — and the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday night that all lobbyists on the transition team were being removed.",

      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) — Google wants to make digitizing your many boxes of old photo prints as easy as opening an app. The PhotoScan app for iPhones and Android phones will use the phone's camera to capture an old photo in four sections and stitch them together, much like a panorama shot. Google says this approach helps eliminate glare that can mar attempts to digitize a print by simply photographing the whole photo.\nThe app will make minor adjustments to restore color in faded photos and to aligned corners when the photo print is bent.\nJulia Winn, a product manager for the new app, said scanning photos with traditional scanners takes time, while third-party digitizing services cost money and require you to part with your photos temporarily, risking loss and damage.\nThe free app, released Tuesday, will work with photos on a table, a picture frame and an album. It will also digitize slides when projected on a wall. Winn said the resolution of the digitized photo will be comparable to that from a flatbed scanner.\nYou can store digitized versions on your phone or the online Google Photos service, which has unlimited storage for photos of up to 16 megapixels.\nOther photo features announced Tuesday include:\n— The main Google Photos app is getting additional editing controls. There are new filters for those who like automation and more granular controls for those who prefer manual editing. The new manual options include \"deep blue\" to give skies and water more color, without oversaturating the rest of the photo, and \"skin tone\" to adjust only the colors on skins.\n— The service will also automatically generate additional types of video highlights, with background music, from your collection of photos and videos. The service initially organized images only around location and date. It recently started creating reels following a kid growing up. A new type, called lullaby, will gather shots from a newborn's initial days. Coming next month: Christmas shots and happy moments from 2016. Pets and outdoor videos are coming in 2017.",

      "text": "Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and Google want kids to study computer science Carl Heastie, Google want kids to study computer science Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie and members of Google will visit the Cornerstone Academy Middle School in the Bronx on Thursday to get kids interested in STEM. (Mike Groll/AP) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS Wednesday,  44 AM \nAssembly Speaker Carl Heastie will team up with computer coders from the web giant Google for a Thursday rally at a Bronx public school urging kids to pursue studies in computer science. \nHeastie will join the Google brainiacs for the so-called CS First Roadshow to give a demonstration in coding for about 80 kids in grades 4-8 at the Cornerstone Academy Middle School in the Bronx. \nThe goal, Heastie said, is to ignite kids' passion for studying science, technology, engineering and math — better known as STEM. \n“Although the demand for individuals trained in STEM fields remains high, students often overlook STEM subjects during their education,” the powerful Bronx Democrat said. “If we can pique their interest early, the hope is that we can inspire them to be the future innovators of technology and pursue a field that has the potential for a lifelong career with far reaching impacts.” \nThursday's event is just the latest in Google's ongoing efforts to boost STEM in the city schools. \nThe company is working with the city and the telecom provider Sprint to create a program for free wireless internet access for the families of city students. \nGoogle also held free coding classes for city kids over the summer and participates in a variety of internship programs for city students. \n“Kids are exposed to technology at such an early age, but don't necessarily get to learn about why computer science should be an important part of their lives,” said Google spokesman Jamie Hill. “We want the next generation of students to be able to create technology, not just consume it.” Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "Google PhotoScan app helps digitise your old photos Google PhotoScan app helps digitise your old photos Google has launched PhotoScan, a new app to help people digitise their old printed photos. By: Tech Desk | Updated: November 16, 2016 11:35 am Google PhotoScan app ensures that pictures taken of these print photos don’t have crooked edges or glare.(Source: AP ) \nGoogle PhotoScan is a new app to help people digitise their old printed photos, which might be a part of old photo albums or hanging on the walls in their homes. Google’s new app will let users scan their old printed photos, and convert them into a digital print. Google’s blogpost explains their reason for launching the app: “We all have those old albums and boxes of photos, but we don’t take the time to digitize them because it’s just too hard to get it right.” \nAccording to Google, the PhotoScan app ensures that pictures taken of these print photos don’t have crooked edges or glare. The app is available for Android and iOS as well. The app will let users make digital copies in seconds. \nGoogle PhotoScan will detect edges, straighten the image, rotate it to the correct orientation, and remove glare as well. All scanned photos can be saved in one tap to the Google Photos app. \nSo how does the Google PhotoScan app work? When you first open the app, you have to give it access to the camera on your iOS or Android device. Once the camera is on, you can take the picture of your printed photograph. Google’s app will ask you move the cursor to four corners, marked in four circles around the picture. This will ensure a straight photo is taken, and once that is done, you see the final photo. \nAlso read: Google Duo video-calling app review: Simple, works well \nThere is an option to edit the photos and adjust the corners even after you have taken it. Just tap on the photo, you have taken and you will see an option to edit like adjust corners, rotate or even delete the photo. After adding the final touches, you can save the picture to Google Photos. \nGoogle has also added new features to the Photos app. Google Photos now has an improved auto-enhance feature and editing tools. A user can just open a photo and tap the pencil icon to start editing. Auto Enhance will show instant enhancements that a pro editor might make – like balancing exposure and saturation to bring out the details, says Google. \nGoogle has also added 12 new looks/filters for those who wish to change the look for their photos. Google says all of these use machine intelligence to complement the content of the photo. Google has also added advanced editing controls for Light and Color in order to boost photos. \nThe Google Photos app with the new photo editor will begin rolling out today across Android, iOS and the web. © The Indian Express Online Media Pvt Ltd Tags:",

      "text": "Google and Facebook finally announced steps to tackle fake news on their respective platforms this week following increasing pressure from critics eager to halt the flow of falsehoods online.\nBoth companies said they will prohibit fake news websites from advertising on their platforms, thus reducing the exposure of such articles to the public while also starving the companies of an important source of advertising income.\nThe move comes after the companies received a wave of criticism over its role in propagating misinformation, particularly in this election cycle in which many observed that a bitter partisan war was potentially worsened by polarizing news sources touting untrue assertions. While the technology companies have in the past been hesitant to mediate the flow of news, this change might signal a change in thought as they come to grip with the real-life implications of lackluster surveillance on their platforms.\nRecommended: Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. “While implied, we have updated the policy to explicitly clarify that this applies to fake news ,” a Facebook spokesman said, according to The Wall Street Journal. “We vigorously enforce our policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation. Our team will continue to closely vet all prospective publishers and monitor existing ones to ensure compliance.”\nTest your knowledge Are you savvy about social networks? Take our quiz to find out. Photos of the Day Photos of the Day 11/15 Facebook said it will explicitly ban fake news sites from using the Facebook Audience Network, a system that places ads on other websites and mobile apps. On Monday, Google said it will prevent Google ads from being placed on “pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose of the web property,” the company’s spokesperson said, a category that includes fake news sites.\nTechnology and social media companies are increasingly seeing themselves as victims of those who game the system to spread misinformation either with purposes to mislead the public or for personal profit, as Buzzfeed recently exposed in an investigation.\nMost recently on Monday, the top result for a Google search for the final results of the presidential elections is sourced to a random website that says Donald Trump has won both popular and electoral votes , The Washington Post reports (in fact, Hillary Clinton leads the popular vote). On the same day, another false Facebook trending story with more than 10,000 shares claimed that Denzel Washington backs Mr. Trump and that he called President Obama “anti-Christian,” as the Post points out. These come after a string of false news that trended throughout the campaign season that ranged from Hillary Clinton calling for civil war to Mike Pence insulting Mrs. Obama.\nTechnology companies have historically been hesitant to play editor to the information flowing through their platforms.\nLast week, Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg said it was a “crazy idea” to think that Facebook influenced the elections, emphasizing the role the technology company played was to disseminate information, not decide on content – a painful experience the company had with editors with its Trending topics previously. The company does prohibit certain content, such as nudity.\nBut a growing sense of responsibility among employees of tech companies may continue to add pressure on executives to take more drastic actions. As Buzzfeed reported on Monday, a group of Facebook employees took initiative to form an unofficial task force to investigate whether the company, used by 150 million Americans, is doing enough to address the problem.\n\"It’s not a crazy idea,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed of the assertion that Facebook influenced the election. \"What’s crazy is for [Mr. Zuckerberg] to come out and dismiss it like that, when he knows, and those of us at the company know, that fake news ran wild on our platform during the entire campaign season,\" a Facebook employee told Buzzfeed.\nCritics say even with the new policy, Facebook still has not addressed the proliferation of false news in the News feed. Both Facebook and Google have been taking steps over the years to label news sources as “satire” or “opinion,” while also allowing users to flag false content.",

      "text": "\nArtificial Intelligence, or AI, is becoming the next big thing in technology. Google has been making great progress in this field and has recently shown off its highly accurate AI image captioning system. \nBut the company has more to give. Meet Google’s latest AI experiment called “Quick, Draw.” At first glance, it looks like a simple drawing game designed for kids. But in reality, it’s quite an advanced tool, as it uses neural networks to try and figure the object you’re drawing.\nHere’s how it works. Quick, Draw first displays a written word (“boat”, “tree”…) and gives you 20 seconds to draw it using your mouse cursor. The tool will then — with the help of AI — try to figure out what that object is based on your artistic skills. It uses the same technology as Google Translate for handwriting recognition, and of course, learns from its mistakes the more you play with it.\nSee also: Great, now Google’s AI is coming up with its own encryption methods 3 weeks ago I’ve found the tool to be quite interesting, and although it sounds and looks simple and silly in a way, it’s actually a ton of fun and a bit addictive. After trying it out for the first time, I was prompted to draw a toothbrush, a sink, and a soccer ball. Unfortunately, Google didn’t give me any credit for my work, as it recognized my drawings as a fork, a potato, and a cookie. So, either Google’s new AI tool doesn’t work correctly, or my artistic skills aren’t as good as I’ve thought. I’m leaning more towards the second option.\nSo, if you want to test out your drawing skills, try the tool out for yourself by clicking the button below. And as always, share your first impressions with us in the comment section.\nQuick, Draw ",

      "text": "Google Search Will Help Find an ATM Near You Amid Cash Crunch Reddit \nIf you have been on a constant lookout for ATMs in your vicinity in hopes of withdrawing some cash, then Google's new tool is just for you. \nBelow the search box on google.co.in, you will now find the 'Find an ATM near you' link. Clicking this link will open Google Maps, which will use your location data to show you all the ATMs in your vicinity. \nThe feature is available on both desktops and mobile devices. \nUnfortunately, the Google Search tool does not show if the ATM has cash or not. It is essentially an integration of Google Maps' ATM finder feature, which has been available for long, in the Search home page. \nThere are, however, other tools you can use to find working ATMs near you. Websites like atmsearch.in and cashnocash.com claim to provide information on ATMs around you that are still dispensing cash. Walnut app and CMS ATM Finder are other tools that let you locate working ATMs in your vicinity. You can also use social media to track which ATMs have cash and how long the lines are.\nThe cash crunch and long lines outside ATMs and banks have become a common sight after the Rs. 500 and Rs. 1,000 notes were demonetised last week, rendering them useless. With not enough of the new currency notes available yet, the public has been keeping both eyes wide open for working ATMs.",

      "text": "Tags : Samsung - Samsung + Google - Google + OnePlus - OnePlus + Poof! The OnePlus 3T is no longer a figment of our collective wishful thinking. The device became official yesterday, November 15, after a low-key announcement.The new handset improves the specs of the phone in a few key areas - it has a larger battery crammed in the same body, snappier chipset, new 128GB storage option, as well as a large 16MP front-facing camera (up from 8MP). You can get all that for $439, $40 more than the price OnePlus 3 featured at launch. While it's gradually escaping its ultra-affordable origins, OnePlus has still kept the price of its newest phone pleasantly low. It's not the best deal on a Snapdragon 821 device we've seen, but it will probably end up being a great value for money to those folks not willing to spend $769 or more on a Google Pixel XL . Here's how the OnePlus 3T fares against the Google Pixel XL in our specs and size comparison combo. We've also thrown in a Galaxy S7 edge for good measure in there, too. First up, we will have to take the size comparison out of the way. 6.01 x 2.94 x 0.29 inches 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.35 mm 5.57 oz (158 g) 6.09 x 2.98 x 0.34 inches 154.72 x 75.74 x 8.6 mm 5.93 oz (168 g) 5.94 x 2.86 x 0.3 inches 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm 5.54 oz (157 g) Samsung Galaxy S7 edge To see the phones in real size or compare them with other models, visit our Visual Phone Size Comparison page. Done yet? Now let's inspect the specs sheets of the three devices and see which one offers the very best bang for the buck: OnePlus 3T vs Google Pixel XL vs Samsung Galaxy S7 edge",

      "text": "Facing a growing backlash over the role that fake news and hate speech may have played in the recent election, three of Silicon Valley’s largest tech companies have announced plans to try to address the problem.\nGoogle and Facebook have said they will update their advertising policies to target misleading ads that direct people to fake news sites. Meanwhile, USA Today reported that Twitter has closed the accounts of several notable alt-right personalities.\nThe news comes as the nation remains in shock over Donald Trump’s upset victory in the presidential election.\nOver the weekend, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg insisted that the amount of fake news on the platform remains tiny, and could hardly have swayed the outcome. Still, the Trump campaign is now bragging about how Facebook’s platform helped them win the election.\nGoogle was drawn into the fray this week when an obviously fake news site that incorrectly claimed Trump won the popular vote shot to the top of search results.\nAll these companies face a massive task, and it’s not clear how much they can really do to stem fake news, hate speech and bullying. At the same time, their brands and appeal to advertisers, not to mention users, could be at risk if the problem is ignored.\n",

      "text": "Follow About | \nA daily digest of IT news, curated from blogs, forums and news sites around the web each morning. We highlight the key commentary and demystify the real story. Google's PhotoScan make digitizing old photos easy More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 16, 2016 3:33 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nIt is a question as old as time -- or at least as old as digital photos: What is the best way to digitize old pictures? \nThe answer is easy -- a dedicated photo scanner. But, if you don't want to drop the cash on one of those and spend all the time it takes to actually scan individual pictures, Google Photos thinks it has a pretty good solution in it's new app. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we digitize pictures of our brother's '80s mullet to share with the world. \nSo what is this app? Danny Zepeda has the background : Google...announced a new...app called PhotoScan that lets you digitize your old photo collection with ease. ... Digitizing old pictures with your smartphone has become the common method for preserving old memories, but it’s not perfect. PhotoScan makes the process easier thanks to an intuitive design and Google’s smarts...The quality of the image using PhotoScan won’t be as good if you used a dedicated scanner, but it is...better than using your stock camera app. \nBut what makes PhotoScan special? And how does it work? Harry McCracken has the details : There are plenty of...smartphone scanner apps...but many are optimized for documents rather than photos, and I haven't seen any that deal with...problems...from glare on an image to the difficulty of holding your phone at the proper angle. PhotoScan steps you through snapping four overlapping sections of your print photo using a clever bit of augmented reality: It superimposes four dots on the screen, then has you move your phone around to lasso each dot with a circle...Then it intelligently detects edges, straightens and stitches together the four images, removes the glare, and generally polishes up the results. It will even try to rotate the photo automatically if necessary. \nSounds good, but what is going on behind the scenes? Michael Nunez is in the know : What the app is doing...is essentially taking four images of the printed photo and stacking them...on top of each other. The app automatically removes bright white pixels caused by glares. It identifies glares by looking at pixels that move between each scan. The app automatically applies...other image correction including tweaks to color and exposure. You can also edit those settings yourself. \nAnd what do you do with the photos once they are scanned? Jake Smith can tell us : Photos can be saved to your phone's internal storage, or Google Photos to be organized, searchable, and shared. Google Photos...offers unlimited photo storage. PhotoScan doesn't automatically upload to Google Photos...The iOS, Android, and web app began rolling out Tuesday. \nSpeaking of Google Photos, any other big announcements? (See what I did there?) Abner Li fills us in : Google Photos is also getting a number of new photo editing features...in the form of sliders for Light and Color, including: Exposure, Contrast, Whites, Highlights, and Shadows. ... Auto enhance now makes “pro editor” enhancements to photos like balancing exposure and saturation to bring out the details. Filters...use machine intelligence to make edits based on the individual photo. Brightness, darkness, warmth, or saturation is taken into account before applying each of the 12 styles. \nSo what was Google's motivation to create this app? Jingyu Cui, a software engineer with Google Photos, tells us : We all have...old albums and boxes of photos, but we don’t...digitize them because it’s just too hard to get it right. We don’t want to mail away our original copy, buying a scanner is costly and time consuming, and if you try to take a photo of a photo, you end up with crooked edges and glare. ... We knew there had to be a better way, so we’re introducing PhotoScan, a brand new, standalone app...that easily scans just about any photo, free, from anywhere. \nWhat do users think? Brian Tong has an opinion : Google's PhotoScan...is LEGIT! Scan old photos directly to your phone. No glare. RELATED TOPICS",

The move is seen as a vote of confidence for Britain’s prospects after Brexit. Read more MPs concerned over ‘secretive’ Google tax deal \nThe company didn’t provide any details on the cost, but experts put the figure at over £1 billion. \nThe 10-storey, 650,000 sq ft building will be built next to Google’s existing offices in King’s Cross, central London. Thomas Heatherwick, who created the new London bus, the Olympic cauldron and the garden bridge across the Thames, has designed it. \nAccording to Google Chief Executive Sundar Pichai, computer science has a great future in Britain. He cited the talent pool, educational institutions, and passion for innovation present in the country. \n\"That's why we are investing in London in both engineering talent and infrastructure,\" Pichai told the BBC. \n“We are committed to the UK and excited to continue our investment in our new King’s Cross campus,” he added. \nAfter the EU referendum, many raised doubts whether Google would go ahead with its delayed plans for a new building announced three years ago. Pichai warned that the UK government’s expected crackdown on immigration after the Brexit vote runs counter to Google’s ideals. — RT (@RT_com) May 24, 2016 \nChancellor Philip Hammond said the confirmation of Google’s expansion was a “big vote of confidence in Britain’s leading position as a global tech hub and more evidence that leading firms are choosing to invest here.\" \nLondon’s mayor Sadiq Khan welcomed the announcement, saying it ended fears Brexit would damage the capital’s position as the leading European technology hub. “This is a vote of confidence in our great city – creating high-skilled jobs, supporting growth and demonstrating that London is open to business, new investment and talent from around the globe,” he said. \nAt present Google employs around 4,000 people in the UK.",

      "text": "Apple's iPhone is no longer the best Google phone That may sound absurd, but hear me out. \nA simple \"G\" on the back of the Pixel lets you know it's made by Google. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet \nHaving spent the better part of the past month using Google's Pixel XL smartphone , I still think Google made one of the best phones of the year. \nI have zero hesitation recommending either Pixel phone to a friend, family member, or a complete stranger when asked. In fact, my recommendations as of right now are the iPhone 7 Plus or Pixel XL. You can't go wrong with either one. \nThe Pixel's camera takes crisp photos and is incredibly fast. The phone itself is a workhorse, with long battery life and practically no slowdown even as it's pushed to its limits. \nHowever, what I find most appealing about the Pixel isn't something you'll find on the spec sheet. It's that, for the first time, there's an Android phone that's also the best Google phone money can buy. \nThat may sound absurd, but hear me out. Apple hardware, Google software \nAs someone who is deeply rooted in Apple's hardware and Google's software, I've long said the best Google phone money can buy is the iPhone. \nGoogle doesn't shy away from making its software products available on iOS. Look at the list of Google apps in the App Store, and then name one of its major software products that isn't available for the iPhone. Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, Slides... They're all there. Chrome, Gmail, Google Maps... They're all there, too. \nGranted, the apps often lack some key functionality, and it feels as if Google has given up on keeping pace with Apple's latest software features and design guidelines. For example, last week's update to the Gmail app was the first major update in nearly four years. At the end of the day, however, the apps are available and usable. \nWith so many variables and inconsistent experiences across Android devices (Samsung pushing its services alongside Google's; LG still trying to make heavily customized Android skins work; the Nexus line struggling to find a purpose), a true Google phone has never really existed. Android devices up until now have primarily been a mishmash of two different approaches butting heads, hoping to make two companies some money along the way. \nApple's hardware design and reliable camera combined with Googles' apps running on iOS made the case all on its own. Pixelation of Google services \nEverything about the Pixel is unapologetically Google. \nStarting with the G logo on the back to the startup animation centering around Google and not the familiar green Android robot, Android has taken a backseat to Google when it comes to the Pixel. \nAdding to the value of Google's phone is the fact that Google Assistant is -- for the time being -- exclusive to the Pixel. Furthermore, Google Photos now offers unlimited video and photo backup for Pixel owners. \nAssistant and unlimited Photos storage are two services those who are entrenched in Google services won't find on the iPhone or another Android device.

By: PTI | New Delhi | Published:November 16, 2016 6:47 pm The Supreme Court of India. (File Photo) \nSearch engines like Google , Yahoo and Microsoft were on Wednesday asked to “delete” within 36 hours the advertisements, hosted by them, pertaining to pre-natal sex determination in India by the Supreme Court which directed the Centre to appoint a nodal agency to monitor the websites. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy said that the nodal agency would inform these search engines about any such advertisements on the websites and Indian arms of Google, Microsoft and Yahoo would delete them within 36 hours. \n“We direct the Union of India to constitute a nodal agency which would give advertisments on TV, radio and in newspapers….that if anybody comes across anything which identify a girl or a boy (at pre-natal stage), it should be brought to the notice of the nodal agency. “Once it is brought to the notice of the nodal agency, it shall inform the search engines and they, after receiving the information, are obliged to delete it within 36 hours and inform the nodal agency,” the bench said. \nThe apex court, which fixed the matter for further hearing on February 17 next year, said the “interim arrangement” would continue till the issue pertaining to advertisements relating to pre-natal sex determination was “debated” upon before it. During the hearing, the bench expressed concern over the declining sex ratio and said, “Whether one will have a boy or a girl, that kind of information is not necessary in India. The sex ratio is going down here and we are concerned about that.” \n“We had passed an order recently on this. Whether you are making money or not we are not concerned with that. The 1994 (Pre-Conception and Pre-Natal Diagnostic Techniques) Act says nobody shall propagate (pre-natal sex determination) and if anyone is propagating, it has to be stopped,” it said. “Whatever is prohibited under the Act cannot go through it (websites),” the bench observed, adding, “If anyone comes across anything which offends or has an impact on the sex ratio in India, it shall be removed by the search engines within 36 hours.” \nSenior advocate Abhishek Manu Singhvi, who was appearing for Google India Pvt Ltd, said they have complied with the earlier order passed by the apex court in the matter and they have already taken steps to block any such advertisements. The counsel appearing for the other search engines also said that they have taken steps to comply with the provisions of the Act. However, they contended that the matter requires further debate.

      "text": "\nOne of these things is not entirely like the other. Here's how to choose between the Pixel and Pixel XL.\nThere's no doubt that the question that's plaguing you this very moment as you salivate over the varying color options for the Pixel and Pixel XL is: Which one is even worth bringing home? Well, that will depend entirely on your need, but we've put together a quick, helpful guide so that you can choose the right phone for you.\nWhat's the difference? \nUnlike last year's Google event, which revealed two different Nexus devices developed by two entirely different manufacturers, this year's Pixel and Pixel XL are both made by Taiwan-based HTC. As a result, they both look quite similar—so much so, that from far away, you can't really tell them apart, despite their differing screen sizes.\nThe biggest difference between the Pixel and Pixel XL are their display and battery sizes, though the 5.5-inch Pixel XL isn't that much larger than its 5-inch sibling. The Pixel also feels more like a refined, matte HTC One A9, while the Pixel XL sits in the hand as comfortably as the OnePlus 3 . But no matter which one you pick, both devices have high-quality AMOLED screens that are both vividly colored and plenty pixel dense for the average smartphone user.\nMore: Google Pixel review \nHere's a quick specification breakdown for those of you who just want the basics:\nCategory Google Pixel Google Pixel XL Operating System Android 7.1 with Google UI Android 7.1 with Google UI Processor Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 RAM 4GB 4GB Display 5-inch AMOLED 1920x1080 5.5-inch AMOLED 2560x1440 Rear Camera 12MP f/2.0\n1.55-micron pixels\nPDAF 12MP f/2.0\n1.55-micron pixels\nPDAF Front camera 8MP 8MP Battery 2,770mAh non-removable 3,450mAh non-removable Charging Fast charging Fast charging Connectivity USB Type-C, Bluetooth 4.2 USB Type-C, Bluetooth 4.2 Fingerprint sensor Yes Yes Storage 32GB/128GB 32GB/128GB IP rating IP53 IP53 Colors Quite Black, Very Silver, Really Blue Quite Black, Very Silver, Really Blue Price $649 $769 But which one is better ? \nWell, let's weigh the options. The Pixel features a regular 1080p AMOLED display with a 2,770 mAh battery, so chances are that its battery life might manage a longer day than the Pixel XL's Quad HD AMOLED display and 3,450 mAh battery simply because the display doesn't require as many resources. Then again, larger batteries do usually manage longer up-time.\nHere's more on battery performance from executive editor Alex Dobie's initial review of the Pixel and Pixel XL:\nIn both cases you're likely to get a decent, full day of use out of the Pixel and Pixel XL, though the XL fares a little better on heavier days.\nThe XL never failed to get me through a full day of regular use, with a typical day getting me 14 to 16 hours off charger with 4.5 to 5 hours of screen on time. That's with mixed use across LTE and Wi-Fi, and approaches what I've gotten out of the Galaxy S7 edge earlier in the year. Unremarkable for a high-end Android phone perhaps, but the major difference I noticed with the Pixel XL was how it weathered heavy use that much better than many rivals.\nIt all comes down to whether you want a phone to be usable in one hand, or one that can double as a small tablet, used with Nougat's new Multi Window mode in landscape with two apps side by side. You're still getting the same Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, coupled with 4GB of RAM and the improved 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, as well as rear-facing fingerprint sensor, USB Type-C, and fast charging. Both phones are also IP53 rated, so you don't have to go into freakout mode if either phone gets rained on.\nMore: The Google Pixel is IP53 rated — here's what that means \nWhich one is better for virtual reality? \nIt's a good idea to buy a Pixel XL over a smaller Pixel if virtual reality is your primary concern. The Pixel and Pixel XL are both Daydream-ready , but the larger Pixel XL has a higher-resolution display, which translates to better per-eye density in VR. This gives the XL a definite advantage for current content and it helps with future-proofing as well. The larger battery may also eke a few more minutes in battery life while playing VR, which is nice.\nYou also probably shouldn't get a white Pixel for VR .\nMore: Using the smaller pixel with Google Daydream is a big compromise \nWhat's the price difference between the two? The Pixel starts at $649 for the 32GB version, while the Pixel XL starts at a whopping $769. If you bump up the storage to 128GB, it's an extra $100. And if you add on device protection, that's another $100. These smartphones aren't as cheap as Nexuses used to be.\nWhich carriers support the devices? \nBoth the Pixel and Pixel XL are sold unlocked through the official Google Store. They're compatible with all four of the major carrier networks in the U.S., in addition to Google's own Project Fi. You can also purchase either device through Verizon, though you'll want to hold off on doing so outright unless you've got a grandfathered subsidy that the carrier is offering you.\nThe Verizon variant of both devices include three Verizon apps, an encrypted bootloader — a bummer for tinkerers — and you'll have to wait on Big Red before receiving any software updates. Alternatively, if you're a Verizon subscriber and you buy it unlocked, you'll still have access to advanced features like VoLTE and Wi-Fi Calling.\nMore: Don't buy your Pixel at Verizon \nWant to know more?

      "title": "Photoscan by Google Turns Your Phone Into a Photo Scanner",
      "text": "Photoscan by Google Turns Your Phone Into a Photo Scanner Google's Photoscan app is free and available now The app is fast and easy to use The resulting image is largely dependent on your phone's camera \nOn Tuesday, Google launched Photoscan , an app that helps you quickly digitise your old, printed photos you may have lying around. \nThe idea is simple, but the problem itself can be a little tricky to solve. Expecting the average user to click a single image and properly save an old photograph may not be the best idea. The lighting needs to be just right, otherwise you're going to deal with unwanted glare over some part of the photo. \nGoogle's answer to this problem is simple and impressive - it takes four pictures and then stitches them together to provide a single composite image. According to Google, Photoscan also makes minor adjustments to restore colour in faded photographs, and to align corners if the photo is bent. \nIt sounds like a great idea, and we wanted to see how well it would work, so we decided to put Photoscan to the test. We didn't have too many pictures at hand, apart from some very old black and white photos that accompanied a journal of Beatrix Potter. Faded old black and white photos sounded like the perfect test for the app, and we went about snapping a few clicks. Using Photoscan is extremely simple - something we've come to expect from Google's homegrown apps. When you launch the app it asks for permission to use the camera, and then the main screen is a simple camera view with the text \"Position photo within frame\" on top, and a big shutter button at the bottom, with a small flash icon to the left and a help icon to the right.\nPhotoscan is pretty barebones, but that makes sure that you can quickly get scanning. Tap the shutter, and it takes the first shot - then it paints four white dots on the screen, and your job is to point the camera at each of those dots, in much the same way that the Google Camera app guides you to take 360-degree photos. The process is straightforward, and 'scanning' an individual picture takes under 20 seconds. You can go through a full photo album in just a few minutes, if you want to. \nPhotoscan is a lot faster than using a scanner, if you have one to begin with. You could of course try photographing the image directly using the camera app, but we've done that in the past, and it could involve multiple attempts to get the focus right, the lighting right, and the framing right, and ends up taking almost as long as scanning would. \nOn the other hand, there are some issues - although the app is quick and easy to use, we found that the images were dark with the flash on, and looked much better with the flash switched off. Unfortunately, this led to some focus issues - even if you get the focus just perfect for the first shot, you don't have the same level of control over the four subsequent shots taken while moving the phone to the white dots. This led to some blurry photos which you'd hope the software could have corrected. \nOnce you're done snapping the picture, you can edit it in Photoscan - you can move all four corners in a non-rectangular shape to properly capture the snapped photo. Once you're done making the backups, just tap the Save All button, and it'll back up the pictures to your linked Google Photo's account. \nUnfortunately, Photoscan is still completely dependent on the camera in your phone - if you have a new iPhone, or one of these other camera-focused phones , then you'll probably make nice, crisp backups. If you have a sub-Rs. 10,000 phone with a crappy camera, then while the resulting pictures look okay on the phone's screen, they're not really all that good to look at on your computer. \nIt's an understandable shortcoming, but given that the majority of users' phones here still don't have top of the line cameras, the usability of this app will be questionable, at least in markets such as India. You would hope that by making you take multiple images and stitching them together, Photoscan could have smoothed away some focus issues as well; unfortunately, that's not the case here, which is a real let-down. \nPhotoscan is available as a free download on Android and iOS",

      "text": "Google Allo will up your weak emoji game Allo's new feature predicts smileys based on context clues. Share Save \nAccording to Google's announcement for Allo's latest features, people only use three percent of all emojis available. Well, the Allo team don't want their creations to go to waste, so they've launched \"Smart Smiley\" to make sure you discover emojis you won't typically use. When you tap on the Smart Smiley button while you're typing a message, the chat app will conjure up a list of suggestions based on context clues. It could suggest the burger, noodles, curry or cutlery emoticons when you type the word \"food,\" or the alligator emoji when you type \"later,\" sort of like what happens in iOS 10's Messages app. The feature can make suggestions before you even type anything based on your conversation history. \nIn addition to Smart Smiley, Google is also releasing the Fantastic Beasts sticker pack it promised when it launched the ability to cast spells with your Android phone. There's also a new feature that helps you discover new sticker packs faster, as well as new background themes for the app. Google has begun rolling out these features today -- if you don't have them yet, you're bound to get them in the next few days. For now, though, Smart Smiley will only work if your language is set to English, so you'll have to wait a bit longer if you prefer chatting in your native tongue.",

      "text": "Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news \"news\" Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news \"news\" Commentary: The internet has a problem with fake news. Here's an easy fix. Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news \"news\" 0 Share: Up Next Does the internet have a fake-news problem? \nIn the words of our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, \"Half of what you read on the internet is not true.\" \nThat's the problem when you give billions of people access to a global forum where they can pretty much post whatever they want. You never know if what you're reading is true, which is why we choose sites we think offer legitimate news. Maybe you wonder if that story about a one-eyed baby has been fact checked, maybe you don't. You shouldn't have to, since we all expect what we read on our trusted news sites to actually be true. \nSo now we have Facebook and Google being called out for showcasing \"fake news\" stories . It's a big deal because nearly 45 percent of US adults say they rely on the world's largest social network and world's largest search engine for news , even though they're not traditional \"media\" companies. \nThat last part is important. Photo by John Greim, LightRocket via Getty Images \nMost media companies have some rules on fact checking. CNET's reporters and reviewers have to verify information they're writing and then back that up by linking to original source material like company press releases, videos and websites. \nBut there are plenty of other sites that just run content collected from across the internet and argue they don't have to check because they didn't write it. They're just content distributors/aggregators. \nThat's certainly how Mark Zuckerberg seemed to deflect Facebook's role in promoting and sharing fake news that critics say helped Donald Trump win the election. Like this one about the supposed murder-suicide of an FBI agent investigating Clinton's leaked emails (not true) . Or the one claiming Pope Francis endorsed Trump (also not true). \nThe idea that Facebook could even sway the election is \"crazy,\" Zuckerberg argued because less than 1 percent of all the share posts are fake . But the math doesn't add up. Given that 1.2 billion people use the social media site daily , about 12 million see at least one fake news story a day, Airbnb's director of research (and former Facebooker) points out in a post. Can you imagine if The New York Times or the Guardian made up 1 percent of their stories, he says. \nNo, I can't actually. \nZuckerberg says Facebook isn't a media company, so it's really not its job to ferret out fake news. But Facebook does need to \"proceed very carefully\" in taking on a role where it's expected to identify \"truth.\" (Quotes around truth are his.) \n\"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual,\" Zuckerberg wrote in a November 12 post. \n\"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\" \nEarlier this week, we learned Google had prominently placed a fake news story about election results in the search engine's widely-read news section. Contrary to what you might have read on Google, Trump didn't win the popular vote -- at least not according to the latest official count. \nGoogle, which uses an algorithm to vet news sources, owned up to making a mistake . \"The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\" a Google spokeswoman said Monday. \"We clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\" \nMeanwhile, Google CEO CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC , \"There should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.\" \nHe didn't say how. \nMedia and tech experts have offered up a few solutions for Facebook and Google over the past few days. That includes everything from being more open about how their algorithms highlight stories (and potentially make it easy for bad actors to game the results) to tagging stories that have been called out as hoaxes. \nI have my own idea. \nHey, Facebook and Google -- why don't you set up editorial boards with respected journalists reviewing your services and suggesting ways to improve the better? All the mass layoffs in media means it's a good time for talent acquisition. \nI also have an even simpler solution. How about Facebook and Google stop calling their news feeds \"news\"? Google could maybe rebrand \"Google News\" as \"Articles & Other Miscellany\" or \"Stories Lots of People Are Reading.\" \nAnd instead of News Feed, Facebook might call it \"Stuff from the Internet,\" \"What S/He Said,\" or \"Facebook's Believe It Or Not -- Your Choice.\" \nOr maybe just \"Stories That Won't Affect an Election.\" \nThe winking face emoji is optional. \nFacebook and Google can't ignore their role in distributing deliberately false info to millions of people. A group of Facebook employees has reportedly set up a task force to discuss ways to fight the problem. Both companies on Monday said they won't let fake news sites use their ad-selling software anymore. That sounds noble until you remember they're both ad-funded services and advertisers don't want their brands associated with ugly, questionable content. \nFor now, remember what Lincoln said. I can't say it any better than that.",

Taiwan asks Apple and Google to ditch Uber 0 Share: \nTaiwan wants Google and Apple's help to get rid of the Uber app. Photo by Carl Court, Getty Images \nThe government of Taiwan asked Apple and Google to step into its ongoing dispute with ride-hailing service Uber on Wednesday. \nTaiwanese officials want the two Silicon Valley tech giants to remove Uber from the App Store and Google Play respectively, according to Reuters . It is also seeking the removal of UberEATS, the company's food delivery service, which launched in Taiwan on Tuesday. \nUber operates within Taiwan as a technology company, but the government has said that this is a misrepresentation of its service. It believes that instead Uber should be classified as a transportation company, which would mean it should have been paying more taxes. \nUber has caused many a ruckus around the world as it disrupts existing models and regulations in countries it launches in. The company told Reuters that it is discussing the situation with the Taiwanese authorities and complies by all local regulations. \nUber, Google and Apple did not respond to requests for comment.",

      "text": "Google AI experiments help you appreciate neural networks And they're more than a little entertaining. Share Save \nSure, you may know that neural networks are spicing up your photos and translating languages , but what if you want a better appreciation of how they function? Google can help. It just launched an AI Experiments site that puts machine learning to work in a direct (and often entertaining) way. The highlight by far is Giorgio Cam -- put an object in front of your phone or PC camera and the AI will rattle off a quick rhyme based on what it thinks it's seeing. It's surprisingly accurate, fast and occasionally chuckle-worthy. \nOther experiments are worth checking out, although you may need to compile the code or watch to get a feel for them. Quick, Draw! is effectively AI Pictionary ; Infinite Drum Machine gathers sounds by similarity, and lets you sequence them into simple tracks; Bird Sounds uses neural networking to arrange and visualize calls based on their qualities (say, shrill versus melodic). Sadly, one of the most promising, Thing Translator, isn't usable unless you download the source code and build it yourself. \nThankfully, the list is likely to get larger. Google is taking submissions, and it's fairly open-minded as to how contributors design their projects. If enough people step up to the plate, AI Experiments could be the go-to place for anyone wanting a primer on what machine learning can do.",

      "text": "Google Allo is getting a suggested emoji button Plus some new stickers and themes share Google is switching up the emoji shortcut button on its Allo chat app . Now, instead of just bringing up the emoji keyboard, the “Smart Smiley” button will bring up a list of suggested emoji and stickers that are relevant to what you’re typing. For now, the feature will only work with English. It’s an extension of Allo’s prediction algorithm, which so far has been used to give you suggested one-tap replies to text messages that are based on the way that you actually chat. Those “suggestion chips” will also contain emoji and stickers now, too. Google is also taking full advantage of its #brand relationship with the new Harry Potter movie Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them with a new sticker pack. There are also new themes for chats if you don’t like the standard bubble background. All these features are nice, I suppose, and the emoji suggestions are an example of Google leaning on its AI strengths. But they’re very far from the features that people want most from Allo . Multi-device support probably tops that list for most users, but perhaps a more important feature would be stronger default privacy protections. Allo does have an incognito mode, but the company recently reneged on a promise that it wouldn’t permanently store default conversation logs on its servers. More From The Verge",

      "text": "Daniel Terdiman 11.16.16 11:00 AM \nThis summer, I spent a few days in Florence, Italy, where, for the better part of 72 hours, I walked and walked the same narrow streets that Leonardo Da Vinci, Michelangelo, and Dante once prowled. So, last week, when I found myself looking down on the city from on high—a few hundred feet above Florence—its famous red-tiled roofs stretching as far as the eye could see in every direction, my first reaction was to see if I could navigate my way from the city’s centerpiece, the Duomo, or cathedral, to the apartment I’d stayed in. \nIn the background, gentle music played as I tried to figure out which streets to take to get there. But then, before I could trace the path all the way to that Airbnb, I was suddenly standing above Tokyo with that same bird's-eye view. \nLet’s be honest: What are you supposed to think when that’s what you see in front of you? \"I’ve got a whole Godzilla thing going on,\" I said out loud. \nAt least a couple of the people in the room with me laughed, I think. The room was on the second floor of Google’s San Francisco office, and, with an HTC Vive strapped to my head, I was immersed in a demo of Google Earth VR, a fantastic, all new, purpose-built re-imagining of the venerable tool that takes the same satellite data and imagery that’s been available to us for years in our browsers and on our mobile devices, and presents in all the glory that’s possible from a multi-year Google project manifested inside high-end consumer virtual reality. \nIt's yet one more example of Google building all-new versions of its most popular tools for virtual reality. It had previously released all-new iterations of YouTube, Street View, Google Photos, and Play Movies for its Daydream mobile VR platform . \nLaunching today for Vive, Google Earth VR is meant, said Dominik Kaeser, the project’s engineering lead, to give users the ability to \"literally walk around cities and step over skyscrapers....[and] go to the places that matter to you personally, or places that are difficult to get to, like the top of Mt. Fuji.\" \nGoogle knew that if it wanted to build a version of Earth for VR, it was vital both to take advantage of the medium’s tools, even while making it seem familiar to longtime desktop or mobile users. That meant maintaining some of the user experience—things like the way you navigate from point to point, zoom in and out, or grab the map and drag to move it—while building in all new ways to explore the world in full, immersive 3D with beautiful graphics. \nThat’s one reason Google Earth VR was built for the Vive and not virtual reality systems like Google’s own, Daydream , or Samsung’s Gear VR: To do it right, you need to be able to move around in a physical space and reach out and touch things, and for the moment, Vive is the best system available for doing that. The Touch Controllers for Facebook-owned Oculus' Rift come out next month and will add similar functionality to that platform, but Google isn't talking about plans at the moment to expand Google Earth VR for Rift. \nTo promote the new project, Google made a nice video showcasing how it works. In it, you travel from Florence to Hoover Dam (ducking under the new bridge there) to New York City and on and on through mountain ranges, national monuments, famous landmarks, and so on. It gives you a peek at how lovely it all looks in rich 3D. The problem with the video, of course, is that it’s in 2D, and doesn’t quite impart what this is all about. Only at the very end, as the logo appears, do you actually get a hint of what this really promises: a woman is standing in the middle of some mountains, towering over them, exploring. \nThat visual tells the story. And imagine this—place yourself in a long, Italian alpine valley. You can walk around in it, your view from high above everything, but eventually you’ll reach the limits of the physical space you’re in (because, you know, walls). Never fear if you still want to walk to the end of that valley: You simply reach out, using one of the two Vive controllers, grab the other end of the valley and pull it forward. Voila! \nThe team behind the project wanted other magical elements as well, so they made it possible to \"fly\" from point to point. Pick a new location to visit, and indeed, the world begins to spin and you soar through the air toward your destination. \nBut they were also aware that in VR, there’s a danger of motion sickness if you feel untethered from the space you’re in. \nKaeser explained that the team worried that users might feel nauseous when flying to a destination if everything in their field of view was moving. So they came up with a technique they call \"tunnel vision,\" which restricts your view of what you’re flying over, blurs everything else, and shows a grid at where your feet are. That, they discovered, alleviated the problem. Tutorials And Tours \nAlthough the team made sure to build in UI elements that will be familiar to longtime Google Earth users, they knew that many people trying Earth VR would have little or no experience with the Vive. So they crafted a tutorial that leads you through, explaining how to use the Vive’s controllers to do things like spin the globe and pick a point to travel to, or rotate the planet, or transition from daylight to nighttime, and so on. \nAlthough Google knew many users might want to jump straight to the place they live or where they grew up, they realized others wouldn’t know where to start. So there’s also a series of tours that take you through curated locations. It’s a nice way of seeing what’s possible with the tool, as once you’ve worked your way through a tour, you’re raring to go do your own exploring. \nUnfortunately, not everyone will be able to get their hands on Google Earth VR, as it’s only for the Vive right now, a VR system that by year’s end is likely to have less than half a million users worldwide. \nStill, the project, along with Google’s Tilt Brush , shows that the company is interested in exploring what’s possible with high-end virtual reality, and demonstrates that it is making substantial investments in time and energy beyond its own Daydream and Cardboard platforms.

      "title": "What the Proliferation of Fake News on Google and Facebook Means for Advertisers",
      "text": "Agency execs weigh in By Marty Swant , Christopher Heine November 16, 2016, 11:38 AM EST Technology The digital giants are being challenged by the fake-news epidemic. Getty Images Just days after facing harsh criticism for allowing fake news stories to be read unchecked across the internet, Google and Facebook are now rushing to put in place policies that cut off advertising dollars for websites publishing fictional information. The move—which aims to potentially stem the flow of false information that some say helped propel Republican President-elect Donald Trump's march to the White House—could be a first step by the tech giants toward clearing themselves of content that's seen as harmful to both users and the brands that place their names next to it. But if they can't clear the weeds fast enough, will advertising dollars head to purer grounds? Or, with Google and Facebook's amazing scale, does it even matter to brands? \"I think it should [matter],\" said Red Interactive Agency's CEO Brian Lovell. \"Responsible brands want to advertise on responsible platforms.\" According to Sastry Rachakonda, CEO of iQuanti, advertisers don't have a lot of options if they want to go where their audiences are, especially if Facebook and Google continue to get 85 cents of every new dollar spent on digital advertising in the U.S. \"Both these platforms are by far the most effective digital-marketing options—because of the sheer size of audiences and targeting capabilities,\" Rachakonda said. \"Given that users are rapidly gravitating to consuming content online, we don't see advertisers pulling back.\" Others think it might be time to reconsider. \"It may be right for certain brands to pause social advertising while sentiment (which their ads appear around) settles into a more positive, hopeful tone,\" said Caitlin McDaniel, associate director of social media at GSD&M. \"But the majority of brands' reputations with consumers will not be tarnished by continuing business as usual with Facebook.\" The map is fake. The story is incredibly misleading. And it's spreading like crazy all over Facebook. pic.twitter.com/8MmAZaKxwz — Mike Baker (@ByMikeBaker) November 15, 2016 While advertisers are not necessarily going to pull the plug overnight and walk away, the battle against fake news could be part of the process for better defining Facebook's role in an information era, said Kyle Bunch, head of social strategy at R/GA. Bunch also raised another question: If brands are liable for the claims they make about products, why shouldn't news be held to the same standard? \"I think Facebook has been very good at being a tech company when it serves them and being a media company when it serves them,\" he said. He later added: \"In less than 20 years, we've gone from Bill Clinton getting impeached after the former president said [in relation to the Monica Lewinsky scandal], 'it depends on what the definition of 'is' is', to the largest media outlet in the world basically hiding behind the same dodge. One has to appreciate one of the world's largest companies embracing existentialism so wholeheartedly.\" And in a year when truth is truly stranger than fiction, Oxford Dictionaries on Tuesday named \"post-truth\" as its 2016 Word of the Year, defining it as \"an adjective defined as 'relating to or denoting circumstances in which objective facts are less influential in shaping public opinion than appeals to emotion and personal belief.\" Post-truth is the Oxford Dictionaries Word of the Year 2016. Find out more: https://t.co/jxETqZMxsu pic.twitter.com/MVMuMyf83K — Oxford Dictionaries (@OxfordWords) November 16, 2016 What this means for brands Bunch noted that Facebook and Google aren't the only companies to blame. He said others—including Twitter, Taboola and Outbrain—also share some of the guilt for allowing fake news and click bait to spread either through user-generated content or sensational stories. \"You couldn't be a billion-dollar business in America until now and put stuff out there that's blatantly wrong and not have some accountability for it,\" Bunch said. Monik Sanghvi, chief strategy officer at Organic, said it matters to big brand advertisers that major tech companies like Facebook, Google and others do everything they can to ensure quality information is distributed across their platforms. \"Big brands have always cared greatly about 'where' their brand is placed and, even in the programmatic era,\" Sanghvi said. \"There are platforms of questionable quality where brands work to ensure they do not appear.\" Sanghvi added, \"While it's doubtful that there would be an immediate and sizeable backlash, the topic could easily gain steam if the 'scale platforms' do nothing to change this perception.\" This year has taught tech watchers that incremental shifts yield outsized results, said Topher Burns, group director of product innovation at Deep Focus. \"There are many reasons for Facebook and Google to address this problem,\" he said. \"First off, the signal itself is important: that platforms care about the type of content they popularize and are taking a stand. It's also important from a long-term perspective. Facebook left this election cycle being seen as the place to find radicalization and propaganda, to fight with your friends and family. They've got to protect the value of their inventory by taking a firm stance on quality.\" According to Scott Linzer, vp of owned media at iCrossing, brands expect advertisers and tech companies to identity where content is fake. He said tech companies need to do something to help right the ship. Even if fake stories exist, he said consumers will continue looking for accurate information. \"While there is scrutiny and concern, ultimately, I think the platforms learn from this,\" he said. How tech giants are trying to change On Monday, Facebook amended its Audience Network policy to state that it will not display ads in websites or mobile apps that hold fake news. That same day, Google revealed a similar mandate that prohibits ads from being published on fake news sites. \"We clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms,\" a Google spokeswoman said in a statement to The Wall Street Journal. Linzer of iCrossing, added, \"And I think the more they showcase how they learn, and either tighten controls or use technology to understand the content correctly and whether it's true or not, I think it [could] even more solidify their prominence as leading brands where advertisers still see a good opportunity to continue their investments.\" News organizations are also keeping a close eye on what the tech companies do next. Francesco Marconi, strategy manager for the Associated Press, said the approach to news distribution should be reconsidered in order to avoid incentives for fake news and sensationalist click bait. He said the election was an \"inflection point,\" or a \"wake-up call,\" for the importance of factual information. \"Since the advent of the internet, publishers have been trying to leverage distribution channels — such as search engine and social media networks — to drive traffic to their own websites,\" he said. \"The amount of money earned corresponds at least indirectly with the size of the audience visiting their pages, which creates an incentive to generate as much as content as possible.\" According to Marconi, further innovation is needed in storytelling so that focus is placed more on quality than commodity information. On the platform side, that means tech companies like Twitter, Google and Facebook creating a safe environment for news consumers in the same ways they monitor inappropriate content. That could come in the form of a quality score, which could be created in close collaboration with news media companies. Creating a fake news database To help people properly consume information they see online, one professor has taken it upon herself to crowdsource a massive list of fake news websites that she and others have seen across the internet. Melissa Zimdars, an assistant professor of communications and media at Merrimack College in Massachusetts, has already identified hundreds—with at least 300 more waiting to be vetted and potentially added to the growing list. As a result, some people have created a plug-in for Google Chrome that lets readers see if what they're reading is on Zimdars' list of questionable websites. \"I do think that for a lot of people who just don't know or who are maybe more moderate, maybe people who are open to different political and cultural discourses, that this might help them more,\" she said. \"Some people might never be reached by this technology, but others could be greatly served by it.\" Facebook, in particular, has had success in cleaning out its platform when it comes to misleading-information problems in the past. Six years ago, consumer scams—that often damaged brands like IKEA — were far more common on the site than they are now. Issues surrounding \"news,\" though, may be much more difficult to grapple with. Zimdars said that labeling certain websites as \"fake\" could open them up to taking sides on defining what is true and not true. \"It will likely be seen as another example of an 'establishment' or a corporate controlling of information,\" she said, \"so I would imagine that among a lot of groups, it could be read as trying to stifle the truth.\" So what is truth, and who defines it in the age of the internet? Facebook might still be wrestling through how it answers that age-old question. On Tuesday afternoon Vice correspondent Nellie Bowles tweeted out an exchanged she had with a Facebook spokesperson while trying to learn more about the company's plans.

      "text": " Google+\nLEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images\nTwitter recently suspended many more accounts associated with the alt-right.\nBy Travis M. Andrews The Washington Post November 16, 2016\nEver since alt-right provocateur Milo Yiannopoulous sent actress Leslie Jones a string of deeply offensive tweets, insulting the comedian’s race and intelligence, Twitter has made banning abusive accounts a priority.\nAt the time, the company offered a statement, which read in part:\nAdvertisement\n‘‘. . . our rules prohibit inciting or engaging in the targeted abuse or harassment of others . . . we’ve seen an uptick in the number of accounts violating these policies and have taken enforcement actions against these accounts, ranging from warnings that also require the deletion of Tweets violating our policies to permanent suspension.\n‘‘We know many people believe we have not done enough to curb this type of behavior on Twitter. We agree. We are continuing to invest heavily in improving our tools and enforcement systems to better allow us to identify and take faster action on abuse as it’s happening and prevent repeat offenders.’’\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Recently Twitter suspended many more accounts associated with the alt-right, which is the Southern Poverty Law Center describes as ‘‘a set of far-right ideologies, groups and individuals whose core belief is that ‘white identity’ is under attack by multicultural forces using ‘political correctness’ and ‘social justice’ to undermine white people and ‘their’ civilization.’’\nView Story What’s ‘alt-’ about the alt-right? The “alt-right” is making a name for itself in the mainstream. But what’s in a name?\nTwitter tries to clamp down on abuse Twitter bars Milo Yiannopoulos in effort to show it is cracking down\nIncluded among them was the verified account of Richard Spencer, which The Washington Post described as a leader of the alt-right and ‘‘one of the most media-savvy thinkers in the movement.’’\nTwitter also suspended the account of the Virginia-based National Policy Institute, an alt-right, white nationalist think tank of which Spencer is the president, and that of Radix Journal, a magazine run by Spencer.\nAdvertisement\nPaul Town, Pax Dickinson, Ricky Vaughn and John Rivers also had their accounts suspended.\nIn response, Spencer posted a video to YouTube, in which he said, ‘‘I am alive physically, but digitally speaking, there has been execution squads across the alt-right.’’\n‘‘It’s corporate Stalinism, in the sense that there is a great purge going on, and they’re purging people on the basis of their views,’’ Spencer said.\nHe said these suspensions are unlike Yiannopoulous’s.\n‘‘I supported people like Milo when they were banned from Twitter, but Milo was engaging in something that could be called ‘harassment,’’’ Spencer said of the man who used the platform to call Jones ‘‘barely literate,’’ ‘‘fat and ugly, ugly, ugly, fat’’ and ‘‘a hot black dude.’’\nAdded Spencer, ‘‘Again, I totally think he should have stayed.’’\nSpencer, though, drew a sharp distinction between the way Yiannopoulous used the platform and the way he did.\n‘‘I and a number of other people who just got banned were not even trolling,’’ he said. ‘‘I was using Twitter just like I always used Twitter: to give people some updates and maybe comment on a news story here and there.’’\nInstead, Spencer said he thinks this was a ‘‘coordinated effort to just wipe out alt-right Twitter’’ in response to arguments that social media helped elected Donald Trump.\n‘‘Twitter and probably Facebook too . . . I think they are deeply triggered by Trump’s election,’’ Spencer said. ‘‘I think they’re triggered by this narrative that social media helped elect Trump and they think that they have to do something about it. Well, the fact is social media did help elect Trump.’’\nHeidi Beirich, spokeswoman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, told the USA Today that the organization had previously asked Twitter to remove more than 100 accounts of white supremacists but said on Monday (before the suspensions), ‘‘They have done nothing.’’\nSpencer compared the account suspensions to the Night of Long Knives, also known as Operation Hummingbird in which Hitler, ordered ‘‘a bloody purge of his own political party, assassinating hundreds of Nazis whom he believed had the potential to become political enemies in the future,’’ according to History.com.\nThe video’s title is ‘‘The Knight of Long Knives,’’ obviously a play on the operation’s name.\nMany on Twitter expressed confusion and outrage concerning Spencer’s suspension.\n‘‘Richard Spencer advocates for my people, doesn’t hate anyone, is a gentleman, and a friend, and Twitter suspended him,’’ one user tweeted. ‘‘Pax Dickinson and Richard Spencer have been banned from Twitter. The left knows social media helped Trump and is cracking down,’’ tweeted another.\nSpencer said that this is could be seen as a victory for the alt-right movement.\n‘‘This is a clear sign that we have power,’’ he said. ‘‘Even if it’s in our own little small way . . . we have power, and we’re changing the world.’’\nTwitter did not respond to a request for comment from USA Today, stating, ‘‘We don’t comment on individual accounts, for privacy and security reasons.’’\nFinally, Spencer mentioned that he might transition to GAB, a social media platform used by many who identify with the alt-right. It prides itself on free speech. On its landing page, the platform included a Quote: from writer and poet Charles Bukowski, ‘‘Censorship is the tool of those who have the need to hide actualities from themselves and from others.’’\nRelated Donald Trump denies seeking security clearances for children Twitter bars Milo Yiannopoulos in effort to show it is cracking down Twitter tries to clamp down on abuse",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Bryan Marquard Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nBoston Symphony Orchestra archives\nJules Eskin.\nAs a 5-year-old, Jules Eskin sat close when his father played the cello, drawn by the instrument’s sound – and more.\n“Tone! Tone! That’s the whole story! It’s tone! If you have a tone, you can do anything,” Mr. Eskin said in an interview posted on opuscello.com . “Without tone, you do nothing! And once you have that tone, you need to speak with that tone!” Then he Quote: d his former teacher, the legendary cellist Gregor Piatigorsky: “You must taste the blood of that tone!”\nAdvertisement\nA renowned musician in his own right, Mr. Eskin became the Boston Symphony Orchestra’s principal cellist in 1964, and his tenure was expansive as the talent he brought to decades of performances from Symphony Hall to China. He was 85 when he died of cancer Tuesday in his Brookline home.\n“Jules Eskin is a legend in the cello world,” the cellist Yo-Yo Ma said in a statement through the BSO. “A role model for me, he has always embodied the best of what a cellist could be – a consummate musician as a solo artist, an ensemble musician, and as principal cellist of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.”\nGet Today's Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Performing under BSO music directors Erich Leinsdorf, William Steinberg, Seiji Ozawa, James Levine, and Andris Nelsons, Mr. Eskin was featured as a soloist in pieces including Ernest Bloch’s “Schelomo,” the Brahms Double Concerto, Beethoven’s Triple Concerto, William Schuman’s “A Song of Orpheus,” and Richard Strauss’s “Don Quixote.”\nReviewing a 1982 “Don Quixote” performance, Globe critic Richard Dyer said Mr. Eskin “was simply magnificent as the Knight of the Doleful Countenance because he is so magnificent as a cellist. Eskin is such a strong and centered and unfussed musician; his playing was noble in tone and in character.”\nIn 1964, Mr. Eskin also became a founding member of the Boston Symphony Chamber Players, which at the time was the only chamber ensemble composed of a major orchestra’s principal players, according to the BSO. The ensemble’s 2011 recording “Profanes et Sacrees: 20th-Century French Chamber Music” was nominated for a Grammy.\nAdvertisement\n“There is no doubt that Jules Eskin will be counted as one of the legendary cellists of the 20th and 21st centuries,” Mark Volpe, the BSO’s managing director, said in a statement.\nMalcolm Lowe, the BSO’s concertmaster, added that Mr. Eskin “embodied the heart and soul of our string section. He had an inspired musicality and infallible instinct coupled with a masterful understanding of the cello, its sound, and its role in all of the music that we played. His sound was always present, always poignant, and always incredibly moving.”\nOn Feb. 6, Mr. Eskin performed for the final time with the BSO as Nelsons conducted Prokofiev’s “Romeo and Juliet.” In a statement, Nelsons said Mr. Eskin “brought the orchestra such a wealth of experience and influenced the glorious sound of the orchestra for more than half a century, a staggering commitment for which we owe him so much.”\nBorn in Philadelphia, Jules Louis Eskin was introduced to the cello by his father, Samuel, a tailor who emigrated from Russia and auditioned unsuccessfully for the Philadelphia Orchestra. Instead, he played in small orchestras for silent movies. At 7, Mr. Eskin had already been taking piano lessons for two years when his father bought him a cello. “I used to have little contests with my father, who had a very nice tone,” he said told opuscello.com. “He would say: ‘Let’s see who can play this the most beautifully.’ ”\nThe extended family was musical, too. Mr. Eskin’s second-cousin Mark Ludwig is a BSO violist; Mark’s brother Michael is a former Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra concertmaster. Mr. Eskin’s cousin Irving Ludwig – father to Mark and Michael – was a longtime Philadelphia Orchestra violinist. “This has been as natural to us as a craftsman giving his trade to his children,” Mr. Eskin told the Globe in 2012 .\nAs a teenager, he told opuscello.com, “I was ready to flee the family home.” Mr. Eskin auditioned when the Dallas Symphony’s conductor was in Philadelphia and, at 16, was offered a contract.\nHe also studied at the Philadelphia Musical Academy and at the Curtis Institute of Music, where Piatigorsky was one of his teachers. During the Korean War, Mr. Eskin enlisted to play in the Army band, “which was a sort of Glenn Miller-type orchestra,” he recalled. While in the Army, he won a Walter W. Naumburg Foundation award in 1954 , and subsequently performed a debut Town Hall recital in New York City.\nAfter leaving the Army, he stayed in New York for several years to play with what was then the City Center Opera, and later moved to the Cleveland Orchestra, where he spent three years as principal cello under conductor George Szell.\nMr. Eskin, who as a teenager had been a fellowship student at Tanglewood Music Center with Serge Koussevitzky conducting, auditioned in 1964 to become the BSO’s principal cellist. In the years since, he traveled extensively with the orchestra internationally, including the historic 1979 tour of China when Ozawa was music director.\nNearly as passionate with non-musical endeavors, Mr. Eskin was known among other things for his love of fast sports cars and his ability to do chin-ups. “He’s a renaissance man. He was an outdoor hiker and traveler, and he opened up many people’s eyes to the world,” said his son Sacha of Honolulu.\n“He was not only an artist and a musician, he was very loving. He shared with me many things – how to do things, how to be the person I wanted to be,” Sacha said, adding that his father “was very creative and very soulful. His music was from the soul. You can’t repeat it; you can’t remake it.”\nMr. Eskin, whose earlier marriages ended in divorce, married BSO violinist Aza Raykhtsaum in 1986, a few years after she joined the orchestra. The two were “in love since shortly after we laid eyes on one another,” she told the Globe in 2012.\n“Jules said I was the love of his life and he cherished me. I loved him dearly,” she added in an interview Tuesday. “He was my soulmate musically, intellectually, emotionally. We had an incredible bond and we made music together 24 hours a day. We were never separated. It was an incredible love story. We were basically one – one soul.”\nIn addition to his wife and son, Mr. Eskin leaves his older son, David of Yorktown Heights, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Anna Raykhtsaum Tratt of New Rochelle, N.Y.; and five grandchildren.\nA memorial service will be held at 3 p.m. Wednesday in Stanetsky Memorial Chapels in Brookline. Burial will follow.\n“Jules had an uncanny ability to pull at your heart strings when he played. I think some of the most beautiful sounds that I’ve ever heard came out of his cello,” said his good friend Arnold Steinhardt, a founder and first violinist of the Guarneri String Quartet.\nFor Mr. Eskin, integral to those sounds was the tone he coaxed from his cello, which was there from the beginning. “I had it immediately as a child,” he told opuscello.com. “It’s crucial. You have to hear it in your ear.”\nBryan Marquard can be reached at bryan.marquard@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Robert Weisman Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nA pair of local venture capital firms said Wednesday that they are leading a $48.5 million funding round to launch Magenta Therapeutics, a Cambridge biotech aiming to develop drugs that can be used in stem cell transplants to treat blood and immunological disorders.\nThird Rock Ventures of Boston and Atlas Venture of Cambridge are licensing technology developed in labs at Harvard-affiliated Massachusetts General and Boston Children’s hospitals to help power Magenta’s effort to create safer and more effective stem cell procedures. The companies are known for backing early-stage life sciences companies in the Boston area.\nAdvertisement\n“The challenge today is that many patients never receive effective transplants,” said Jason Gardner, a veteran biopharma executive who has been tapped as Magenta’s chief executive. “We know a lot more about the science now, and we think it’s ripe to be taken to patients.”\nWhile it is officially launching Wednesday, the startup has been working out of the Atlas offices in Technology Square for more than a year. It recently moved into larger quarters as the first tenant in the Forsyth Entrepreneurial Science Center , a new incubator outside Kendall Square. It has about 20 scientists and researchers, and Gardner said the staff will double over the next year.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Gardner, 45, a Liverpool, England, native who did postdoctoral work at Harvard and built the stem cell business unit at British drug giant GlaxoSmithKline PLC, joined Atlas last year as an entrepreneur in residence before launching Magenta. Third Rock, which had been investigating a stem cell venture of its own, ultimately decided to join forces with Atlas.\n“We both wanted to start a transformative company in the stem cell space,” said Bruce Booth, a partner in the Atlas life sciences group. “We’re trying to broaden the applications.”\nWhile stem cell transplants have been around for about 50 years, they are seldom used outside the cancer field — and even there are usually a last resort — because of the high risk of death, according to Magenta’s founders. By improving techniques for harvesting stem cells from the blood and a stem cell recovery process known as engraftment, Magenta hopes to make transplants safer for patients with blood disorders and autoimmune diseases, as well as cancers.\nAdvertisement\n“It became clear we could update the science behind therapeutics in this area and radically change the benefit-to-risk ratio,” said Third Rock partner Alexis Borisy.\nAtlas and Third Rock together will own the majority of Magenta’s stock, but other investors include Google Ventures; Access Industries; and the Partners Innovation Fund, an affiliate of the Partners HealthCare network.\nGardner said he views Magenta as a “platform” company with the potential to generate multiple drugs targeting a wide range of diseases. He said it will seek to strike research partnerships with other drug companies, including gene therapy and gene editing companies that might use stem cell transplants in their own procedures.\nRobert Weisman can be reached at robert.weisman@globe.com .

      "text": "Microsoft and Google bury the hatchet in one small way Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help shape Microsoft's programming framework More like this Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft, speaking at the Build conference in San Francisco on March 30, 2016. Credit: Microsoft/IDGNS Email a friend   8:02   \nThere's no love lost between Google and Microsoft. The two companies have been fiercely competitive with one another in the public cloud, productivity and operating system markets. \nBut now there's one small glimmer of hope in the relationship between the two companies: Google has joined the .NET Foundation, to help drive forward the programming language framework Microsoft originated. \nGoogle will be a part of the technical steering group for the foundation, which helps guide the future of the platform and consults on changes to the .NET roadmap and project release schedule. The foundation oversees projects including .NET Core and the Roslyn .NET compiler. \nGoogle's fellow technical steering group members include Red Hat, Unity and Samsung, which announced Wednesday that developers will be able to use .NET Core to develop for its Tizen operating system. \nThe group is a set of somewhat strange bedfellows for Microsoft, but could help the company keep .NET and the C# programming language relevant in a broader set of circumstances. \nWednesday's news comes a few months after Microsoft made .NET Core generally available for use on Linux and macOS. Before the creation of the Foundation, the programming framework was more locked to Microsoft-controlled platforms like Windows. \nJulia Liuson, Microsoft's corporate vice president for Visual Studio, said at a press briefing that Google has a team dedicated to making sure that its public cloud platform is compatible with .NET. This partnership seems like a way for each of the companies to gain something from one another. \nThat's how IDC Program Director Al Hilwa saw it. He said in an email that the move could be emblematic of an improving relationship between Microsoft and Google. \n\"I think this is a mark of improving relationships between the two giants as the two have what each other craves,\" he said in an email. \"Microsoft is highly motivated to win startups and other emerging workloads, which Google technologies like Kubernetes have a lot of traction in, while Google is trying to build its enterprise business, something Microsoft has a lot of traction in.\" \nIt’s unclear, however, if the partnership will lead to an easing of relations between the two companies in other areas. Windows users, for example, have been clamoring for a YouTube app, something that Google has been unwilling to provide. \nThis partnership is part of a suite of announcements Microsoft made at its Connect conference in New York on Wednesday. The tech giant also announced that it will join the Linux Foundation as a platinum member, along with a host of product updates. RELATED TOPICS",

      "text": " Google+\nGetty Images\nA polling place in Panora, Iowa, on election day earlier this month.\nBy Samantha Schmidt The Washington Post November 16, 2016\nIn the days following the election, university campuses across the country erupted in rallies and marches. College counselors offered ‘‘healing spaces’’ and meditation sessions to help students cope with postelection trauma. Some professors even canceled classes or allowed students to opt out of tests.\nOne lawmaker in Iowa says he finds this ‘‘whole hysteria to be incredibly annoying.’’\nAdvertisement\nBobby Kaufmann, a Republican, plans to introduce a bill that echoes the eye-rolling frustration expressed by many who think colleges are ‘‘coddling’’ their students, or so-called ‘‘snowflakes.’’\nHe’s referring to the piece of legislation as the ‘‘suck it up, buttercup bill,’’ and he hopes to introduce it when the legislature resumes in January, the Des Moines Register reported.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The bill would take aim at state universities that offer election-related sit-ins and grief counseling beyond the resources normally available to students. Those colleges that use taxpayer dollars to fund these extra programs would be subject to a budget cut for double the amount they spend.\nKaufmann said he had heard of four or five schools in other states that were staffing grief counselors in zones where ‘‘kids can come cry out their sensitivity.’’\n‘‘People have the right to be hysterical,’’ Kaufmann said. ‘‘On their own time.’’\nAdvertisement\nThe legislation would also create new criminal penalties for protesters who shut down highways, Kaufmann told the Des Moines Register.\nKaufmann, who is serving in his second term in the Iowa House, is a crop and livestock farmer who works on his family’s eight-generation farm. He lives in Milton, Iowa, a town about an hour southeast of Cedar Rapids. He operates a steel-hauling, construction and demolition business, and is a member of the Farm Bureau and National Rifle Association, among other groups, according to a biography on the Iowa House Republicans website.\nA number of public colleges in Iowa held events to help students discuss and deal with the election results. But at least three of those - Iowa State University, the University of Iowa and the University of Northern Iowa - confirmed they are not spending any additional state resources to run the programs, the Des Moines Register reported.\n‘‘I think universities are the perfect place to have these types of conversations,’’ said Scott Ketelsen, director of university relations at the University of Northern Iowa. ‘‘It’s where people learn. It’s where they share ideas. I don’t consider it coddling.’’\nThe Iowa lawmaker’s idea for the bill received mixed reactions on Twitter: YES! Lawmaker drops the HAMMER on colleges coddling election crybabies…\n@desmoinesdem Politics aside, how sad and just plain mean.\n---\nOn Tuesday, a day after the Des Moines Register reported on Kaufmann’s plans, the University of Iowa took to Twitter to encourage students to call counseling services if they were seeking any sort of help: We are a caring community that values compassion, inclusion, respect, and dignity. #uiowa\nKaufmann’s plans followed a debate over the extent to which college campuses should provide additional resources - or exemptions - to help students cope with what some see as emotional postelection trauma.\nAt the University of Michigan Flint, students were informed of counseling services in three separate emails over a span of five hours. At the University of California San Diego, a three-hour ‘‘Talk It Out’’ event gave students the opportunity to hash out their feelings with a doctor with Counseling and Psychological Services, the College Fix reported.\nAnd a note posted on Facebook and Twitter the morning after the election by Purdue University’s student government president incited a slew of negative comments. The Purdue Student Gov account tweeted a template note that ‘‘grieving’’ students could send to a professor to request an extension, cancellation or excused absence for that day’s assignment.\n‘‘This is an instance in which I feel I need to take time for myself to heal after what was a traumatic evening last night,’’ the note template wrote. The president later apologized.\nA sophomore at Duke University posted a similar draft email in the All Duke Facebook page.\nResponses to the note from Purdue’s Student Government called it ‘‘intensely pathetic’’ and told students to ‘‘grow up.’’\n‘‘Poor little snowflakes. Run to your safespaces. Life didn’t go your way,’’ one comment wrote.\nIn light of this dialogue, and of an article in The Washington Post about postelection shock among Yale University students, one economics professor at Yale retorted that his students ‘‘don’t melt.’’\nThe professor, Steven Berry said the day after the election, he allowed his students to choose to opt out of the second midterm for personal reasons and transfer the weight of the exam entirely onto the final exam. While some of his students did email him expressing fear of personal consequences as a result of the election, almost all of the students showed up for the test the following day.\n‘‘It was hard and most students took the full 75 minutes,’’ Berry wrote. ‘‘No crying, no whining, no excuses.’’\nThe Iowa lawmaker also criticized some of the protests and rallies that took place across the state and country in the days after the election. He called out protesters who closed Interstate Highway 80 in Iowa City during a rally against President-elect Donald Trump last week.\nKaufmann said he plans to establish a law enforcement task force to consider options on how to address the issue and create tougher criminal penalties for those who disturb traffic. Officers now could potentially charge protesters with certain violations, but Kaufmann said many have told him they’d like clarity on the issue, the Des Moines Register reported.\n‘‘I have no issue with protesting,’’ he said. ‘‘In fact, I would go to political war for anyone who wanted to protest or dissent and they couldn’t. But you can’t exercise your constitutional right by trampling on someone else’s.’’",

      "text": " Google+\nIlya S. Savenok/Getty Images for The New Yorker\nCongressman Keith Ellison of Minnesota.\nBy John Wagner The Washington Post November 16, 2016\nWASHINGTON — Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on Wednesday endorsed the bid of Rep. Keith Ellison, D-Minn., to become the next chairman of the Democratic National Committee, adding to the congressman’s early momentum in the race to lead the party.\nIn a statement, Warren praised Ellison’s work in Congress ‘‘try to hold Wall Street accountable’’ and praised his leadership as a co-chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\nAdvertisement\n“I admire Keith’s values, his grit, and his dedication to making this country work not just for some of our kids but for all of them,’’ Warren said in a statement.\nMeanwhile, former Maryland governor Martin O’Malley took himself out of the running for the post Wednesday after announcing five days ago that he was taking a ‘‘hard look’’ at it.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here ‘‘While I’m grateful to the friends who have urged me to consider running for DNC Chair, I will not be seeking our Party’s Chairmanship,’’ O’Malley said in a statement.\nEllison and O’Malley, who ended a 2016 presidential bid following a poor showing in the Iowa caucuses, are among several people who have publicly expressed interest in the job since Hillary Clinton’s stunning defeat to President-elect Donald Trump last week.\nOthers eyeing the job include former Vermont governor Howard Dean, South Carolina Democratic Party Chairman Jaime Harrison and the DNC’s national finance chairman Henry Muñoz III.\nAdvertisement\nThe candidacy of Ellison, D-Minn., who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders, Vt., over Clinton in the Democratic primaries, has generated the most buzz.\nWarren’s support adds to a list of liberal lawmakers, including Sanders, who have coalesced around Ellison. He has also picked up the support of several others in the party’s establishment, including outgoing Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., and Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., his likely successor.\nThe next chairman is scheduled to be picked early next year by DNC members across the country, who may or may not take their cue from elected officials. The party’s bylaws call for a chairman to be chosen by March 1 to succeed interim chairwoman Donna Brazile, a longtime Democratic operative who stepped in after Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, Fla., announced her resignation in July.\nRelated Democrats shake up Senate leadership N.H. Democratic chair exploring run for DNC chief",

      "text": " Google+\nJonathan Wiggs/Globe staff/file 2016\nWho could be on the ballot for 2020?\nBy James Pindell Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nNow that the 2016 presidential election is on the books, it’s time for the next one — 2020.\nSure, after an especially divisive and vitriolic election, many Americans are looking for a break from politics. But for the ambitious, as well as those aggrieved by last week’s results, the next presidential election is only 206 weeks away.\nAdvertisement\nIt’s only a matter of time before some potential candidates stick out their heads to evaluate the competition — and not just Democrats, either. President-elect Donald J. Trump may have to fend off potential primary challengers, and no president in modern times who has been seriously challenged in a primary has ever won re-election.\nThe Globe has whittled down the crop of potential contenders, Democrats and Republicans, to 20 candidates who could run for president in 2020. Full disclosure: Any such list, including this one, is highly speculative at this point in the election cycle.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Here is that list, sorted by party and then by alphabetical order:\nDemocrats John Bel Edwards . If Democrats believe they need the “bubba vote” — a.k.a. white working class men — they could look to Edwards, who was elected last year as Louisiana’s governor. Edwards does have two problems, however, with the party’s base: He does not support abortion rights, and he’s a Second Amendment advocate.\nEdwards would also run into the same bad timing that former governor Bobby Jindal faced: He would need to figure out how to seek re-election in Louisiana in 2019 and essentially run for president at the same time. Jindal passed on 2012 for this reason.\nAdvertisement\nBill de Blasio . The New York City mayor faces a 40 percent approval rating and, as a result, even odds of being re-elected next year. But should he win a second term, he could be the big-city progressive that the Democratic party is seeking.\nCory Booker. The US senator from New Jersey is no longer the new kid on the block, but he is currently the best chance for America to have it next black president. What’s more, Booker’s avid social media use rivals that of Trump — except the Democrat uses Twitter to communicate with his constituents in a way that doesn’t make donors squirm.\nSherrod Brown . The Ohio Senator is a beloved progressive who can win Ohio. His four statewide victories in the Buckeye State were just a few reasons he made Clinton’s short-list for VP. Another? He was a populist before most Democrats.\nJulian Castro . The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and former San Antonio mayor gained national attention when he was selected to give the keynote address at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. And now that he’s out of office again, why wouldn’t he run?\nAndrew Cuomo . It’s hard to name a New York governor who did not fancy himself a potential presidential candidate. But Cuomo appeared to be politically boxed out in 2016 with Clinton, a fellow New Yorker, running for a second time. Now he has a free shot if he wants it.\nRuss Feingold. The former US senator from Wisconsin has lost his last two races, which means he’s still a liberal firebrand with nothing left to lose. Should he run, it would not be unlike former US senator Rick Santorum’s bid in 2012. Santorum lost re-election to the Senate six years prior, but then he came back to win the Iowa caucuses. So why not?\nTulsi Gabbard . At the peak of the primary, the US representative from Hawaii resigned as vice-chairman of the DNC to endorse Sanders. Her candidacy might be welcomed by Sanders supporters who believed he would have done better in a general election than Clinton. She is also a combat veteran and the first Hindu member of Congress.\nKamala Harris. California’s attorney general became this week the second black woman ever elected to the Senate (Her mother immigrated from India, and her father is Jamaican-American). She comes in with a lot of expectations, and some progressives have labeled her “the next Obama.” But so far, it’s unclear whether she would aggressively run for president in her first term.\nTim Kaine . Clinton’s running mate will not inherit all of her organization, but the US senator from Virginia will have a head start over the competition. He also knows something about running a national campaign from his time as DNC chairman under Obama. But before he builds a national bid, Kaine will need to seek and win re-election in 2018.\nAmy Klobuchar. A former county prosecutor, the senator from Minnesota has already been a frequent guest in Iowa and New Hampshire.\nJoe Manchin . Manchin, currently a US senator from West Virginia, is a former governer as well. He’s now one of the few centrists in the Senate, which could be a problem for the Democratic Party’s left wing if he were to run. But Manchin has consistently won as a Democrat in a state full of white working class voters who have made a hard right turn over the last decade.\nThomas Perez . President Obama’s Secretary of Labor may be seeking to increase his national stature after this administration. He was once on the short list of Hillary Clinton’s vice presidential picks and has expressed interest in running for chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Most importantly, now that he’s out of office, he has nothing to lose by running for president in 2020 — and likely would only raise his profile in the process.\nBernie Sanders . Sanders raised more money from small donors that anyone ever to run for president. He also won 23 states in the Democratic primary — especially remarkable given he was running against Clinton and he wasn’t even a Democrat. The downside: Sanders will be 79 on Election Day four years from now.\nTom Steyer. The billionaire San Francisco environmentalist spent big money on his Super PAC in the 2014 and 2016 elections, and came up with no big points on the board. But during those cycles, he often acted like a candidate more than a donor, making enough public appearances that some in California believe he could run for governor in 2018 . Regardless, he could decide to make the leap in 2020 to ensure his top issue, climate change, gets covered.\nJon Tester . If any Democrat has the “bubba” persona, it’s Tester. The US senator hails from from Montana, where he still keeps his farm. But while his 2016 tenure as chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee probably bolstered his Rolodex of party donors, his record there did not: Democrats came up short of winning enough seats to take control of the Senate.\nElizabeth Warren . The US senator from Massachusetts has not even announced whether she would run for re-election in 2018 — much less disclose her plans for 2020. At the moment, Warren represents the populist soul of the Democratic Party. But four years from now? Someone else could be the shiny new object of the party’s dreams.\nTom Wolf . The Pennsylvanian doesn’t have the best approval rating (44 percent), but he does answer the question of how Democrats can win back the Keystone State.\nRepublicans John Kasich. The governor of Ohio was already gearing up to run again in 2020, working on the theory that Trump would lose this year. And if enough Republicans are unhappy with Trump in four years, Kasich could still run.\nTed Cruz. Cruz may be Trump’s greatest threat in a primary. He won more states than any other Trump rival this year, plus Cruz could run to the president’s right. If Trump senses a threat, however, he could remove Cruz by appointing him to the United States Supreme Court.\nJames Pindell can be reached at james.pindell@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Adam Vaccaro Globe Staff November 16, 2016\nWATCH Tom Brady express his feelings on unfair punishments in our new #WeekofGreatness spot! pic.twitter.com/dtwT41AGNJ\n— Foot Locker (@footlocker) November 16, 2016 Is Tom Brady ready to make light of Deflategate?\nIn a new advertisement for sports apparel chain Foot Locker, the New England Patriots quarterback sure seems to be riffing on the football air pressure scandal that gripped NFL fans, scientists, and legal scholars over the last two years. Ultimately, the saga resulted in a four-game suspension for Brady.\nAdvertisement\nThe 30-second spot doesn’t directly mention Deflategate. But the reference is hard to overlook.\nWhen two Foot Locker customers enter a diner and wonder aloud how the company’s shoes keep “getting better even after all these years” and speculate about “what Foot Locker is up to,” Brady takes exception to the suggestion of impropriety.\nGet Business Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “Just because something’s great year after year doesn’t mean anything’s going on,” the 17-year veteran says. “Why can’t some things just be great?”\nBrady goes on to make what seems like a glib reference to his suspension: “It starts with questions and then questions turn into assumptions, and then assumptions turn into vacations.”\nThe ad is part of Foot Locker’s annual “Week of Greatness” campaign, when it releases new shoes ahead of the holiday shopping season.\nAdvertisement\nBrady was active on the endorsement scene during his suspension at the start of the season. He also starred in an ad for Shields MRI , a more regional spot that advertising specialists said was out of the ordinary for the high-profile star.\nYou can watch the ad below:\nAdam Vaccaro can be reached at adam.vaccaro@globe.com .

This was a typically false news story.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 President-elect Trump also criticized the Times over its coverage of his transition:\nThe failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition. It is going so smoothly. Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said. Russia, U.K., China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 Australia, New Zealand, and more. I am always available to them. @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me.\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 16, 2016 Advertisement\nTrump has previously threatened to “open up our libel laws” to make it easier to sue news organizations.\nThe comments about the press reports come after Trump broke protocol again when he went out to dinner without the press corps . He had broken a long-standing practice last week in refusing to allow a group of journalists to travel with him when he met with President Barack Obama at the White House.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up!

Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair!\n— Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) November 11, 2016 His former campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told the “Today” show Tuesday she was “not intimately aware” that such a move was underway.\nReports emerged late Monday that Trump’s transition team was looking into security clearances for his three older children, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump, and Ivanka Trump, as well as his son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\nAdvertisement\nHe and his surrogates have said the children would be in charge of running his businesses while he was president.\nRelated 20 candidates who could run in 2020 With imminent GOP takeover, lobbyists see an opening Ousters, turmoil in Donald Trump’s transition team ‘We’re going to stand together,’ Bernie Sanders vows Warren wants Trump to shake up his transition team — or else",

Trump has said he will halt federal funding to sanctuary cities such as Somerville, Chelsea, and Boston, which shield illegal immigrants from possible deportation.\nWithout discussing the issue of sanctuary cities directly, Baker said he believes “the way local communities choose to ensure harmony and public safety in their own communities should be up to them.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “People choose a variety of ways to engage in that, and I support that, but my job as the governor is to advocate for the Commonwealth of Mass., and that means everybody in the Commonwealth of Mass.,” said Baker.\nThe governor pledged to work with the state’s congressional delegation to represent the interests of Massachusetts communities.\n“We have always been a welcoming state and being a welcoming state is what has made us strong and successful,” he said.

      "text": "Later is a simpler replacement for Apple’s reminders Posted Google   \nIf you tend to turn to email to send yourself short reminders, instead of using a more feature rich to do list or task management application, a new app called Later wants to help. Later aims to offer an alternative to Apple’s sometimes cumbersome Reminders by giving you an easier, faster way to set times to be reminded about upcoming tasks, as well as way to get alerts when you return to your Mac. \nThe idea for the application comes from three friends based in Latvia: Gustavs Cirulis, a designer at Intercom; Andris Fedotovs, an iOS engineer; and Davis Siksnans, the CEO and co-founder of Printful. The three had previously built other apps, including screenshot organizer Inboard , and a Mac utility called Characters . \nAccording to Siksnans, the team also often turned to email as their go-to reminders application of choice, and had grown frustrated. \n“We got tired of sending emails to ourselves to remind of mundane things,” he says. “Alternative apps like Apple’s iCal or Reminders took too many taps to input a simple reminder. We thought there’s got to be a better app.” \nThe end result is Later, which is available both on iOS and Mac. While you can use the apps individually, they’re more powerful when combined. \nThere isn’t an extensive feature list for Later, and that’s by design. \nThe app is very straightforward to use. Upon first launch, you’re presented with a blank page and flashing cursor. Here, you just type in whatever it is you want to be reminded about, hit the checkmark, and you’re then taken to a second screen where you pick a time. \nInstead of the date and time picker, which many of us find tedious to use, the screen offers a variety of time presets as buttons you just tap. For example, there are buttons for “3 Hours Later,” “This Evening,” “Tomorrow Morning,” “Next Week,” and so on. If you absolutely need to set a specific date, however, there’s an option for that, too. \nBut one of the app’s better features is the button that says “On My Mac.” What this means is that if you also have Later’s Mac app installed, you can trigger an alert when you return to your computer. Your reminders will sync between both platforms via iCloud, so you can enter in new items as they pop into your head, no matter if you’re at your desk or out-and-about. \nUnfortunately, you can’t set a Mac reminder to pop up the next time you unlock your phone because that’s not something Apple currently allows, Siksnans says, but the team is thinking about ways to work around that problem – for instance, by using motion tracking, perhaps. \nThe iOS app is free, but the Mac app to complete the solution is a $4.99 download. That’s a launch special discount though – the app will be $9.99 in the future. While the simplicity is what makes Later interesting, people may balk at the higher price point for such a no-frills application. \nThat being said, it’s always refreshing to see apps that understand how to best take advantage of mobile. On-the-go users don’t want to fill out sign-up forms, watch tutorials, or face a steep learning curve just to use what should be a basic utility. Later gets that, by taking you right to the experience. It takes only a few seconds to get going. In fact, the download of the app itself takes longer than creating your first reminder.",

Granted, I'm forcing my husband to use the app as our primary means of communication, but it's because I genuinely enjoy the variety of customization as we're typing messages back and forth.\n\nGoogle has updated Allo with more friendly functionality. There's now a feature called Smart Smiley that pops up relevant emojis as you're typing. Additionally, you can now choose from a variety of themes to spice up your chat windows.\nAllo has also added a new Fantastic Beasts sticker pack for those who are fans of J.K.

And if a pal sends over a sticker from a pack you don't currently have, you can tap on it in the chat window to download it and reciprocate the sentiment.\nThe new Allo features begin rolling out today for both Android and iOS devices.\nMore: Everything you need to know about Allo \n",

      "text": "Get ready to virtually fly around the brick-domed Florence cathedral in Italy and San Francisco's majestic Golden Gate Bridge.\nGoogle said Wednesday that a virtual reality version of Google Earth is now available to download for free via the Steam gaming distribution service. As of now, only HTC Vive virtual reality headset users will be able to use the app, but Google plans to make it compatible with other headsets in the future.\nIn a video demo of the VR app, a woman wearing a Vive headset is shown looking at a virtual representation of Tokyo skyscrapers while seemingly hovering in air in between the buildings. She is then shown flying through granite canyons in Yosemite National Park while using a touch controller to steer.\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter. \nUsing the touch controller, the woman can also summon a mini digital globe, and choose which countries and places she wants to virtually visit.\n\"Now, at 196.9 million square miles, we know the world is pretty big, so we've made it easy to find great places to visit,\" Google VR product manager Mike Podwal wrote in a blog post . \"Earth VR comes with cinematic tours and hand-picked destinations that send you to the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and more.”\nIt should be noted that this VR version of Google goog Earth requires some hefty computing power to run, much like other VR apps built for powerful VR headsets like the Vive or Facebook's fb Oculus Rift. These headsets require computers with high-end graphics cards, among other types of pricey hardware, to operate.\nAccording to CNET , Google may eventually release a version of the app that can run on its new Daydream View VR headset that costs $79. But because that headset is powered by mobile phone, it's likely to not be as graphically-rich or as compelling as the current version that relies on a personal computer.\nAlthough Google spent a lot of time creating 3-D representations popular tourist attractions like Seattle’s Space Needle and the Colosseum in Rome, the CNET article says that there remains a lot of imagery that hasn’t been modified for VR. For example, Windsor Castle in England and Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, are only rendered in 2-dimensions, similar to the standard Google Earth app.\nFor more about Google, watch: \n\nBut it's likely that Google will add more 3-D renderings of different places over time to improve the app.",

      "text": "- Source: Google Blog \nRecently, Google announced that it achieved near-human accuracy for translating to and from English, Spanish, and Chinese. The company is using a new neural network training technique, which it calls the Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system. Google announced today that it has started using its new system for nine languages (eight pairs) and that it will soon use it for all of Google Translate’s 103 supported languages. Understanding Full Sentences \nThe main difference between Google’s previous ten-year-old Phase-Based Machine Translation system and the new Neural Machine Translation system is that it analyzes the sentence as a whole, rather than as the sum of its parts. \nThis adjustment means that Google’s new system can better understand the whole meaning of a sentence rather than just the meaning of a few words at a time, which it would then have to combine into a full sentence with less accurate results. Because it uses neural networks, the new system can also learn over time to create better and more natural translations. A Big Leap In Machine Translation \nStarting today, Google is enabling its Neural Machine Translation engine for eight language pairs. Google Translate users will be able to translate to and from English and French, German, Spanish, Portuguese, Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Turkish. According to Google, these language pairs represent the native language of a third of the world’s population, which covers more than 35% of Google Translate queries. \nThe company also noted that the progress it has made in translation accuracy with the new Neural Machine Translation system is bigger than what it achieved in the past ten years combined with the old phase-based system. Google will enable the new NMT system for the eight language pairs in the Google Translate app, the website , and Google Search. The company’s goal is to eventually enable the system for 103 languages. \nGoogle also announced that its Google Cloud Platform service would begin to offer a translation API that also uses the new system.

      "text": "I’ve you’ve ever tried to digitize your old, printed photos then you know how much of a hassle it can be without access to a high resolution scanner. Since many people don’t have a great scanner to handle digitizing photographs, they rely on their smartphone cameras. However, the glare and alignment difficulties often results in a sub-optimal version of your original photograph.\nThis is where Google’s new app, PhotoScan, comes into play. It’s a free application that is available right now on the Play Store. When you launch it, you’re asked to align a photograph within a fixed rectangular frame, forcing the user to snap a picture of the photo at an appropriate angle and distance. After you take the first picture, you’ll then be asked to move the camera over four different white dots while the app continues to capture more images. When you capture photos from all four spots, PhotoScan then runs a custom algorithm designed by Google to combine the photos based on landmarks and eliminate any glare.\n\nNat and Lo from Google take us behind the scenes to give us a look how PhotoScan works. The app uses computational photography to manipulate exactly what is being produced. PhotoScan removes the lighting glare by having you move the camera to each of those four dots. It will then map out some feature points (a single photo can have between 500 to 4,000 feature points) so the application can match those points from the images it captured.\nI was playing with the application last night and it really does make it easier to digitize your old photographs. Oddly enough, Google Play says the application is not compatible with the Pixel XL or the Nexus 6P that I own. It’s likely that Google is slowly rolling out the app to a limited number of devices at a time, but you can grab the APK for it right here .\nSource: Google \n",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Google Earth For Virtual Reality Lets You Fly Like Superman \nGet ready to virtually fly around the brick-domed Florence cathedral in Italy and San Francisco’s majestic Golden Gate Bridge. \nGoogle said Wednesday that a virtual reality version of Google Earth is now available to download for free via the Steam gaming distribution service. As of now, only HTC Vive virtual reality headset users will be able to use the app, but Google plans to make it compatible with other headsets in the future. In a video demo of the VR app, a woman wearing a Vive headset is shown looking at a virtual representation of Tokyo skyscrapers while seemingly hovering in air in between the buildings. She is then shown flying through granite canyons in Yosemite National Park while using a touch controller to steer. Get Data Sheet , Fortune’s technology newsletter. \nUsing the touch controller, the woman can also summon a mini digital globe, and choose which countries and places she wants to virtually visit. \n“Now, at 196.9 million square miles, we know the world is pretty big, so we’ve made it easy to find great places to visit,” Google VR product manager Mike Podwal wrote in a blog post . “Earth VR comes with cinematic tours and hand-picked destinations that send you to the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and more.” \nIt should be noted that this VR version of Google goog Earth requires some hefty computing power to run, much like other VR apps built for powerful VR headsets like the Vive or Facebook’s fb Oculus Rift. These headsets require computers with high-end graphics cards, among other types of pricey hardware, to operate. \nAccording to CNET , Google may eventually release a version of the app that can run on its new Daydream View VR headset that costs $79. But because that headset is powered by mobile phone, it’s likely to not be as graphically-rich or as compelling as the current version that relies on a personal computer. \nAlthough Google spent a lot of time creating 3-D representations popular tourist attractions like Seattle’s Space Needle and the Colosseum in Rome, the CNET article says that there remains a lot of imagery that hasn’t been modified for VR. For example, Windsor Castle in England and Manila, the capital city of the Philippines, are only rendered in 2-dimensions, similar to the standard Google Earth app. For more about Google, watch: \nBut it’s likely that Google will add more 3-D renderings of different places over time to improve the app. ",

      "text": "100% FREE report malware 9 screenshots Fast and user-friendly web browser designed to help you navigate the Internet while also allowing you to stay safe and synchronize your websites and bookmarks between multiple computers by signing in into your Google account The notions of internet and web browser are so locked together that some people consider the two equivalent. Everyone has its favorite web browser, but few of the popular choices have had such a spectacular development as Google Chrome. Google Chrome provides all the basic web browsing tools, a tabbed interface, support for extensions, records your history, allows you to save bookmarks and so on. On the other hand, it is also designed to take you deeper in the Google universe in order to provide a better browsing experience. At install, you are invited to make Google Chrome your default browser and you can also choose to send usage statistics and crash to help Google improve the application, which is nothing out of the ordinary. The novelty is represented by the first page opened in the bowser: you can log in to your Google account to get your bookmarks, history and settings on all your devices. Moreover, Google Chrome comes with the Google Docs extension already installed and enabled. This way you can choose to create and edit documents within your browser. Google Chrome also has a different perspective on using additional windows for accessing different tools: the respective areas are opened in the browser window, as different tabs. The rule applies to the Bookmarks Manager and to the Settings area. In fact, the History, the Extensions and the Settings panels are all contained in a single tab. This can be extremely useful, since all tools and features are all in the same place. Setting up and using the browser is very straightforward and, if you encounter any issue, the online Help area should clarify every situation. Additionally, Google Chrome allows you to customize its interface by installing different themes via the Chrome Web Store. The same location provides Google Chrome extensions that can improve your workflow and more. Google Chrome is one of the most popular web browsers out there and, since it comes bundled with different Google products, can prove to be quite efficient.

NASA discovers mysterious electron superhighway above Earth World Miriam Kramer / 21 minutes ago Earth and the space that surrounds it. Image: NASA \nSome electrons are speeding above Earth's surface at nearly the speed of light, and NASA isn't sure why. \nAccording to a new study, the tiny, charged particles were found accelerating to high speeds in an unexpected part of space, farther from Earth than previously realized. \nThe region these fast electrons were found in, known as the foreshock, is the part of the solar system where charged particles streaming from the sun are thought to be reflected back from Earth's magnetic field toward the star. SEE ALSO: NASA is firing lasers on Mars — here’s why \nUntil now, however, scientists didn't think the region could speed up particles to the degree that was observed \n“This is a puzzling case because we’re seeing energetic electrons where we don’t think they should be, and no model fits them,” David Sibeck, a co-author of the new study published in the journal Physical Review Letters said in a statement . \n“There is a gap in our knowledge, something basic is missing,” Sibeck said. The study evaluated data from a NASA program known as THEMIS — a mission involving five identical space probes tasked with studying Earth’s auroras and the radiation environment around our planet. Human space travel implications \nCharged particles streaming from the sun out into the rest of the solar system can harm satellites in orbit and even people living in space. That radiation needs to be understood in order to guard against its worst effects. \n“This affects pretty much every field that deals with high-energy particles, from studies of cosmic rays to solar flares and coronal mass ejections, which have the potential to damage satellites and affect astronauts on expeditions to Mars,” Lynn Wilson, another author of the study, said in the statement. \nCharged particles speeding toward Earth from the sun encounter an area of space called the \"bow shock.\" That region is something like a protective zone that helps shield our planet from the solar wind. \nAn annotated version of the Earth and its surrounding area. \nImage: NASA \nThe bow shock has a magnetic field within it, which slows high-energy particles down, according to NASA. Most of those particles are diverted away from Earth, but some do bounce back toward the sun, creating the foreshock region, where the electron superhighway was discovered. \nBefore this new research, scientists knew that electrons in the foreshock could move quickly. Researchers have suggested that the particles speed up when they move across the bow shock multiple times, NASA said. \nBut the new study has added to NASA's understanding of how these electrons accelerate. \nIt seems as though some kind of electromagnetic activity in the foreshock itself might be accelerating the particles to unexpected speeds, the study suggests.

      "text": "New Google Flights Tool Tells When Airfare Prices May Change 59 minutes ago Google aims to make booking flights easier with a new search tool, Google Flights. Share 64 kbps Pop-out player \nThe cost of airplane flights is often the biggest expense of travel. Airfares can be expensive and budgeting for them can be difficult. Prices change often so it is not easy to know which flight is best. And there can be extra charges for baggage. \nThe process is even more complex for family travel. \nNow, the online search service Google Flights has a new tool to help you find the best airfares and plan your next trip. The service can let you know when the price for a flight is going to end. It can alert you when prices are expected to rise. Google Flights now compares airfares to historical price data for similar flights. \nUsing Google Flight's New Tool \nTo use this new tool, go to the Google Flights website . \nYou can search for flights by date, airports, number of stops, flight class and number of passengers. Google Flights will highlight in green the flights it thinks are the best choices, based on price, flight times and number of stops. \nAfter you choose a flight, you may also see a note about when the price is set to end. Google Flights may also suggest you book as soon if prices are expected to rise soon. Google Flights Price Increase \nThis tool only works when a flight’s historical data is available. The information may be able to show you how much time you have to book a flight before the price changes. \nTrack Prices \nSearch results include a “Track Prices” option. You can turn on to receive emails about price changes and travel tips. Google Flights lets you choose Track Prices even if you have not yet purchased your tickets nor chosen a flight. Google Flights Track Prices \nYou can manage your tracked flights and change the search fields, such as number of passengers, airports, dates and more. \nGoogle Flights will e-mail you if there is a considerable change in airfares for your saved flights. Google Flights Email \nComparing Airfares \nGoogle Flights also has other tools to help you compare airfares. It provides a calendar with flight prices listed every day. You can see flight prices listed by date so you can choose an economical time to fly. Google Flights Calendar \nYou can also see airfares on a bar graph to compare prices easily. Google Flights Bar Graph \nGoogle Flights also shows airfares on a map to help you decide where to go. Google Flights Map View \nYou may see a tip at the top of the results, advising that you could save money by flying on a different date or from a nearby airport. Google Flights Tip \nI’m Caty Weaver. \nCarolyn Nicander Mohr wrote this report for VOA Learning English. Caty Weaver was the editor. \nDo you try to find the best prices for airfares? Would you sign up to get notices about price changes? Are you interested in finding out when an airfare will end? \nShare your thoughts in the Comments Section below or on our Facebook page .",

REUTERS/Brendan McDermid 5331534 \nEric Schmidt, executive chairman of Google’s parent company Alphabet Inc., was photographed wearing a badge identifying himself as a member of Hillary Clinton’s “staff” during her Election Night party last week. Eric Schmidt wore “Staff” Badge at Clinton Election Night Party https://t.co/UEcDfjBNAg pic.twitter.com/SkiBpHDr5v \n— LeslieP (@less_tx) November 16, 2016 \nThe photo of Schmidt was originally reported by Politico, and was sent in by a reader. Schmidt’s cozy relationship with the Clinton campaign has been revealed over the past year. The Clinton campaign paid hundreds of thousands to a start-up data company backed by Schmidt. \nSeveral emails released by WikiLeaks and a memo also showed that Schmidt wanted to be Clinton’s “head outside advisor,” gave John Podesta advice on where to put the campaign headquarters, and that he worked directly with the campaign to set up several back-end features to their site. \nThe Daily Caller has reached out to Google to ask why was Schmidt wearing the staff badge. The tech giant has not responded. \nIt also seems that Google has cozied up now with the Trump campaign following Clinton’s loss. A source told Politico that Joshua Wright has been advising the Trump campaign regarding issues related to the Federal Trade Commission. Wright has previously written papers funded by Google that push their interests.",

Watch mid-2000s Disney Channel stars get super irritated in uncut promo footage Watercooler 356 shares Laura Vitto / 1 hour ago \nDespite the cheery tone of those 10-second \" You're watching Disney Channel \" promos from the mid-2000s, the raw footage is anything but. \nRemove the careful editing and all that's left is an irritated teen actor waving around a neon-green stick. Truly, these videos are a gift. Hilary Duff \n— madison (@toulousevevo) November 15, 2016 \nGeorgia-based edit boutique Guillotine Post is responsible for the uncut Disney star footage currently floating around Twitter. The company shared the videos on YouTube in September, along with a huge catalog of other Disney promo clips it worked on from the early to mid-2000s. The videos have since been removed, but luckily, Twitter users kept them in circulation. SEE ALSO: Raven-Symoné is leaving 'The View' for a reason that's so Raven \nGuillotine Post — who regularly edited promos for Disney Channel — offered background on how these TV bumps came together: \nFirst the talent was shot on a set with just a white background. They were told to make motions that might look like they were drawing mouse ears in the corner of the screen. They really didn't know exactly how it was going to look so they were pretty much winging it. \n... \nKeep in mind that behind lots of great television there is a lot of boring, awkward stuff that hits the cutting room floor. All you need is a few seconds that have the right energy and you have what you need for the promo. This footage was never meant to be viewed as it is. We just thought people might learn more about what goes on behind the scenes when making TV promos. \nInformative and entertaining.",

      "text": "Pixel, Phone by Google. Enjoy your favorite content, ad-free. Pixel, Phone by Google.Enjoy your favorite content, ad-free. Millennials wearing Snapchat Spectacles could be a privacy disaster Tech Sasha Lekach / 1 hour ago Snapchat Spectacles have arrived. Image: lili sams/mashable \nThe new Snapchat Spectacles might look like a toy, but connected sunglasses may carry hidden security implications. \nSnap Inc. — the company behind the disappearing message app Snapchat — unveiled its newest product, Spectacles , on Thursday. The sunglasses-turned-video-camera lets you capture quick 10-second scenes that immediately get sent to your Snapchat account on your phone (making them public is another step). SEE ALSO: Of course you have to buy Snapchat's Spectacles from a robot \nWith bold, bright colors and blinking lights to indicate recording, the device feels more like a toy than a serious piece of technology, which only adds to the appeal for its user base. Snapchat says its app reaches a whopping 41 percent of all 18- to 34-year-olds in the United States. Now, users of the app can attach internet-enabled cameras to their faces that capture everything in their field of vision. \nThe problem? The product could make it much easier to record personal information and invade another person's privacy without them even realizing it. Spectacles are probably a privacy disaster. No one cares. They look cool. \nGranted, Spectacles are built to be fairly obvious — they're brightly colored and have big cameras on them. They also, like most sunglasses, will generally be worn outside, where an expectation of privacy is not as relevant as, say, a restroom. \nStill, noted tech blogger David Papp, users can still wear them in inappropriate situations. \n\"The possibility does exist that people will use them in inappropriate ways. Embarrassing clips could go viral. If users wear them in public washrooms or capture stealth videos of careless remarks, there is the possibility of abuse,\" he wrote. \nSnapchat Spectacles \nImage: snapchat \nSome younger millennials and people living outside the Silicon Valley bubble might not remember the rise of \"Glassholes,\" the annoying people who wore Google's failed wearables project , Glass, to record every mundane interaction. \nSome of the security concerns that plagued Google Glass, including the collection of personal data, are still relevant to Spectacles, even though they can't continuously record video. So many pieces on Google Glass were about or at least mentioned privacy concerns. Conversely, Snap’s “Spectacles” coverage is cool; neat! \n— Aaron Landry (@s4xton) September 24, 2016 \nWearables security expert Matthew Ferrante, CEO of Aurora Security and CSO of Security Optics, told Mashable companies such as Snap offer an easy way to capture video but users don't think about the metadata — including location, facial and voice recognition data — that is really captured. \n\"People are just giving their information out,\" Ferrante said, in regards to Snapchat. \"Can it be abused? Absolutely.\" \nAnother key difference between Spectacles and Glass is the accessibility to a younger demographic. \nGlass, at around $1,500, was marketed as a serious tech purchase and therefore the wearable wasn't snapped up by the Snapchat generation. The $130 Spectacles are much more affordable. The possibility of Spectacles ending up in the hands of millions of young consumers is much more real. \nWith Spectacles' low price point also comes a likely compromise in privacy and security, according to Ferrante. He believes users should be willing to spend more on technology to ensure better security of their information. “People are putting their own digital fingerprints out there,\" he said. \n“People are putting their own digital fingerprints out there.\" \nKaren Monahan, a spokesperson for Darkness to Light , an organization that works to prevent child sexual abuse but also tracks digital safety, believes another issue for concern is users not realizing how public and permanent their social media content really is. \nShe told Mashable at first glance the Spectacles \"seem risky\" due to geo-location tracking data and the high potential for people to be recorded without their knowledge. \"Personal choice is not there,\" she said. \"That's a concern.\" \nSpectacles are as risky as any other new technology, though, including the sunglasses' parent app, Snapchat, Monahan said. Even if you are just using your phone's camera to record your surroundings, the videos are still connected to your account and identity. \nSnap declined to comment to Mashable for this article, but directed users to its community guidelines page. \nThe privacy page on its site, which includes a section devoted to the new glasses, states that many of the same guidelines for using the Snapchat app on your phone apply for Spectacles. \n\"Our Community Guidelines have always said to be thoughtful and respect people’s privacy, and these ideals apply equally when you’re using Spectacles,\" the privacy page reads. \"Please be respectful and considerate of others.\" \nOne thing is certain, Spectacle users don't want to earn a lovely moniker like Google Glass users had to deal with: So think twice about what you film and don't be a Spectacle-hole.",

      "text": "Markets Today Nvidia's Deals with IBM, Microsoft and Google Strengthen Its Artificial Intelligence Lead Though competition abounds, Nvida's GPU investments and software ecosystem are big advantages in a booming market for powering AI tasks. Eric Jhonsa Nov16,20165:35PMEST \nNvidia's ( NVDA ) spectacular earnings and guidance last week provided good evidence that the GPU leader is on its way to making the powering of artificial intelligence workloads a 10-figure annual business. \nSince then, it hasn't wasted time announcing moves that grow its AI ecosystem and could help keep hungry rivals at bay. \nOn Monday, Nvidia and IBM ( IBM ) announced the latter is rolling out a software toolkit called IBM PowerAI for IBM servers containing Nvidia's Tesla accelerator cards, which are widely used to handle a popular type of AI known as deep learning. \nIBM also rolled out a new server, the Power S822LC, that's optimized for AI and other high-performance computing (HPC) workloads: It pairs Big Blue's mammoth Power8 CPUs with Tesla accelerators and Nvidia's NVLink high-speed GPU interconnect. \nThat day, Nvidia also announced it's teaming with Microsoft ( MSFT ) on a solution that lets businesses create AI workloads by using Microsoft's Cognitive Toolkit software on systems containing Tesla GPUs. The solution is available both via Microsoft's Azure public cloud platform, and for corporate data centers through Nvidia's Tesla-powered DGX-1 HPC system. \nAnd on Tuesday, Nvidia and Microsoft disclosed Azure server virtual machines (VMs) that feature Tesla GPUs are now generally available to Azure cloud computing users, four months after launching in preview mode. This comes less than two months after Amazon ( AMZN ) unveiled cloud computing VMs that support up to 16 Tesla GPUs. Prev 0 of 3 Next If you liked this article you might like",

      "text": "Home > Virtual Reality > Google Earth VR lets you cruise the globe like… Google Earth VR lets you cruise the globe like Superman November 16, 2016 10:26 AM   \nVirtual reality has a number of interesting applications. The ability to create a virtual world and then allow users to explore and manipulate it in ways that would otherwise be impossible has value for education, engineering, medicine, and. of course, gaming. It’s no wonder, then, that VR remains one of the most exciting fields in computing today. \nWhen it comes to exploring the world, no application takes a more holistic view than Google Earth, which has long provided maybe the easiest way for anyone with an internet connection to fly around the globe and see almost anywhere that’s accessible to Google’s various resources. Therefore, it makes perfect sense that Google would make a Google Earth VR version, as has now been announced on the Steam community . \nMore: Google Earth Pro used to cost $400, here’s how to get it for free \nGoogle Earth VR comes a year after Google Earth itself celebrated its 10th anniversary. The app started out as a novelty but quickly evolved into something much more, and it is becoming the place where oddities like alleged UFOs and military bases were discovered. Google Earth has been used to discover long-lost civilizations and to identify illegal marijuana crops . Suffice it to say, the app has become a powerful way to visualize our planet, and bringing it to VR is a natural step in its storied evolution. \nFor now, Google Earth VR is launching on the HTC Vive, and it provides the ability to explore the same 196.9 million square miles as the 2D version of the app. The same cinematic tours are present, as are highlighted destinations to explore such as the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, and the Swiss Alps. \nGoogle Earth VR is free to play via Steam . While an HTC Vive is required for now, the app will support other VR platforms next year. The systems requirements for the game mimic those of VR systems in general, requiring a relatively hefty Windows 7 or later PC with at least an Intel Core i5-6500 processor equivalent or higher, 8GB of RAM, and at least an Nvidia GeForce GTX 970 or AMD Radeon R9 Fury.",

Google and Facebook have had decided it’s time to hit those sites where it hurts: in the wallet. \nBoth companies have decided that news sites pushing intentionally deceptive clickbait are no longer welcome on their advertising networks. \nGoogle is tweaking their AdSense policies to specify that sites they believe “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information” can and will be banned. Facebook made a similar tweak to their own policy, telling the Wall Street Journal that they will “vigorously enforce [their] policies and take swift action against sites and apps that are found to be in violation.” \nWhile that won’t make these sites disappear overnight, it’s certainly going to make an impact. There are plenty of alternative advertising networks out there that these shady publishes will no doubt turn to, but AdSense and Facebook will be tough to replace. \nAs welcome as it is to see Google and Facebook take a stand, some, like TechCrunch’s Romain Dillet , wonder if there isn’t a better way to deal with this particular plague. \nHow? Flagging fake news stories would be a heck of a good start, and you’d think with all the tweaks Google has managed to cook up for its search algorithms over the years that it wouldn’t be all that hard for them to pull off. \nFacebook, well… that might be a little tougher. Their robot news editors haven’t really been doing a great job since they took over for human curators. \nThen again, you and I can glance at an image like the one TechCrunch shared, note the use of “most epic” and “awesome move,” raise our eyebrows at the URL americannews.com and immediately discount this story as utter crap. You’d think it would be pretty easy to weed it out with software, too. Share",

      "text": "Videos \nGoogle has published numerous experiments with its cloud AI technologies, but 'Quick, Draw' is perhaps the most fun one yet. Using the same technology that interprets written symbols in Google Translate, the game attempts to guess what you are drawing. When you start, you are prompted to draw a specific thing, and the game continues making guesses until it wins or time runs out. \nAt the end of six rounds, it provides you with information about all your drawings, including other guesses and what other users provided. It learns from every drawing, so theoretically, it should become smarter over time. \nIt's very addicting, almost like Draw Something was back in the day. Except you can't cheat and just spell out the word. I bet some of you did that, didn't you? Source:",

      "text": "share We all have our own horror stories about rushing to find a public restroom, but in India, it’s more than just locating a toilet — it’s finding one that’s also clean enough to use. Roughly 70 percent of Indian households don’t have access to toilets, which results in a nationwide culture of open defecation and urination. To combat this issue, India’s Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) is partnering with Google to launch a toilet-locator tool on Google Maps to help people find access clean public restrooms, International Business Times India reports. The tool will launch first in the Delhi metropolitan area, and works like searching for nearby restaurants or banks on Google. Users can type in “toilet,” “lavatory,” or Hindi words like “swach” and “shulabh” to see the closest restrooms in the area. Results will include toilets located in malls, hospitals, and gas stations. MoUD and Google are relying heavily on users to help crowdsource data on whether a public toilet is clean, or notify them if the listed restroom is permanently closed. The pilot project is expected to go live in Delhi before the end of November, with no timeline on when it will expand to other cities. MoUD is hoping to first get feedback from users in the metro area before scaling up. In addition to access, critics are also calling for better education on sanitary toilet practices as the country continues to struggle with open defecation and water contamination. The MoUD / Google initiative appears to be pretty local to India — we’ve contacted Google for comment on future expansion and will update if we hear back. Next Up In Culture",

Image: youtube/Mackenzie rough \nAt the height of Spice Girls fever, the British band's \"girl power\" slogan was sometimes cast off as a shallow marketing tactic designed to sell CDs (remember them?) \nBut the musicians' message was real, and this new slice of spice proves it. The girls were captured on film back in 1997, berating a male crew member who demanded the band show more cleavage during an advertisement for Polaroid. \n\"Why did you ask that? To have our cleavage showing and our midriff showing,\" Melanie Brown asked the unnamed male crew member. \n\"It's every male's fantasy,\" the man replied. \"Well you can f*ck off,\" Brown fired back.

It's a glorious watch. \n\"You chauvinistic pig. That's such an easy cop out,\" Geri Halliwell angrily told the cocky man, as Victoria Beckham takes his sunglasses off his head and tries to sell them. \n\"At your age, you should know better by now. You're in advertising,\" Halliwell added, as the man nervously tries to defend what he said. \nAt the end of the video, Brown and Halliwell sarcastically congratulates the man who caused the commotion. \n\"And we especially thank you, because he's the one who said can you show a bit of cleavage and midriff. And we said no, girl power!\" Brown told the camera. \nBring back the '90s.",

      "text": "Google Earth VR Launched With Support for the HTC Vive Headset Google Earth now available in VR First launching on HTC Vive It's free on Steam \nWith Google Earth, you can virtually visit any part of the globe without having to travel there in real life. So, it was only natural that its services would one day be available on virtual reality platforms – and that’s now. \nGoogle announced on Wednesday that Google Earth VR is now a thing, starting with HTC Vive. This news is clearly for the dedicated VR fan, considering the Vive retails for $799 (about Rs. 54,000) and needs a powerful PC alongside. Support for other platforms will roll out over the next year. \n“At 196.9 million square miles, we know the world is pretty big, so we’ve made it easy to find great places to visit,” Google VR product manager Mike Podwal said in an official blog post . “Earth VR comes with cinematic tours and hand-picked destinations that send you to the Amazon River, the Manhattan skyline, the Grand Canyon, the Swiss Alps, and more.” \nGoogle also mentioned that Earth has been around for 10 years now, and has seen 2 billion downloads in that time. Earth VR would have been perfect for the recently launched Daydream View, which is lacking in content. It currently supports Google Street View and Google Arts & Culture. \nThat’s all there is to it. You can get Google Earth VR for free on Steam , assuming you’ve access to an HTC Vive. Expect to find some blurred places, considering the kind of requests Google gets now and then.",

      "text": "Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news 'news' Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news 'news' Commentary: The internet has a problem with fake news. Here's an easy fix. Maybe Facebook, Google just need to stop calling fake news 'news' 0 Share: Up Next Amazon offers peek at month of Black Friday deals \nIn the words of our 16th president, Abraham Lincoln, \"Half of what you read on the internet is not true.\" \nThat's the problem when you give billions of people access to a global forum where they can pretty much post whatever they want. You never know if what you're reading is true, which is why we choose sites we think offer legitimate news. Maybe you wonder if that story about a one-eyed baby has been fact checked, maybe you don't. You shouldn't have to, since we all expect what we read on our trusted news sites to actually be true. \nSo now we have Facebook and Google being called out for showcasing \"fake news\" stories . It's a big deal because nearly 45 percent of US adults say they rely on the world's largest social network and world's largest search engine for news , even though they're not traditional \"media\" companies. \nThat last part is important. Photo by John Greim, LightRocket via Getty Images \nMost media companies have some rules on fact checking. CNET's reporters and reviewers must verify information they're writing and then back that up by linking to original source material like company press releases, videos and websites. \nBut there are plenty of other sites that simply run content collected from across the internet and argue they don't need to check because they didn't write it. They're just content distributors. They're just aggregators. \nThat's certainly how Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg seemed to deflect Facebook's role in promoting and sharing fake news that critics say helped Donald Trump win the election. Like this one about the supposed murder-suicide of an FBI agent investigating Clinton's leaked emails (not true). Or the one claiming Pope Francis endorsed Trump (also not true). \nThe idea that Facebook could even sway the election is \"crazy,\" Zuckerberg argued because less than 1 percent of all the shared posts are fake . But the math doesn't add up. Given that 1.2 billion people use the social media site daily , about 12 million see at least one fake news story a day, Airbnb's director of research (and former Facebooker) points out in a post. Can you imagine if The New York Times or the Guardian made up 1 percent of their stories, he says. \nNo, I can't actually. Google admits it messed up with fake election story \nZuckerberg said Facebook isn't a media company, so it's really not its job to ferret out fake news. But Facebook does need to \"proceed very carefully\" in taking on a role where it's expected to identify \"truth.\" (Quotes around truth are his.) \n\"While some hoaxes can be completely debunked, a greater amount of content, including from mainstream sources, often gets the basic idea right but some details wrong or omitted. An even greater volume of stories express an opinion that many will disagree with and flag as incorrect even when factual,\" Zuckerberg said in a post on Saturday. \n\"I am confident we can find ways for our community to tell us what content is most meaningful, but I believe we must be extremely cautious about becoming arbiters of truth ourselves.\" \nEarlier this week, we learned Google had prominently placed a fake news story about election results in the search engine's widely read news section. Contrary to what you might have read on Google, Trump didn't win the popular vote -- at least not according to the latest official count. \nGoogle, which uses an algorithm to vet news sources, owned up to making a mistake . \"The goal of Search is to provide the most relevant and useful results for our users,\" a Google spokeswoman said Monday. \"We clearly didn't get it right, but we are continually working to improve our algorithms.\" \nMeanwhile, Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the BBC , \"There should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here.\" \nHe didn't say how. \nMedia and tech experts have offered up a few solutions for Facebook and Google over the past few days. They include everything from being more open about how their algorithms highlight stories (and potentially making it easier for bad actors to game the results) to tagging stories that have been called out as hoaxes. \nI have my own idea. \nHey, Facebook and Google, why don't you set up editorial boards with respected journalists reviewing your services and suggesting ways to improve them? All the mass layoffs in media mean it's a good time for talent acquisition. \nI also have an even simpler solution. How about Facebook and Google stop calling their news feeds \"news\"? Google could maybe rebrand \"Google News\" as \"Articles & Other Miscellany\" or \"Stories Lots of People Are Reading.\" \nAnd instead of News Feed, Facebook might call it \"Stuff from the Internet,\" \"What S/He Said,\" or \"Facebook's Believe It Or Not -- Your Choice.\" \nOr maybe just \"Stories That Won't Affect an Election.\" \nThe winking face emoji is optional. \nFacebook and Google can't ignore their role in distributing deliberately false information to millions of people. A group of Facebook employees has reportedly set up a task force to discuss ways to fight the problem. Both companies on Monday said they won't let fake news sites use their ad-selling software anymore. That sounds noble until you remember they're both ad-funded services and advertisers don't want their brands associated with ugly, questionable content. \nFor now, remember what Lincoln said. I can't say it any better than that. ",

      "text": "Over the past couple of years, Google has shown a strong focus on user experience on mobile devices. They have developed their algorithms to address customer experience and usability and to encourage organizations to meet certain standards.\nFor instance, Mobilegeddon looked not only at the responsiveness of a mobile site, but how truly mobile-friendly a site was with photos, font sizes and more. Google AMP pushed an open-source design structure, created by Google to make the user experience on mobile faster and more efficient.\nThe announcement of Google’s latest algorithm, which penalizes sites that use mobile pop-up ads, is consistent with the heart of the changes they’ve been making lately. According to Google’s Webmaster Central Blog, Google plans to make two major changes:\nIn 2014, Google introduced the mobile-friendly label, which indicated that the site being shown in the search results was specifically optimized for mobile. This label was applied to sites where a user was able to read the text and digest content without having to zoom and where buttons and calls to action were spaced properly. Two years later, Google is finding that 85 percent of mobile search are, in fact, optimized for mobile specifically and meet the above criteria. This means Google is doing away with the “mobile-friendly” label and will instead rank sites according to a mobile-specific algorithm that will focus on mobile-specific ranking material. The other change — and one of the key aspects to this mobile algorithm — is obviously user experience. According to Google , they have “recently seen many examples where these pages show intrusive interstitials to users. While the underlying content is present on the page and available to be indexed by Google, content may be visually obscured by an interstitial. This can frustrate users because they are unable to easily access the content that they were expecting when they tapped on the search result.” This means that sites that have pop-ups (or interstitials, as Google likes to call them) create a poorer user experience, especially on mobile devices with smaller screens.\nAs a result, the site with intrusive interstitials will be penalized and may not rank as high in the search results.\nWhich pop-up techniques are acceptable and which are not? Here are some examples of techniques that, according to Google, make content less accessible to a user:\nShowing a pop-up that covers the main content, either immediately after the user navigates to a page from the search results or while they are looking through the page. Displaying a standalone interstitial that the user has to dismiss before accessing the main content. Using a layout where the above-the-fold portion of the page appears similar to a standalone interstitial, but the original content has been inlined underneath the fold. Here is a list of examples that will not be affected by the change:\nInterstitials that appear to be in response to a legal obligation, such as for cookie usage or for age verification. Login dialogs on sites where content is not publicly indexable. For example, this would include private content such as email or unindexable content that is behind a paywall. Banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space and are easily dismissible. For example, the app install banners provided by Safari and Chrome are examples of banners that use a reasonable amount of screen space. This change is expected to take place on January 10, 2017.\nSo what can you use instead of mobile interstitials? We all understand that calls to action are a normal part of marketing and are instrumental to on-site conversions. Users expect them in some form or another when consuming content. So how can you promote engagement within your content, without resorting to annoying (and soon-to-be rank harming) pop-ups?\nNow, to be clear, as outlined above, there are still plenty of ways you can use interstitials. They simply have to be done in a less invasive way. There are plenty of other ways you can create points of engagement from within your content as well. Below are a couple of ideas to consider.\nIn-text hyperlinks There are a few instances where in-text hyperlinks can work well as calls to action. These are separate from simply linking to a product or service page. In order to replace a pop-up ad, which had previously been driving lead generation, you will want these hyperlinks to point to a landing page of some kind.\nThis could be as simple as “Sign up to our mailing list to stay up to date on our latest sales, promotions and news,” with a link from the words “sign up.”\nStill struggling to optimize your site for mobile devices? Download our guide, Mobile SEO For Your Web Presence for quick tips and pointers. Yes, we literally just used an example as an actual CTA ;)\nCall-to-action prompts Prompts can be used in much the same way a banner can, but they are often far less intrusive for the user and tend to blend in with the rest of the content more naturally. Many website themes include shortcodes for prompts to do the heavy lifting for you. Prompts can often include a headline, some body copy, maybe an image and a button.\nHere is an example of the style of prompts we have used on our blog:\nThe key with using prompts is to follow the same warnings outlined by Google for banners. Make sure all text and images are easily read on a mobile device.\nCustomer experience comes first As much as this change will ultimately hurt companies who rely on the ad venue to survive, our job as marketers is to solve customer pain points, not create them. Like Google, our focus should be on the user experience and not website traffic and conversion rates.\n“The single most important thing is to make people happy.

      "text": "Google Toilet Locator to Reportedly Be Launched in Collaboration With Ministry of Urban Development Google to launch new feature in collaboration with MoUD Pilot run reportedly to be tested in NCR MoUD plans to roll out the feature across India \nHave you ever been stuck in a situation where you are unable to locate a clean toilet near you? Well, Google may soon come to your aide in India. The search giant is said to launch a new feature dubbed 'Toilet Locator' which will be introduced in collaboration with the Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD). \nAccording to a new report, Google will start a pilot run of the new feature in the National Capital Region starting \"some time from November 16 to November 30.\" The feature will be integrated in to Google Maps and will let anyone search for a nearby toilet, just as one searches for any other place on the Maps app. The feature is reportedly being piloted under Government of India's Swachhata Pakhwada, or Cleanliness Fortnight campaign. \nA MoUD official claimed that the ministry \"is already in the process of rolling out this facility in the NCR region\" and it will include public restrooms that are located in metro stations, malls, petrol pumps, and hospitals. \nAnother official who asked not to be named suggested that the process to list the available toilets in the NCR region was \"almost over.\" One of the official explaining the process told IBTimes India, \"People will first need to open Google Maps, and then search for toilets near them. They can search for a variety of keywords, like toilet, lavatory, swach, swachhata, shulabh or shauchalay, and Google will point them to the nearest toilets.\" According to the report, the Toilet Locator will be depending on \"heavily on crowdsourcing\" and will see feedback from people. This means that people will be able to rate the cleanliness of the toilet they last searched via Google Maps, or even leave a review, just as they would for any other public establishment on Google Maps. Unfortunately, there is no word when the 'Toilet Locator' will be available to users across India. Though, the MoUD official stressed that \"Mechanisms are in place for the facility to be scaled up, and for it to reach all the 2,041 urban local bodies (ULBs) of the country.\"\nNotably, this is not the first such attempt to offer help to people via an app. Earlier this year, Delhi saw the launch of Find x Toilet app that helped locate a toilet nearest to one's current location.",

      "text": "Google and India's government will launch a toilet finder It will show toilets in malls, hospitals and other public places within Maps. Share Save \nGoogle has teamed up with India's Ministry of Urban Development (MoUD) to develop a toilet locator tool within Maps . The country has a pretty infamous toilet problem , with around 70 percent of households not having access to their own. According to Public Radio International , 60 percent of the 1.2 billion people in the nation still defecate and urinate in the open, leading to serious sanitation issues. Google and MoUD aim to tackle that dilemma by giving people the power to search for toilets within Maps by typing relevant words in English or in their native language, like \"toilet,\" \"lavatory,\" \"swachhata\" and \"shulabh.\" Maps will then show available toilets in the same way it shows hotels, restaurants and other establishments. \nA MoUD official told International Business Times that they're relying on people to let other users know of a particular location's condition. \"The system being put in place relies heavily on crowdsourcing, with people's feedback helping fuel it,\" he said. If a toilet isn't clean or if it's already closed, \"he or she can give it a bad review or rating.\" The tool will be available in Delhi before November ends and will show not just public toilets, but also those in malls, gas stations, hospitals and other places anyone can go to. MoUD wants to expand the program to cover other urban areas, but that could take a while: the ministry doesn't have a concrete plan or timeline yet.",

Google Has The Answer Because I need a precise unit of measure for how many tacos I ate last night. W hen I was first learning units of measure in elementary school, our teacher had us build a measurement man out of construction paper. He looked something like this: As I grew up, I often thought of measurement man when baking or grocery shopping for liquids. He did not come in handy, however, when I needed to figure out more…nuanced units. Like what does it mean when my friend says she has a “shitload of work to do”? And how does that compare to my sister’s “fuckton of student loans”? Alas, my construction-paper pal had no answers for me. So I turned to the internet, where a Reddit post on r/shittyaskscience offered this complete breakdown, from a delicate little buttload all the way to a big fat fuckton: buttload * 10 = 1 butt tonbutt ton * 10 = 1 assloadassload * 10 = 1 asston ",

      "title": "Google’s DNI fund puts €24M into 124 news projects across Europe",
      "text": "× Hi! \nYou are about to activate our Facebook Messenger news bot. Once subscribed, the bot will send you a digest of trending stories once a day. You can also customize the types of stories it sends you. \nClick on the button below to subscribe and wait for a new Facebook message from the TC Messenger news bot. \nThanks, TC Team Google’s DNI fund puts €24M into 124 news projects across Europe Posted Full Fact aims to end fake news with automated fact checking tools \nGoogle’s ongoing effort to rehabilitate its reputation with the world of publishing in Europe took another step forward today. The Digital News Initiative , a group formed by the search giant to explore, promote and financially back new efforts in news publishing, announced that it is putting €24 million ($26 million) into 124 projects across 25 countries in Europe. The efforts span major newspapers embarking on projects to advance data journalism and the use of AI to surface stories for readers; through to non-profits developing ways to weed out fake news , a timely subject in the wake of the recent U.S. election. \nMore highlights on the projects below, and a detailed run-down can be found here . \nThis is the second tranche of funding from the DNI, which was launched in 2015 and opened up for applications a year ago . If 124 sounds like a lot of projects, that appears to be the strategy for Google here: fund many people with smaller sums of money. The first group of funded projects, announced earlier this year , numbered 128, which received a total of €30 million. \nGoogle’s efforts to support news organizations trying out new things comes at the same time that the company is trying to negotiate a path forward in Europe with regulators, who are coming after it with a series of antitrust suits covering not just its search business, but its mobile Android business well. Those cases are ongoing. \nIt also comes at a time when many of them are struggling against the economics of the news industry, a trend that is hurting not just smaller outfits but some of the most iconic among them. The WSJ and the Guardian are among the larger publications that have announced job cuts; among some of the newer and more innovative groups, Fusion and Univision have said they will lay off up to 250 staff, with some of that already taking effect. \nSome have laid at least part of the blame for the slow demise of the news industry at Google’s feet (and more recently Facebook’s) because of the way that they aggregate and share headlines and offers its own way to quickly scan the basics of stories without needing to click into publishers’ own sites, making it a challenge to institute subscriptions or paywalls around that content. Still, others have tried to forge ways of working with these portal behemoths, for example by incorporating Google’s AMP project and Facebook’s Instant Articles to make the experience of viewing articles faster (and giving up some of their traffic in the process). \nThe DNI sits as a counterbalance to this, with some 180 members from across the industry in Europe. \nLudovic Blecher, the head of Digital News Initiative Innovation Fund at Google, said that the main criteria for this latest tranche of funding included not only “impact, innovation and project feasibility” but also projects focused on collaboration. “The projects that stood out prioritise collaborative approaches between publishers, academics, designers and entrepreneurs, both within a single country and across Europe,” he said. The range of individual funding can go from €50,000 to €300,000 typically, although can be higher in special cases. \nGetting even €50,000 from Google is a competitive process. There were 850 submissions for this latest round of funding, and Google said that 43 focus on collaboration. “We see this collaboration–across countries, across newsrooms and across specialties–as an amazing display of the intent to energise the European news ecosystem with new ideas, new technologies and more,” he notes. Among those getting funding: Spiegel Online – Germany – in collaboration with Institut für Spielanalyse & TU München What happens when you mix sports reporting and data science? With EUR 689,116 from the DNI , Spiegel’s collaborative project aims to create an entirely new way for readers and journalists to experience and analyze soccer games. With a goal of using new approaches in data collection, data interpretation and player analysis, Spiegel Online plans to help fans become experts–using novel applications of artificial intelligence. Corriere della Sera: The Vocal Bot – Italy With EUR 300,000 in funding, Corriere della Sera will pursue the design of a digital assistant where Corriere della Sera can answer users’ news-related questions on a variety of devices. The ambition is to be able to answer natural language queries such as “Please, tell me the latest on the Brexit” or “Who won today’s GP?.” The “Digital Assistant” will read headlines and articles, search Corriere della Sera’s archives, and scrape the publisher’s digital content for material. Le Temps SA – Switzerland The industry agrees that exceptional content increases loyalty and engagement. So with EUR 45,000 in funding, Le Temps is pursuing a tool to resurface and republish the newsroom’s best ‘evergreen’ articles when they relate to current events. Called “Zombie,” the tool will analyse articles on Le Temps’ website using data from both Chartbeat and Google Analytics and apply a score to each piece. At the same time Zombie will analyse web activity for trending topics–which can be matched to Le Temp’s database of content. If so, the tool will alert the newsroom.

      "text": "I stood at the peak of Mount Rainier, the tallest mountain in Washington State. The sounds of wind whipped past my ears, and mountains and valleys filled a seemingly endless horizon in every direction. I'd never seen anything like it—until I grabbed the sun.\nUsing my HTC Vive virtual reality wand, I reached into the heavens in order to spin the Earth along its normal rotational axis, until I set the horizon on fire with a sunset. I breathed deeply at the sight, then spun our planet just a little more, until I filled the sky with a heaping helping of the Milky Way galaxy.\nVirtual reality has exposed me to some pretty incredible experiences, but I've grown ever so jaded in the past few years of testing consumer-grade headsets. Google Earth VR , however, has dropped my jaw anew. This, more than any other game or app for SteamVR's \"room scale\" system, makes me want to call every friend and loved one I know and tell them to come over, put on a headset, and warp anywhere on Earth that they please.\nJetpack mode, engage First stop: My hometown of Seattle. Clicking to get closer in a bird's eye perspective. At every altitude, different labels appear. I might have had my other wand hand backwards to emulate a baseball batter's stance. No telling. \"The crowd goes wild! Awwwshhhzzzhhhtttrawwwrr!\" (That's me making fake crowd noise sounds with my mouth. Just, you know, enjoying a sunset that I created WITH MY HANDS. Be warned: Not every place in Google Earth VR is rendered with so much 3D data. For example, here's me hanging out in eerily flat Pyongyang. (Then again, I wouldn't put it past Kim Jong Un to have flattened much of North Korea as some sort of bizarre supreme-leader ruling.) Google Earth VR , which is currently a free exclusive for HTC Vive owners, will look familiar to anybody who's used Google's \"Earth\" mapping apps before. You can grab the globe, zoom in and out anywhere, and see finer details as you zoom closer to any location. But this VR variant differs largely in that it reveals just how much 3D-mapped content the app really has—and displays it as handsomely as its limited system possibly can.\nTake, for example, my casual flyover near Seattle's Centurylink Field. I launched the app while floating high above the planet Earth and was instructed to use the Vive wands to move around. One button zoomed me closer, while another let me \"grab\" the planet and reorient it. I used these motions to spin the globe towards North America, then the USA, then Washington, until I was close enough to trigger a perspective shift. Before, I was looking down from a bird's eye view; now, I was more level, like a guy in a jetpack flying over a city and checking it out.\nWith a few more taps, I was no longer flying; I was on ground level at \"average adult height.\"\nFurther Reading HTC Vive goes wireless with pricey upgrade kit This is where Google Earth VR gets cool. After flying toward Seattle's football stadium, I thought it might be fun to walk through it. And I could. A few taps later, I was there, on the 50-yard line, throwing my hands up like some ridiculous version of Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman.\nThe reason this felt fun is because so much of the stadium's interior geometry had been rendered precisely—and the same went for the Seattle baseball stadium on the next block. Google Earth has juiced its assets up with 3D material that almost certainly wasn't captured solely from a satellite above, and that really sells the \"I'm really there\" feeling that you might expect.\nSome of Google Earth VR 's content looks really, really crappy, though. Squishy geometry and fuzzy textures will make some of your favorite real-life locations look like they'd been ripped out of an N64 game. But being able to stand around at one-for-one scale with a famed building, landmark, or national park, and get lost in the full, 360-degree feeling that everything nearby is at least rendered at total proportionate accuracy, helps wash the squishy geometry down.\n(Be warned: This level of detail does not apply to much of the non-Western world within Google Earth VR . You'll have a lot of better luck finding fully rendered geometry in American cities than in others.)\nA quick detour to Burning Man Menus make it easy to pick out known landmarks. Google HQ? Fine, let's go. I can aim a pointer at the miniature globe floating above my left hand at any time to quickly back out and warp elsewhere. Peace out, Google. Kazakhstan, here we come. Google Earth VR also uses clever tricks to keep users feeling comfortable while they're spinning and warping their nearby environs. You'll use the Vive wand as a pointer and grabber to transform your scale or location in the app—and while you do that, the view shrinks to a tiny periscope view until the motion has settled. It's still possible to make yourself queasy by grabbing and moving the Earth too quickly, but that sensation is easy to immediately halt, at least. Otherwise, motion takes place in controllable bursts, as opposed to swimmy, dizzying \"flight\" paths. (In other words, don't be worried by how sickening the app's official demo trailer looks.)\nPre-loaded coordinates appear in a simple menu interface, and new users will want to warp around the Earth with these for some of the app's most spectacular locations. The list is long and is full of landmarks like Big Ben, national parks like Yosemite, oddball spots like the deserts of Burning Man, and even a few outer-space locations (like a floating spot from which you can see a solar eclipse). The nifty \"tours\" tab will automatically and comfortably warp Vive novices through a series of global locations based on a certain theme (\"water,\" \"parks\"), and I found these particularly soothing, since they wrest control from users during a 3-5 minute time span to show off a variety of worldwide locales.\nThe worst aspect of Google Earth VR in its launch state is an inability to type in cities, landmarks, or other custom coordinates. If you want to go to, say, your childhood home in VR, you'll have to grab the planet yourself and pick through roads, landmarks, and terrain until you find the old homestead at 227 Charleston Avenue. In my case, I struggled to find my childhood home for a while, especially when I mistook my old middle school for my old high school. Google Earth VR displays city names and landmark names, but roads and smaller details go unlabeled. (Once you find a spot, you can bookmark it for a quick return, at least.)\nFurther Reading Here’s where you can try out the HTC Vive without spending $800 That hindrance, and the fact that some content renders quite weirdly, are worth tempering expectations over. The Statue of Liberty and Fenway Park are not perfect replicas here. But even these feel cool to fly over and walk through, and you can warp between them and far more convincingly rendered outdoor scenes with just a few clicks.\nExpect to lose at least an hour just flying around the Earth—and the immediate future fantasizing about where you'll warp next time you put a Vive on. Google says this will remain an HTC Vive exclusive indefinitely.\nWhat's the best VR headset for you? We find out via a series of totally objective, 100 percent useful tests. Maybe.",

Check out these apps first Tech Manish Singh / 3 hours ago Image: Pacific Press/Sipa USA \nFintech companies and app developers are cashing in on India's demonetization. \nFor the next several weeks, Indians have no choice but to queue up outside banks and ATMs in dim hopes of getting some cash out. But now there are apps and bots to help. \nIt’s been more than a week since India’s Prime Minister told the nation that the country is demonetizing its most circulated tender bills — Rs 500 ($7.5), and Rs 1,000 ($15) . The instant panic that pushed people to ATMs that Tuesday evening has since only gotten worse . But if you plan well, you can avoid wasting time on those queues. Find the nearest ATM \nImage: Screengrab / Google \nAs a pleasant surprise, Google has added a shortcut on its homepage for India that lets people quickly locate all the nearest ATMs. If you go to Google India website , you will find an option called \"Find an ATM near you\". Clicking this takes you to Google Maps with your location already entered. The page instantly shows you all the nearest automatic teller machines. Clicking on any of them will bring up more information, including the Google Maps integration to get to an ATM booth. \nCMS, one of the largest cash management service, has also launched a website called CMS ATM Finder . All you have to do is go to the website, add your location and it will let you know about nearby CMS-powered ATMs. Find ATMs that are functioning \nImage: walnut \nNot all the ATMs are currently functional in India, with many going through upgradation for compatibility with new currency notes. Finance management app Walnut has launched a new feature that lets people find the ATMs that are working. It does so by tracking aggregate ATM withdrawals across India in real time. Walnut also keeps a track of ATM usage of its users, so it knows if some other Walnut app user has just withdrawn cash from an ATM, you will likely do too. Know whether an ATM has any cash left \nCoimbatore-based startup Timebender Technologies has launched a Facebook chat bot called ATMBot that lets users know about the cash availability in nearby ATMs. \nSimilarly, if you’re still unsure about what you’re supposed to do with your old current notes, there’s another Facebook Messenger Bot by Indian firm GupShup which walks users through the process and answers their queries.",

      "text": "Story highlights Google project gives instant results for home solar potential Data covers 42 US states and 43 million buildings It was born out of famed '20 percent time' scheme Marrakech, Morocco (CNN) If you've ever thought about putting solar panels on your roof, you know that the process doesn't exactly qualify as an impulse purchase.\nTypically, it involves multiple visits from solar installers. The standard practice in the industry is to go up on the rooftop with a fish-eye camera, then take a picture from each of the four corners to make an estimate of the solar potential of the roof. What if you could do that from your computer instead, and all by yourself? Enter Project Sunroof, a Google tool that uses high-resolution 3D data and artificial intelligence to allow you to do exactly that. Read More A better (Google) Earth Project Sunroof shares some of its technology with the familiar Google Maps and Google Earth, and then adds its own spin to it. Photographer captures beauty of Nevada solar plant \"The centerpiece of the technology is a 3D model of the world that does shadowcasting, which means that for every point of a roof we can determine whether there will be shade or not, for every time of the day, every day of the year,\" Joel Conkling, Google's principal of energy and sustainability, told CNN, from the COP22 climate change conference, in Marrakech. Users in covered areas -- 42 US states and about 43 million buildings at the moment -- can go to the Sunroof Project website, enter their address and see an estimate of the energy production potential of their roof right away, and the actual savings based on weather data (less sunny areas will yield less power) and the price of electricity from the local utility. \"We connect directly to the providers, so customers can immediately get a quote. You can ask for your proposal within two minutes,\" says Conkling. Google Project Sunroof estimates that a roof in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts experiences 1,479 hours of usable sunlight per year. This amounts to an estimated $18,000 in net savings for the roof with a 20-year lease. Machine learning To make this possible, Google uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. \"Our system can automatically identify buildings and then extract information about the roof, including how it's angled, the direction it's pointing, and whether there are trees in its vicinity,\" said Conkling. The end result is at least as accurate as going up on the roof, according to Conkling.

      "text": "Story highlights Google project gives instant results for home solar potential Data covers 42 US states and 43 million buildings It was born out of famed '20 percent time' scheme Marrakech, Morocco (CNN) If you've ever thought about putting solar panels on your roof, you know that the process doesn't exactly qualify as an impulse purchase.\nTypically, it involves multiple visits from solar installers. The standard practice in the industry is to go up on the rooftop with a fish-eye camera, then take a picture from each of the four corners to make an estimate of the solar potential of the roof. What if you could do that from your computer instead, and all by yourself? Enter Project Sunroof, a Google tool that uses high-resolution 3D data and artificial intelligence to allow you to do exactly that. Read More A better (Google) Earth Project Sunroof shares some of its technology with the familiar Google Maps and Google Earth, and then adds its own spin to it. Photographer captures beauty of Nevada solar plant \"The centerpiece of the technology is a 3D model of the world that does shadowcasting, which means that for every point of a roof we can determine whether there will be shade or not, for every time of the day, every day of the year,\" Joel Conkling, Google's principal of energy and sustainability, told CNN, from the COP22 climate change conference, in Marrakech. Users in covered areas -- 42 US states and about 43 million buildings at the moment -- can go to the Sunroof Project website, enter their address and see an estimate of the energy production potential of their roof right away, and the actual savings based on weather data (less sunny areas will yield less power) and the price of electricity from the local utility. \"We connect directly to the providers, so customers can immediately get a Quote: . You can ask for your proposal within two minutes,\" says Conkling. Google Project Sunroof estimates that a roof in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts experiences 1,479 hours of usable sunlight per year. This amounts to an estimated $18,000 in net savings for the roof with a 20-year lease. Machine learning To make this possible, Google uses advanced machine learning algorithms to analyze the data. \"Our system can automatically identify buildings and then extract information about the roof, including how it's angled, the direction it's pointing, and whether there are trees in its vicinity,\" said Conkling. The end result is at least as accurate as going up on the roof, according to Conkling. Gardens in the sky: The rise of eco urban architecture The only catch is that the source data must be very detailed: Project Sunroof doesn't use satellite photos, because the resolution isn't enough, but high quality imagery which is available only where Google has flown airplanes to collect aerial shots. \"For that reason we probably won't ever get to cover all the buildings in the US, or any country for that matter.

      "title": "Pixel phone resellers banned from using Google accounts | Technology",
      "text": "Google has suspended the accounts of hundreds of people who took advantage of a loophole in US sales tax to make a small profit on Pixel phones.\nThe Google customers had all bought the phones from the company’s Project Fi mobile carrier, and had them shipped directly to a reseller in New Hampshire, an US state with no sales tax. In return, the reseller split the profit with the customers.\nSuch an arrangement is against Google’s terms of service, which state that customers “may only purchase Devices for your personal use [and] may not commercially resell any Device”.\nBut, according to US money-saving site Dan’s Deals , which spotted the bans after a number of forum members complained, the New Hampshire dealer has been exploiting the loophole for years with previous Google phones, and not had any issues.\n\nGoogle users who did buy the Pixel phones haven’t only had their access to Google’s store rescinded. Instead, their entire accounts have been suspended, losing them access to their mail, photos, documents, and anything else linked to their Google identity. One user reported that an account that hadn’t been used to purchase a Pixel was suspended, apparently because it was listed as a back-up address for an account that had.\n“I’m not defending those who violated the terms of the sale, but I do think it is heavy-handed for Google to block access to all of their services for doing so,” wrote Daniel Eleff, the owner of the site. “Was violating Google’s phone resale policy really worthy of an effective digital death penalty?”\nUsers have lost photos saved in Google Photos, while others have been further locked out of other accounts that have the password reset functionality linked to Gmail. “It’s the 21st century version of losing priceless mementos in a house fire,” Eleff writes.\nThe Guardian has asked Google for an explanation of the bans, and whether it considers the moves heavy-handed.\nSuspending accounts for terms of service violations is a common punishment for many digital businesses, but in the age of massive conglomeration, it’s increasingly leading to onerous punishment for only minor infractions. \nIn March, for instance, Amazon was revealed to be banning users from the site if they returned too many faulty goods . It is within the site’s legal rights to choose who to serve, and the bans were intended to crack down on those who abused the company’s no-questions-asked returns policies. \nBut given the scale of Amazon, such bans are far more punishing than simply being unable to return to a brick-and-mortar retail establishment. Users lose any credit balance on the site and the use of any remaining months on their annual Amazon Prime membership. \nThey also lose access to the company’s digital services: any Kindles they own are unable to be loaded with new books, or replaced within the warranty period, while Amazon’s streaming services including Prime TV and Music Unlimited are also inaccessible with a banned account, rendering devices such as the Echo and Fire TV little more than expensive paperweights.",

      "text": "It appears Google has come up with the VR technology game-changer we’ve all been waiting for. Since launching yesterday, the God-like realism of the new Google Earth VR app has people across the internet losing their shit and wondering, “How?!”\nAfter strapping on one of Google’s $79 headsets, users enter a virtual reality world which they can explore at street level or hover above like some kind of messianic figure. A slew of world landmarks have been incorporated, along with cinematic tours of select, hand-picked destinations. This means that if, for some reason, you’ve ever fancied rocking up to somewhere like the Taj Mahal in nothing but your underwear, you can now freely do so without offending anyone.\nJust in case you wondered how amazing Google Earth in VR is…. https://t.co/XbI69XXzP1 pic.twitter.com/LnkM6oEPzl \n— Tim Johnson (@marmalade_tim) November 16, 2016 \n\nThe new Google Earth in VR on @htcvive is absolutely stunning. F***ing stunning. Very well done Google. My kids are going to learn a ton.\n— Robert Scoble (@Scobleizer) November 17, 2016 \n\nBubbling over with emotion after playing with Google Earth VR. It's a killer app.\n— Josh Farkas (@JoshuaFarkas) November 17, 2016 \n\nEveryone should experience Google Earth VR. It’s a beautiful historic achievement of art & technology, and points towards an amazing future.\n— King Mob ↙️↙️↙️ (@sfslim) November 17, 2016 \n\nTo navigate the globe, users simply point and drag the Vive controller to where they want to go and, while it’s still early days, the app’s rapid development proves that VR has truly arrived. Might a virtual reality version of a game like GTA be that far off?\nCheck out the mind-blowing footage in the clip above, and then check out Google Earth VR at the Steam online store .\nStaying with Google, the tech giant recently launched Tango , a smartphone augmented reality system, at the start of the month.\n",

      "text": "Pixel, Phone by Google. Enjoy your favorite content, ad-free. Pixel, Phone by Google.Enjoy your favorite content, ad-free. iPhone camera might get AR features, report says Tech 685 shares Stan Schroeder / 2 hours ago The AR features in the iPhone's camera might be the first step towards Apple launching a pair of smartglasses. Image: Dustin Drankoski/Mashable \nWhile Apple has been slow to adopt virtual reality in its gadgets (the company has virtually nothing on that front so far), there's a chance that the company might at least jump on the augmented reality bandwagon. \nBusiness Insider , quoting a person familiar with the matter, says Apple plans to build AR features into the iPhone's camera app. SEE ALSO: There will be three new iPhones in 2017, report claims \nTo achieve this, Apple is reportedly working with several AR startups, as well as teams from AR/VR companies Metaio and Flyby Media which it had acquired in 2015 and 2016, respectively. \nIn terms of features, this could mean pointing your phone's camera to an object in the real world and have it recognized — a feature that sounds similar to the one offered by AR startup Blippar . Another possible feature would be face recognition and manipulation; similar features can be seen today on Snapchat and Facebook-acquired Masquerade . \nOnce the features are built into the iPhone's camera, Apple plans to release an SDK so that third party developers can tap into the technology and create AR apps of their own. \nNo timeline for any of these features is mentioned in the report. \nFor a somewhat scary but amazingly well done vision of an augmented reality future, see video above. \nThe new report ties into a Bloomberg report from earlier this week , which claimed that Apple is looking to launch a type of smartglasses, but that product likely won't see the light of day before 2018. \nAugmented reality has been a hot topic throughout 2016, mainly because of the surprising popularity of Niantic's AR game Pokemon Go , which has players visiting real-world locations to catch virtual creatures. \nA number of app developers followed suit , indicating that the demand for AR content might grow in the future.",

      "text": "Having Google and Facebook censor content is no way to stop fake news Mark Zuckerberg Eric Risberg / Associated Press Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at a conference in San Francisco on April 12. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers the keynote address at a conference in San Francisco on April 12. (Eric Risberg / Associated Press) The Times Editorial Board \nAs if the avalanche of misleading political advertisements weren’t bad enough, Internet users were subjected this year to a surge in supposed news stories about the presidential race that were even less truthful — in fact, much less truthful — than the 30-second spots aired by Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. And yet millions of readers happily recirculated this “fake news” as if it were independent and credible. \nThese included items claiming that Pope Francis had endorsed Trump , that emails released by WikiLeaks proved Hillary Clinton sold weapons to Islamic State and that an FBI agent investigating Clinton’s emails was killed in a mysterious murder-suicide . \nThis sort of thing goes beyond the complaint on the right that the mainstream media favored Clinton by publishing far more stories critical of Trump, or the complaint from the left that Trump received uncritical saturation coverage. The sites in question were circulating stories that they knew weren’t true, at times aided by bots that created huge fake audiences on social media. Surveys by Pew Research Center find that 62% of U.S. adults get at least some of their news from social media. \nThe problem is obvious: When surveys by Pew Research Center find that 62% of U.S. adults get at least some of their news from social media, and 20% of social-media users say things they read online have changed their views on an issue or candidate, the electorate is all the more vulnerable to a calculated campaign of manipulation and disinformation. According to Buzzfeed , the 20 most popular fake-news stories in the last three months of the campaign were shared more often on Facebook than the top 20 stories from leading mainstream news sites. Nearly 90% of the fake-news stories were pro-Trump or anti-Clinton, Buzzfeed noted. \nSome observers argue that the public’s receptivity to fake news is a sign that we live in a “post-factual” society, with people who are mainly interested in information that comports with their preexisting notions. That’s not a new phenomenon, however; people have been dividing into information tribes with competing echo chambers at least as long as there have been blatantly partisan talk radio stations and cable news channels. Nor is it new when politicians — and particularly Republicans — try to drive people away from established news sources by accusing them of bias. \nWhat’s different now is the extent of the polarization, and how vulnerable the system is to manipulation. With a vast and growing number of information sources, people don’t automatically discredit a website or a publisher just because they’ve never heard of it. And the news pipeline is no longer controlled by a small number of local broadcasters and newspapers; even the smallest publisher has free access to the global distribution services supplied by search engines and social media networks. Although those are welcome developments for free speech and diverse viewpoints, they also are a boon to those whose mission is not just to offer an alternative to the mainstream media, but to peddle flat-out falsehoods. \nHere’s another crucial difference: Unlike cable news networks, newspapers or local broadcasters, the most powerful distributors of content today — Facebook and Google search — do not want to be seen as media companies. They style themselves as open platforms, not content gatekeepers. \nBut that description is not quite accurate; both use technology and, in some cases, human editors to shape what they present to the public. And neither is willing to explain exactly how they do so, other than to say their goal is to deliver the most relevant results possible to individual users. As a consequence, Facebook prioritizes the material that users see in their “news feeds,” elevating some of their friends’ posts over others. Similarly, Google pushes some search results higher than others, depending on a secret list of signals it’s tuned to online. \nExecutives at both companies said this week that they are working on the problem of fake news, and already have measures in place to cut off the flow of advertising dollars to fake-news sites. Yet Facebook arguably made the problem worse this year, when it dumped the editors who helped curate its list of “trending” stories in favor of a more algorithm-driven approach. The change was made after former editors said their colleagues had favored mainstream news sources over alternative and conservative sites. But the new approach allowed bogus news items to taint the trending list. \nIt’s tempting to say that these platform operators should own up to the role they play in informing (or misleading) the public and do more to weed out bad information. But as Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted , telling the difference between fact, opinion and fiction is a tricky task. Good reporters can get things wrong, after all. \nThe fact that Facebook and Google are so powerful is reason enough not to want them to become censors. That doesn’t mean they can’t do more to identify and flag content that readers should question. They can also make it harder for publishers to game the system in ways that increase the audience for their content. Ultimately, though, their technologies rely on their users to elevate credible material over fantasies. And as long as people cling to the latter over the former, they’re holding the door open to disinformation campaigns and manipulation.

      "text": "  7:47am in #Mindcontrol #Facebook #Google #Twitter \nToday I see in the news that Google is trying to dehypnotize potential ISIS recruits by manipulating what content they see when they try to search for pro-ISIS stuff. That’s mind control. And it works. \nMeanwhile, Facebook is trying to have it both ways by insisting that advertising on their platform is effective while claiming the tsunami of fake news articles about the election – which outnumbered legitimate stories – had no impact on the election. But either way, it’s mind control. Because ads work. \nMind control also takes the form of A-B testing, which is common practice for most tech companies. That involves rapidly testing up to thousands of variables for different ad variations until they know what is the most effective way to manipulate consumers. In other words, mind control. And it works. \nTwitter is allegedly “shadowbanning” some users – including me – because they don’t like how I might be persuading people. Shadowbanning means limiting how many of my users see my content. That’s mind control, and it works. The fewer people that see what I tweet, the fewer I can influence. \nIn those four examples we can see that technology companies have already replaced some portion of human decision-making. Eventually machines will replace ALL of your decisions. \nHow’s that possible? \nIt’s possible because machines make better decisions than humans. Or they will. Consider your health-monitoring wristband. Someday it will tell you when you need to eat and what to eat. It will tell you when you are dehydrated and suggest that you take a drink. It will tell you the best time to exercise, and it will “train” you to do so, with rewards. In the short run, you will see your machines as making helpful suggestions. But once you learn that the machines always make good suggestions – and you do not – you will start taking the machine’s suggestions simply because it is easier. \nI would argue that your political choices are already largely determined by Facebook, Google, Twitter and the other media companies. It feels exactly like free will to you, but it isn’t. And someday soon our technology will tell us how to eat, when to sleep, when to sip water, when to exercise, and even who to date. Once married, technology will tell you the best time of the month for procreation. It might even clear your calendar by rescheduling your day. \nThe inevitable conclusion of all of these forces is that machines will someday make all of our important decisions. We are probably less than ten years away from that. \nLosing your free will to machines might sound scary. But you never had free will in the first place. It was always an illusion. When the machines take over our important decisions we will do the same thing we do now – we will imagine that we are making the decisions on our own. Today our important decisions are made with emotions, and rationalized after the fact. We incorrectly call this process “thinking.” In the near future, our machines will make our daily decisions using Big Data and whatever they know about us as individuals to maximize our outcomes. You’ll like that future because the machines will make better decisions than you, and you’ll have better quality of life. \nIn the new world ahead, you will be the robot – albeit a moist one. The machines will be doing the thinking and making the decisions. You will simply do what they program you to do. Like a robot. And all of that will happen before Artificial Intelligence is popular. In terms of capability, all the machines need in order to take over for human decision-making is lots of relevant data, body monitor sensors, and some pattern recognition software. We’re almost there. \n— \nYou might like reading my book because you haven’t taken 10,000 steps yet today and your fitness band says you should. \nAnd you might love my startup’s new app for geostreaming your location to a friend as you approach your meeting spot.

      "title": "Google Assistant needs Google consistent",
      "text": "\"Ok Google, skip ahead 30 seconds.\"\nGo ahead and ask that to your Pixel while playing music. A useless web search, right? Now try it on Google Home . It actually works. And that's the real shame, because this is happening across the board with Google Assistant: commands that work on Pixel don't work on Home, commands that work on Home don't work on Pixel, and don't get me started on the stripped-down version of Assistant Google is trying to peddle on Allo. The fragmentation that Google Assistant has seen in just two months on two products doesn't inspire confidence for current and potential users.\nThe fragmentation of Assistant across devices doesn't inspire confidence.\nI was so excited for Google Assistant. As a former Moto X user, I was quite looking forward to seeing an always-listening assistant who could connect and control more devices, more services, more tasks. While a Pixel was out of my price range, a Google Home was affordable (not cheap, but affordable) enough to indulge myself one. While many are dissuaded by the lack of services available at the moment, but as an early adopter of Chromecasts, I know it won't be like that for long. Once Actions on Google opens up next month to developers, the list of commands Google Assistant recognizes will rise quickly. Not being able to set reminders or watch purchased YouTube videos is a pain, but that's not the promise being lived down the most right now: it's consistency.\nThe Pixel is billed as the first phone with Google Assistant. The Home is billed as a voice-activated speaker powered by Google Assistant. Google Assistant is not just some lofty idea, not some beta that we early adopters get to play with before everyone else; Google Assistant is a selling point. Selling points only succeed if they work, and right now Google Assistant works — barely.\n\nGoogle Assistant is clearly meant to be a multi-platform assistant , from your watch to your car to your home and everywhere in between. If Google Assistant is going to be in all these places, and the closest/clearest device is going to be responding to your query whenever you cry \"Ok Google\" then no matter what device you pick up, the response needs to be the same. I should be able to say \"Ok Google, skip ahead 30 seconds\" in the car with as much success as I say it in the shower to Google Home. If I say \"Ok Google, call my mom\", Assistant on Google Home should be able to recognize that it can't place calls and kick the command back to my phone, just as it kicks the \"Answering on another device\" message to it every time I use OK Google in earshot of both devices.\nYes, Google Assistant is a service in its infancy, but the products it's running on are otherwise complete thoughts. The Pixel is the first phone from Google where it feels like a complete thought rather than a beta device for developers, and Google Assistant is one of its secret weapons . Google Home is a powerful little speaker that works wonderfully as a Google Cast target, and its touchpad top is giving me all kinds of clickwheel nostalgia, but $130 is too much for a Cast-speaker alone. Google Home is going to live and die on Google Assistant.\n\nThere's little doubt Google Assistant can be more amazing than voice-enabled chatbot or AI to date… but it needs to be whole to accomplish that, not fragmented across devices and platforms.\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?
