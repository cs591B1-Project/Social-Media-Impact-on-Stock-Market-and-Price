      "text": "  Pick of the Day » Pick of the Day: 1948 Ford resto-rod convertible Pick of the Day: 1948 Ford resto-rod convertible Posted on: By: Bob Golfen   The Ford convertible looks like what might have been seen at a ’50s drive-in This is the kind of old-school street rod that appeals to me: a nicely restored classic that’s lowered though not slammed so much that you can’t get in your driveway, wheels that are appropriate and not too flashy, and completely usable since it’s powered by the ubiquitous 350 cid Chevy V8 with automatic. \nThe Pick of the Day is a 1948 Ford convertible advertised on ClassicCars.com by a private seller in Cleburne, Texas, who described it as “fully restored.” The information with the ad is pretty skimpy although the photos tell the tale. I believe the model would be a Super Deluxe. The top looks to be in good condition \nThe handsome car is black with lots of shiny stock trim, and the top and updated interior are tan. The car rolls on red steel wheels with chrome rings and “poverty” hubcaps. Overall, a great look that I favor. \nThe resto rod looks like a vintage build though most likely it was done not too long ago to emulate the typical style of ’50s customs. The ad lists some of the aftermarket parts that went into the Ford to give it the right look, stance and drivability, which the seller calls, “All the good stuff!” \nThe ’48 Ford was the last of the automaker’s pre-war holdover designs before it ramped up its style for ’49 with the classic “shoebox” sedans. As such, it still has tremendous appeal to collectors who enjoy the older look. \nThe asking price is $35,000 or best offer for a cool top-down resto-rod cruiser that you could drive anywhere. \nTo view this listing on ClassicCars.com, see Pick of the Day Related Stories",

      "text": "Ford to invest $195 million in new India tech center November 8, 2016 - 15:33   Ford Motor Co (F.N) is investing 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in the Indian city of Chennai to develop new products, design mobility solutions and provide business services, Reuters reveals. \nDearborn, Michigan-based Ford, which has already invested over $2 billion in India till date, will hire 3,000 people and bring in 9,000 from other centers in the southern Indian city to staff the facility which will be operational by early 2019, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. \nFord is focusing on emerging markets like India where small, inexpensive yet powerful cars are popular and which is dominated by brands from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MRTI.NS) and Hyundai Motor Co (005380.KS). \nThe center will be the car maker's second-largest technology setup outside its global headquarters, and will include laboratories and testing facilities for vehicles and components, to enable Ford to test future products in India. \nWith India expected to become the world's third-largest market by 2020, according to IHS Automotive, global car makers want a bigger share of the pie. \n\"India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,\" Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, said in the statement. \nThe new center will also include teams working on advanced financial analysis and future data analytics, the company said.

      "title": "Ford Escape EcoBoost Titanium 2.0 AWD: Escape the city!",
      "text": "A A- The Escape is clear proof that Ford has found its way in the small car market.- \nI’ve honestly never been a big fan of Ford until much recently. Their lineup of turbocharged cars, crossovers and SUVs has really grown on me. \nIt’s similar to what people say about money and problems: pouring money into a problem might not be the most efficient way to solve it, but it often gets the job done. \nIn the same vein, add in a healthy dose of power (and torque) into any vehicle, and it becomes supremely far more enjoyable. EcoBoost is life! \nThe third generation Escape (we never got the second gen, while the first gen, quite frankly, looked horrible for me) looks properly globally modern: it neither looks too Americanized, nor an Asian version of an American product. It truly looks like a global citizen at home in Asia, Europe and America. \nIt is powered by a choice of two turbocharged and direct-injected engines, one displacing 1.6 liters, and this top-model AWD Titanium variant gets the nicer 240 hp and 366 Newton meter four cylinder. \nIt delivers power quite smoothly and progressively to the front wheels via a 6-speed automatic transmission. Ford’s 2000cc EcoBoost engine \nAside from the really nice engine (a real gem), we also get Ford’s latest tech toys, namely: Ford Sync, My Ford Touch powered by Microsoft, and Intelligent All-Wheel Drive (essentially an on-demand, all-wheel drive system that delivers torque to the rear axle once the fronts start slipping). \nYou almost never feel the intelligent AWD working: it delivers power seamlessly to the rears, but there’s so much mechanical grip from the Escape’s front wheels and tires to begin with. \nOn a cold day, on a slippery and wet driveway, or with mud-covered tires, you might get it into action, but it happens so smoothly you don’t really think much about it. \nSuspension is via a Macpherson-strut front and a multi-link rear, which provides a very controlled and compliant ride despite running on 19-inch wheels with 235/45R19 tires. It’s on the firm side, but I like it, and it matches the Escape’s Bahn-blasting demeanor. The Escape’s 18-inch wheels \nOther SUVs may handle better than the Escape, but that’s not to say that the Ford doesn’t want to play in the corners; it just really prefers more modest curves, and lots and lots of wide open highways. \nBut there’s an abundance of grip for sure, and even on dirt-roads, the Escape’s chassis and suspension cope admirably. \nThere is noticeable body roll (it is a tall crossover, and not a sports car), but it’s all good. You can feel the structural stiffness, and the suspension’s stroke working fine soaking up all the high-speed road imperfections. \nOn my weekly sojourn to Tagaytay, the Escape preferred SLEX and the Skyway more than the winding Tagaytay Santa-Rosa Highway, but it was fun nonetheless as the 366 Newton meters of torque and the instant, lag-free response meant overtaking slower moving cars, tricycles and cyclists was like shooting fish in a barrel. \nI guess if I were to levy a mild form of complaint, it’s that there’s a slight delay in the Escape’s weight transfer from wheel corner to wheel corner. But then again, that’s nit-picking in this segment. \nThe engine/transmission’s response can also be a bit rough when you accidentally tip into the gas pedal a little harder than you would have wanted. Again, nit-picking. \nThanks to turbocharging, I was able to get a very decent sub 7 km/liter in the city with a good mix of traffic and stop-and-go situations, and a very good 14 km/liter out on the highway, carefully observing the speed limit and my right foot’s erhm position. \nDespite being turbocharged, the Escape’s EcoBoost engine isn’t picky with fuel, so 93 RON Octane is fine, but if you plan to keep blasting away, higher is better. \nInside, driving position has also vastly improved compared to the previous Escape. \nSteering effort is on the light side, but offers decent feel. There’s that sense of getting used to American-style ergonomics versus Japanese style, but after a few hours behind the wheel, you get used to where the controls and buttons are. \nThe rear seats are surprisingly not as roomy as one would expect, and the interior plastics still need to catch up to some of the Japanese brands in terms of fitment, durability (the Escape’s plastics scratch easily), soft-touch feel, and tactility. \nSpec-wise, the Escape is right up there: seven airbags, ABS-EBD brakes, front and rear parking sensors with reverse camera plus cross-traffic alert (handy when clueless pedestrians walk past you as you’re backing out), and traction/stability control. \nThe hands-free tail-gate opens with a kick underneath the rear bumper, and cargo space in the boot is pretty good. \nYou also get a moon roof that really sets the mood for some star-gazing on a clear night sky. There’s even a three-prong 110-volt electrical socket in the rear. \nThanks to the One Ford Program, Ford is rationalizing and aligning products with markets all over the world, simplifying their product range, and thus freeing up R&D budgets to design, engineer and build better cars. \nSmaller markets like the Philippines will benefit from this as we get better specified cars; while markets like the US will in turn get more fuel-efficient cars. \nThe Escape is a really eye-opening car. The F150 pick-ups, Mustangs, and large SUVs like the Explorer and Expedition, have always been a staple and core product of Ford. But their smaller cars haven’t been able to match the Japanese. \nHaving tried the Escape and Focus, though, I’m convinced Ford has found its way in the small car market. There’s a genuine sense of enjoyment and excitement when you get behind the wheel of Ford vehicles now, something that was missing a few years back. Get  ",

      "text": "This isn’t the first time you’ve seen the Ford GT Welcome Guide on the Internet, but this is the first time you’ve read color commentary from a renowned journalist autoblogger connected to a GT purchase via his brother’s future acquisition. This page is both exciting and reassuring — it’s all about adding structure to the uneducated guesses on when TTAC’s Ford GT will reach production! But I’m getting ahead of myself. Such uplifting words thrust an unreachably high halo car further into the rarified air of a multi-national corporation’s spirit animal. Like, awesome …so when are we getting one? “Our” Ford GT Concierge’s first interaction aims to hook us up with a date for our allocation, because reading this is gut-wrenchingly torturous. First world problems, man. THEY REAL! Jalopnik already posted these numbers, so to The Powers That Be in Dearborn : remember, my brother wasn’t behind this. Preferred dealer? Already done! T hanks to my full time gig that I’d never astroturf on TTAC, our selling dealer is a GT Authorized service center with five-plus of these beasties to be delivered. Most of this can be credited to my brother’s reputation within the Ford GT community (giving further insight into why he got one). Bourdain was right about my city’s diversity and misplaced underdog status — plus, we might have the largest volume of Ford GT dealerships! Shut up brain, shut up shutupshutupshutup… Just because I think something doesn’t mean I Vellum Venom it without seeing it in the flesh. The first sentence is a bit superfluous, no? I reckon the U.S.-spec models will roll off the Multimatic Assembly Line first (because ‘Murica!) and all U.S. dealers will have their “certification” ducks in a row faster than any other country. Argh…but when does this nine-month period begin? Granted, we have plenty of classic/specialty car irons in the fire ( First World Problems), but what about TTAC’s loyal readership? They deserve to know! Oh no, there’s a clay model. Those always make me wanna don my car design hat and get all neurotic about car design. I have a problem and (some) people love reading about it! Ordering kit? Barring any surprises to the Ford GT Forum peeps, my brother already knows what he wants. Preferred Selling Dealer/Deliver Location? Done. Extended Color Palette? More on that later. Ordering Appointment? We’re patiently waiting for said window to open. Ya know, how cool would it be for “our concierge” to involve TTAC’s readers via YouTube updates? ’t make Doug our concierge). Actually, that could be pretty awesome! “extended color palette”. The Ford GT Forum mentioned Axalta as Multimatic’s paint supplier, so I spoke to my contact over there. No promises, but they were receptive to making us a one-off color if needed. Probably not brown (sadly), but we could have the ultimate Blue Oval unicorn. ’re on the receiving end of one. If you’ve ever experienced factory tours for vehicles of varying price points, just know that craft builds like the Ford GT won’t work that way. Zuffenhausen ! After all we went through, how dare you turn your back on the lessons learned in car design school?” ’s Brain ’d love to take delivery straight from Multimatic, party in Toronto with TTAC peeps, then drive to Houston in a fully broken-in Ford GT. Coffee Crisps can I fit in the trunk/frunk anyway? But here it rings true on my keyboard, and I reckon that’s true for everyone reading this. ’s? More to the point: Hi, this is your Ford GT concierge! It looks like you’re trying to drive into a lake , can we assist you?” this page intentionally left blank “?",

      "text": "Why So Much Pessimism in the Auto Industry Last Week? PART 4 OF 5 Is Ford Heading Toward a $9.10 Horizontal Support Level? By John Parker | Nov 7, 2016 3:38 pm EST Ford stock remains negative \nLast Friday, November 4, 2016, Ford (F) stock ended the week on a negative note with a fall of 3.2%, closing at $11.34. The stock has remained bearish in the first three quarters of 2016 due to weakening home market sales and falling margins from its flagship F-Series truck. \nIn 3Q16, Ford stock fell about 4.0%. Its peers ( VCR ) General Motors ( GM ), Fiat Chrysler ( FCAU ), and Toyota Motor ( TM ) rose slightly. Let’s look at Ford’s performance last week and explore key technical levels for the week ahead. This week’s technical levels \nLast month, Ford stock breached the key horizontal support level at $11.95, which was lower than the price on June 27, 2016. This previous support level should act as a key resistance level now, and breaking above this level may initiate fresh buying. \nImmediate support can be seen near the $11.15 level. A breach of that level should open up the possibility of testing a stiff horizontal support at $9.10. Why could the price continue to fall? \nFord released its 3Q16 earnings on October 27, 2016. Its adjusted EPS (earnings per share) was $0.26, which is about 42.0% lower than $0.45 in 3Q15. \nThe company’s shrinking year-over-year revenues, sales volume, and profitability were disappointing for investors.

      "text": "© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Ford Is Pouring Millions Into a New Technology Center \nFord Motor is investing 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in the Indian city of Chennai to develop new products, design mobility solutions, and provide business services. \nDearborn, Michigan-based Ford f , which has already invested over $2 billion in India to date, will hire 3,000 people and bring in 9,000 from other centers in the southern Indian city to staff the facility which will be operational by early 2019, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. \nFord is focusing on emerging markets like India where small, inexpensive yet powerful cars are popular and which is dominated by brands from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co. CEO Mark Fields Says Ford Is A Company With a Soul \nThe center will be the car maker’s second-largest technology setup outside its global headquarters, and will include laboratories and testing facilities for vehicles and components, to enable Ford to test future products in India. Ford opened a technology and research lab in Palo Alto, Calif., in January 2015 with just 15 employees. The lab now employs more than 130 people. That number will double by the end of next year, Ford CEO Mark Fields told Fortune in August. \nWith India expected to become the world’s third-largest market by 2020, according to IHS Automotive, global car makers want a bigger share of the pie. \n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, said in the statement. \nThe new centre will also include teams working on advanced financial analysis and future data analytics, the company said.",

The automaker will invest USD 195 million (about Rs 1,300 crore) and would employ 3,000 workers over the next five years, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford said here today. Ford will also consolidate 9,000 employees from six existing facilities on the 28-acre campus at Old Mahabalipuram Road, Thoraipakkam. \nWith 12,000 employees in total by 2019, the Chennai facility will become the company’s second largest centre of employment globally after Michigan, the US. “Chennai is Ford Motor company’s home away from home (after United States),” he told reporters here. Ford said India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it is also rich in talent, technical expertise and ingenuity. “We have invested more than USD two billion till today. We are announcing new investments here today. \nThis will serve as a hub and the new campus will be environment friendly,” he said. “This new centre will help us attract the best and brightest and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world,” Ford said. The first phase of the new campus is likely to be completed by March 2019, he said. \nThe Global Technology and Business Center in Chennai will become Ford’s third global product development in Asia Pacific and will be part of Ford’s global product development network. As well as housing engineering talent, the campus will be home to employees from IT, finance, accounting, data analytics and manufacturing sector. \nThe centre will employ Indian engineers, scientists and skilled workers and feature a range of laboratories and testing facilities. Ford India witnessed a 25 per cent growth in the domestic market and 40 per cent on the overseas market, Ford Asia Pacific President David Schoch said. “We want to express our deepest gratitude to the Tamil Nadu government and Chief Minister J Jayalalithaa for working with Ford over many years to make this vision a reality”, he said. \nPTI",

The centre, the third one in the Asia Pacific region, will serve as a hub for product development, mobility solutions and business services, said Ford executive chairman Bill Ford in Chennai. \nThe centre, spread across 28 acres, will help consolidate 9,000 employees in all its R&D operations in India, across six facilities, under one roof. Post-consolidation, the campus will employ 12,000 people over a period of five years with fresh hiring of 3,000 engineers, scientists and accounting professionals, among others, said Ford. The Chennai facility will be the second largest centre of employment globally after Dearborn in the US, he added. Addressing mediapersons, he said: “We are bullish about the Indian market. After a lull, we see Ford India is ticking up, thanks to the five new products launched in 2015, including the iconic Mustang. The Indian operations saw a 25% growth in domestic sales and 40% growth in exports so far this year.” \n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility solutions, it is also rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Ford said, adding, “This new tech centre will help us attract intellectuals to be part of a true innovation hub for our future products development.” \nOn the lower sales in the domestic market over the years, he said: “We have gone through some challenging times in India for various reasons. It’s common for any car company in the world. However, with the launch of five new products in 2015, the Indian operations saw pick-up in momentum for Ford vehicles. With exports coming into play a major role, particularly with 70% of total sales, Ford India will become more active in the years to come.” With changing environmental norms across the globe, Ford is focusing on smarter mobility solutions, using greener technologies to ensure safer, secured mobility solutions. The Chennai centre will work on advanced financial analysis, future data analytics and connected vehicles solutions, he added. \nSpeaking to FE on, David L Schoch, president, Ford Asia Pacific, said: “The Indian operations are also witnessing an encouraging trend on powertrain exports. We have created a huge capacity across two plants and this would serve both global, as well as Asia Pacific in particular.” Please Wait while comments are loading... Trending Now ",

REUTERS/Babu/File Photo More By Abhirup Roy MUMBAI (Reuters) - Ford Motor Co (F.N) is investing 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in the Indian city of Chennai to develop new products, design mobility solutions and provide business services. Dearborn, Michigan-based Ford, which has already invested over $2 billion in India till date, will hire 3,000 people and bring in 9,000 from other centers in the southern Indian city to staff the facility which will be operational by early 2019, the company said in a statement on Tuesday. Ford is focusing on emerging markets like India where small, inexpensive yet powerful cars are popular and which is dominated by brands from Maruti Suzuki India Ltd (MRTI.NS) and Hyundai Motor Co <005380.KS>. The center will be the car maker's second-largest technology setup outside its global headquarters, and will include laboratories and testing facilities for vehicles and components, to enable Ford to test future products in India. With India expected to become the world's third-largest market by 2020, according to IHS Automotive, global car makers want a bigger share of the pie. \"India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,\" Bill Ford, executive chairman of Ford, said in the statement. The new center will also include teams working on advanced financial analysis and future data analytics, the company said. (Reporting by Abhirup Roy; Editing by Muralikumar Anantharaman) Reblog",

      "text": "Several years ago, when Linda Childers' Ford sedan was totaled, her insurance company offered her a low-ball settlement offer. \"A friend who worked in the auto repair industry suggested that I look online for cars that were the same model, mileage [and] condition as mine and see what they were being sold for,\" says Childers, a writer based in the San Francisco Bay Area. \"In doing this, I was able to get the price my insurance company was offering me increased by several thousand dollars,\" she explains. Still, the payout wasn't enough to buy her another vehicle , and she wound up leasing for a couple of years until she could buy. \n[See: 10 Money Leaks to Shut Down Now .] \nChilders isn't alone. \"If you feel the amount offered for your totaled vehicle is not enough -- and it's not unusual for an insurer to start with a low offer -- don't take it, and instead negotiate,\" says Penny Gusner, a consumer analyst for insurance comparison websites Insure.com and CarInsurance.com. \"To get more for your car, you'll need to prove it's worth more,\" Gusner adds. \nBut first, what does it mean when a car is totaled? \n\"A totaled car is a vehicle that's in need of extensive repairs costing more than a set percentage of the vehicle's value,\" says Matt Smith, an editor at used car listing website CarGurus.com. This percentage varies by state (for instance, Iowa's standard threshold is 50 percent, while Texas' is 100), but insurers can choose to set a lower loss threshold than the state's standard. Typically, the percentage falls around 70 percent. \n\"When you file your claim , your insurance company will refer you to a claims adjuster,\" explains Loretta Worters, vice president of communications at the Insurance Information Institute, which aims to improve public understanding of insurance. \"The adjuster will verify the loss and determine what it will cost to repair the car. The adjuster's estimate can serve as a benchmark to which to compare your own mechanic's estimate,\" she says. \nHowever, even if your insurer considers your vehicle a total loss, you can choose to release your insurance company from its obligations, have the car repaired yourself and continue driving it or sell it for parts rather than accept a settlement. \"If the goal is to stay on the road, taking the payout on a low-value car might not net you enough cash to replace your damaged vehicle,\" Smith says. \"Rather than taking the payout and then immediately spending it (and then some) on a replacement car, you could opt instead to repair the damage.\" Or, the value of the car's parts might be greater than the value offered by the insurance company and you could sell it for parts or as is. \n\"Much of this decision will boil down to the car's value ,\" Smith says. \"If your $45,000 Grand Cherokee is totaled, it will almost certainly make the most sense to take the insurance company's payout. If the cost of your deductible is equal to a significant portion of your car's value, then it may make more sense to release the insurance company from its responsibility and handle the repairs yourself.\" \n[Read: The Financial Considerations of Buying Your Teenager a Car .] \nIf you still have an outstanding loan on a car that's totaled, then hopefully you also have gap insurance. \"Gap insurance will pay the difference between the actual cash value paid by the insurer and what is still owed on your loan minus your deductible amount,\" Gusner says. \"Otherwise, you'll be left to pay on a car you no longer have.\" \nInsurers won't give you a higher actual cash value simply because you have an outstanding loan . But other factors can help you get a higher offer. Here's how to negotiate for the best price. \nVerify that your insurer used accurate information. \"Make certain the settlement offer was based on the correct model with all of the correct options you had on your vehicle,\" Gusner says. \"If not, point that out and see if the offer is raised.\" \nCheck local dealers. Gusner suggests going to local dealers to \"see if you can get documentation on what they say your car would have been worth.\" However, if you're not honest about the condition of your car pre-accident, your insurer may not take your estimate seriously. \nSearch the local classifieds. Car values can vary by geography, so Sarah Lee Marks, president of Automotive Business Services, the parent company for several of her auto-related ventures, and the author behind the car service site MyCarLady.com, discourages people from doing a national eBay search, as that can skew results. \"Try Craigslist under for sale by owner only,\" she says. \"This is a realistic way to evaluate the offer and appreciate how rare or common your vehicle is, when trying to replace it,\" Marks adds. \nShow your service records. Save your service records as this can help you make the case for a higher settlement offer. \"Demonstrate value by offering recent service records from the last three months, or tire, brake and major services purchased in the past six months,\" Marks says. \"This value should add to the settlement before tax.\" (In some states, you can get a sales tax credit on the trade-in of a used car, but if your car is totaled, you miss out on the chance to trade it in.) \nA few other factors also come into play. \"Time with the insurance company does weigh in your favor, as does their loss ratios for your area of the country,\" Marks says. Those aren't elements that you can control once you're in an accident, but Marks suggests choosing a top-rated insurer rather than the one with the cheapest premiums for this reason. \"Nobody expects to have a total loss, but picking the right insurance company can work in your favor when it comes to negotiating that loss,\" she adds. \n[Read: Should You Trade in Your Car or Sell It Yourself? ] \nDon't be afraid to negotiate if you think your insurer isn't offering a fair value. \"You're entitled to the market price of the car you just lost,\" Worters says. \"You shouldn't get more or less than what you are due,\" she adds. \n\n\nMore From US News & World Report \n10 Unexpected Costs of Driving \n11 Ways to Save Time and Money \n8 Big Budgeting Blunders -- and How to Fix Them",

Posted 10 Nov 2016 00:25 The Ford logo is seen at their plant in Cuatitlan Izcalli, Mexico October 18, 2016. REUTERS/Carlos Jasso A \nWASHINGTON: No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co , which has endured scathing criticism from Donald Trump over its Mexican investments, on Wednesday congratulated him on his election victory and vowed to work with the president-elect. \n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country, and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. \nTrump repeatedly said during the campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on Ford vehicles. \nFord shares dropped 2.6 percent to US$11.18 on Wednesday. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest US$2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs. \nAt his campaign kickoff speech in June 2015, Trump said he would call Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields to explain the \"bad news.\" \n\"Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax,\" Trump said then. \nEarlier this year, Ford said it will invest US$1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico. \nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\" \nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested US$12 billion in the United States since 2011. \nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees (US$195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe) - Reuters",

In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico. \nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\" \nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested $12 billion in the United States since 2011. \nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe) Loading...

In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico. \nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\" \nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested $12 billion in the United States since 2011. \nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees (£156.73 million) over the next five years in a technology and business centre in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019. \n(Reporting by David Shepardson; Editing by Chizu Nomiyama and Jeffrey Benkoe) Loading...

      "text": "Ford vows to work with Trump after criticism of Mexico investments The Ford logo is seen at their plant in Cuatitlan Izcalli, Mexico. Photo: Reuters Published: 11:30 PM, November 9, 2016 Updated: 1:30 AM, November 10, 2016 \nWASHINGTON - No. 2 U.S. automaker Ford Motor Co <F.N>, which has endured scathing criticism from Donald Trump over its Mexican investments, on Wednesday congratulated him on his election victory and vowed to work with the president-elect. \n\"We agree with Mr. Trump that it is really important to unite the country, and we look forward to working together to support economic growth and jobs,\" Ford spokeswoman Christin Baker said. \nTrump repeatedly said during the campaign that if elected he would not allow Ford to open a new plant in Mexico and would slap hefty tariffs taxes on Ford vehicles. \nFord shares dropped 2.6 percent to $11.18 on Wednesday. \nFord said in April 2015 it planned to invest $2.5 billion to build two new plants in Mexico, adding 3,800 jobs. \nAt his campaign kickoff speech in June 2015, Trump said he would call Ford Chief Executive Officer Mark Fields to explain the \"bad news.\" \n\"Let me give you the bad news: Every car, every truck and every part manufactured in this plant that comes across the border, we’re going to charge you a 35 percent tax,\" Trump said then. \nEarlier this year, Ford said it will invest $1.6 billion in Mexico for small-car production to start in 2018. In September, Ford confirmed that all of the company's small-car production will leave U.S. plants and head to lower-cost Mexico. \nIn his final speech of the campaign early on Election Day in western Michigan, Trump returned to the theme. \"After we win, I'm going to be coming back to Michigan a lot. I'm going to be coming back every time we open a new factory or a new automobile plant ... We're not going to lose your jobs anymore,\" Trump said. \"We are going to bring back the automobile industry to Michigan, bigger and better and stronger than ever before.\" \nLast month, Ford Executive Chairman Bill Ford Jr. said he had met with Trump to talk about his extensive criticism of the automaker's investments in Mexico. Ford noted the automaker has hired 26,000 and invested $12 billion in the United States since 2011. \nBill Ford was in India on Wednesday after the company announced it will invest 13 billion rupees ($195 million) over the next five years in a technology and business center in Chennai. Ford said it will hire 3,000 people to staff the facility, which will be operational by early 2019. REUTERS",

      "text": "Safety is our highest concern.\nYou've heard that, right?\nFord built the compact Pinto for about 15 years starting in the1970s. Ford said it was safe. It wasn't. It caught fire easier than a Weber Gas Grill.\nAs Time magazine reported, this was not news to Ford engineers and CPAs who did an internal cost/benefit analysis of how much fixing the pyrotechnics would cost ($121 million) versus the cost of payouts to victims ($50 million). As the paper trail later proved, Ford decided institutionally to let people burn because it was cheaper.\nDrivers of the most dangerous car in American automotive history didn't assume it was exploding lemon, because who in their right mind would build an unsafe car deliberately?\nIf the cars flipped, spun and blew up, that must be bad driving, or unknown factors and conditions beyond anyone's control.\nRationalization is shameless.\nPinto was the child of cost benefit analysis. Perhaps unintentionally, Indiana government also decided how much protecting Brandon Beau Dewayne Fiscus would have cost.\nIt would cost too much.\nSo a local driver plowed through an I-65 construction site near Hobart last month and killed the 35-year-old Fiscus.\nConstruction worker killed in I-65 crash Michelle L. Quinn A construction worker from LaPorte was killed Wednesday morning after a woman lost control of her vehicle in a construction zone on northbound Interstate 65.\nIn a press release, Indiana State Police spokeswoman Sgt. Ann Wojas said a 23-year-old Merrillville woman was driving her 2013 GMC SUV approximately...\nA construction worker from LaPorte was killed Wednesday morning after a woman lost control of her vehicle in a construction zone on northbound Interstate 65.\nIn a press release, Indiana State Police spokeswoman Sgt. Ann Wojas said a 23-year-old Merrillville woman was driving her 2013 GMC SUV approximately...\n(Michelle L. Quinn) Not that it means much to Fiscus now, but determining how much his death might cost Indiana is not based on emotions any more than \"E = MC Squared\" is emotional.\nThe standard rate for government employees who die in circumstances similar to those that claimed Fiscus is about $2 million.\nThat sounds like a lot, but the number comprises insurance, legal liability and accounts for family grief and his suffering. The number assumes a random and unpreventable accident.\nIn the most generous view, every accident on I-65 is a bad break for someone. But it's no surprise.\nSomewhere inside the Indiana DOT — just as Ford documented — there likely is a cost-benefit-risk assessment that details the price to make I-65 safe enough that it won't kill you.\nIt's too much. Nothing would make I-65 truly safe except a massive redesigned reconstruction. But shutting down I-65 long enough to make it safe would violate INDOT \"policy.\" The trucks must flow.\nGary man killed in crash exiting I-65 in Lake County A Gary man was killed Friday night when he lost control of his car as he was exiting Interstate 65, the Indiana State Police said.\nJohn J. Gondell, 48, of the 600 block of West 51st Street, was trying to exit from southbound I-65 at U.S. 231 at about 10:05 p.m. when he failed to make the curve...\nA Gary man was killed Friday night when he lost control of his car as he was exiting Interstate 65, the Indiana State Police said.\nJohn J. Gondell, 48, of the 600 block of West 51st Street, was trying to exit from southbound I-65 at U.S. 231 at about 10:05 p.m. when he failed to make the curve...\nRead the story So I-65 lives on.\nThere are statistical measurements of I-65's danger.\nInterstate 65 is the 12th deadliest highway in the country, easily the deadliest per driver mile in Indiana and has been for years.\nThat estimation comes from FARS, the Fatality Analysis Reporting System of the National Traffic and Highway Safety Administration. The study assessed the past five years (2011-15) and counted the number of accidents that occurred on every highway in the United States to identify fatal accident trends.\nInterstate 65 rings the bell at No. 12, with 36.5 deaths per 100 miles. I-65 is 887 miles from Gary to the Gulf Coast and had 324 deaths during the period.\nBut Indiana's share of risk is not comparatively high. Between 2004 and 2008, the road's 261 miles inside the state hosted 157 fatal accidents, but 50 state slices of other Interstates are more perilous.\nI-64 which skims across Indiana's east-west southern tier ranks No. 22. The 954-mile highway had 238 deaths during the period, for a rate of 25.0 per 100 miles.\nNo. 1 on the list is state route 99 in California, with 62.3 deaths per 100 miles.\nThe cost-benefit analysis that valued Fiscus is not based only on the road's safety alone, but who travels on it. Though 100,000 \"vehicles\" travel I-65 in Lake County every day, a high percentage are trucks being funneled through Chicago. If you divert civilian drivers, it's an inconvenience.\nWhen you divert long-haul truckers, it costs money.\nFiscus might have died because his employer, E&B Paving, used plastic safety barrels on the northbound shoulder to protect workers rather than more expensive concrete barriers.\nJasmine Tirado, 23, of Merrillville drove her SUV through the barrels and into Fiscus.\nNot our fault, INDOT says.\nAs state spokesman Matthew Deitchley pithily noted: \"INDOT oversees and ensures the work zone meets safety requirements for the traveling public, but the safety of contractor workers and any decisions about work zone safety equipment for workers is ultimately the decision of the contractor.\"\nMoney sometimes defines safety. The state decided on Oct. 13 to let highway contractors add safety features such as concrete barriers without counting the expense against the approved budget.\nThat didn't help Fiscus.\nHe was killed 24 hours earlier.\nDavid Rutter was an editor for 40 years at six newspapers.\nDavid.rutter@live.com\n ",

      "text": "EarthRoamers Are What You Want When You Grow Up Assuming your 401k is healthy. Ford EarthRoamer \nAs you’re probably aware, the abbreviation, RV, is short for “recreational vehicle” but unfortunately there’s hardly ever any real recreation involved in those unwieldy behemoths. For me, the term RV evokes thoughts of being car sick on long highway travels, “camping” in glorified parking lots that just happened to be near a couple pine trees and not being able to go number two even though there’s clearly a bathroom back there. The only adventure and excitement associated with RVs is accidently backing into picnic tables. \nAnd although there were plenty of old farts with legit retirement funds on deck, for a long time there was a serious void in the RV world. The number of people yearning to experience true adventure while retaining the comforts of home was real and thankfully, EarthRoamer stepped up over a decade ago to transform the adventure travel landscape forever. EarthRoamer \nEarthRoamer is a Colorado-based outfitter that builds the most capable, yet comfortable off-road XVs (Xpedition Vehicles) on the planet that can pretty much tackle any terrain you throw at it. The company has been around officially since 2003 but became a bit more mainstream in the last five years or so with the help of social media. It didn’t hurt that high-profile clients like singe, John Mayer started purchasing them, too. This particular post garnered over 77,000 likes and almost 5,000 comments and was actually how I first found the EarthRoamer brand. \nEarthRoamer currently sells one model, the XV-LT , which is based on the Ford F550 chassis. It has the PowerStroke 6.7L turbo diesel under the hood which has plenty of power to propel such a massive machine. So what exactly do you get for a half-a-million? The walk around video below illustrates it best: \nAnd as if the massive XV-LT wasn’t massive enough, Earthroamer has it’s bigger sibling, the 2017 XV-HD currently in production. EarthRoamer EarthRoamer EarthRoamer \nThe XV-HD is based on the larger Ford F-750 chassis, has the same powerplant and basically bigger everything else with a price tag of right under one million dollars .",

      "text": "*Who could have seen this coming*? Just weeks after Ford idled four factories due to slumping sales and excess inventory, GM just followed by *slashing 2000 jobs permanently and suspending a third shift at production facilities in early 2017*.\n\nWe have warned numerous times that there is only one way this ends...\n\n\nAnd so it just did...\n\n*GM Statement:*\n\n\n\nGeneral Motors today announced initiatives to* strengthen and align its production output at key U.S. manufacturing operations*. The plans include investing more than $900 million in three facilities — Toledo Transmission Operations in Ohio, Lansing Grand River in Michigan and Bedford Casting Operations in Indiana — to prepare the facilities for future product programs.\n\n\nGM also announced plans to align production output with demand for cars built at the Lordstown, Ohio, and Lansing Grand River, Michigan, assembly plants. *As the customer shift from cars to crossovers and trucks is projected to continue, GM will suspend the third shift of production at both facilities in the first quarter of 2017. *\n\n\n\n*The Lordstown plant builds the compact Chevrolet Cruze, whose U.S. sales through October were down 20 percent. *The Lansing Grand River plant builds the Cadillac ATS and CTS, whose sales were down 17 percent through October.\n\nAnd Reuters confirms, *General Motors Co plans to lay off 2,000 employees at two U.S. auto plants in early 2017, the automaker said on Wednesday.*\n\n*As for the first time since 2009, auto inventories have declined YoY...*\n\n* * *\n\nAs Gavekal Capital blog's Eric Bush notes, *there are a lot of disruptions taking place in the auto industry.*\n\n\n\nUber, Lyft and many smaller regional competitors are driving taxi drivers crazy and have made it easier than ever to get around without owning a vehicle.\n\n\nCompanies like Car2Go, Zipcar, (and BMW?) give consumers the freedom to drive while not having to worry about having car insurance or a car payment.\n\n\nTuro even makes it easy to rent out your car Airbnb-style which helps many owners make some money from their depreciating asset that usually goes unused 95% of the time.\n\n\nAnd on top of this a driverless revolution is seemingly on its way.\n\n\n\nThis dire news (at least from the prospective of an auto company) leads us to our chart of the day which shows* the amount of of money spent on motor vehicles as a percentage of disposable income and as a percentage of GDP*.\n\n\n*The good news* is that in both cases these series are above 2008 lows.\n\n*The bad news*, however, is that the cyclical rebound looks like it may be over and spending on cars is topping out below prior cyclical lows in in 1970, 1974, 1980 and 2005.\n\n*Whenever the next recession hits, its not hard to imagine 2008 lows being taken out.*",

When complete in 2019, the Chennai campus, with some 12,000 employees, will become Ford’s second-largest employment centre behind its Dearborn, Mich., campus, which is undergoing a massive, 10-year renovation. \nThe India site will house engineers, IT, finance, accounting, data analytics and manufacturing engineering. Ford said it will include a wide range of labs and testing facilities for complete vehicle and component testing. \n“India is not only a vibrant market for cars and new mobility ideas, it also is rich with talent, technical expertise and ingenuity,” Executive Chairman Bill Ford said in a statement. “This new centre will help us attract the best and brightest, and make Chennai a true hub of innovation for Ford around the world.” \nThe Chennai site will be Ford’s third global product development centre in the Asia Pacific region, and will be Ford’s second-largest IT organization outside of the company’s headquarters. \nThe site will feature 2.5 million square feet (232,257 square metres) of floor space. It will include three office buildings, a learning and development centre, a canteen and a product development centre. \nAll buildings will include LED lights, solar panels, and a water treatment plant and rainwater tanks. Other amenities include a fitness centre, yoga centre, medical facilities and a child care centre, Ford said. You can reach Michael Martinez at Tags: ",

      "text": "Trump versus Machines: What to Expect in the Auto Industry PART 2 OF 5 Ford versus Trump: What Options Does the Company Have? By John Parker | Nov 10, 2016 8:56 am EST Ford versus Trump \nFord Motor Company (F) has been targeted repeatedly by Donald Trump since the beginning of his presidential campaign. Trump argued that Ford is responsible for taking away jobs from the US due to its new investments in Mexico. Now that Trump won the presidential election, let’s find out what options the company has moving forward. We’ll also explore how these options will impact Ford’s business in the future. Investments in Mexico \nIn April 2016, Ford revealed its intentions to invest $1.6 billion in a new small car manufacturing facility in Mexico. The new plant will likely create around 2,800 additional direct jobs by 2020 in the region. The company expects the production line to be operational in 2018. \nDuring his campaign, Donald Trump clearly stated his intention to slap a 35% tax on cars manufactured by Ford in Mexico when they’re brought to the US for sale. What options does Ford have? \nIt’s clear that Ford has very few options. First, the company might want to try convincing Trump on why investments in Mexico are critical for its business to survive. It’s important to note that small cars tend to have lower margins for automakers ( VCR ) compared to other heavyweight vehicles including trucks and utility vehicles. \nIf Trump maintains his tough stance, things could get worse for Ford. While Ford is already struggling with declining profitability , any move by Trump to penalize it could hurt the company’s small car business. \nNote that Ford is the second-largest US automaker by volume behind General Motors ( GM ). Both of the companies face stiff competition in the US small car segment from Japanese auto giants like Toyota ( TM ) and Honda (HMC). \nIn the next part, we’ll look at what Trump’s victory might mean for other mainstream automakers. {\"metrics\":[\"Open\"],\"tickers\":[\"F\",\"GM\",\"HMC\",\"TM\",\"VCR\"],\"ticker_names\":[\"Ford Motor Company\",\"General Motors Company\",null,null,\"Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF\"]} X",

      "text": "By : Adrian Padeanu , Editor Ford has been selling the subcompact crossover for years, but it's only now the EcoSport is ready for America. \nSpotted testing in U.S. guise many months ago, the EcoSport is about to receive its much-awaited stateside debut scheduled to occur on Monday ahead of the 2016 Los Angeles Auto Show. The announcement was made by a Ford spokesman in an interview with Automotive News , but it’s unclear at this point when the subcompact crossover will effectively go on sale in the United States. A report coming from research firm Autodata indicates the vehicle, which is going to be positioned below the Escape, will be available towards the end of 2017 as a 2018 model year. \nIt will be interesting to find out which Ford factory will be in charge of manufacturing the EcoSport in U.S. specification. The model is currently being assembled in Brazil, India, Thailand, and in Russia, while the company’s factory in Craiova, Romania will begin assembly of an upgraded version in the fall of 2017. \nBased on the outgoing Fiesta, the EcoSport is available with an assortment of gasoline and diesel engines depending on where it’s being sold. Units include a turbocharged 1.0-liter three-cylinder mill from the EcoBoost family and naturally-aspirated 1.5-, 1.6- and 2.0-liter gasoline engines joined by a thriftier 1.5-liter TDCi diesel. Most of them are sending their outputs to the front axle, but the 2.0-liter for example can be hooked up to an all-wheel drive setup. The grippier version will likely be offered in the U.S. taking into account the version spotted by our spies had the \"4WD\" logo. \nIt remains to be seen which of these engines will power the American model , although we have our doubts the diesel will be available. \nThere’s no word about pricing just yet, but needless to say it will considerably undercut the $23,600 Escape, so we are expecting somewhere in the region of a sub-$20k starting price for the crossover-ized Fiesta. \nSource: Ford via Automotive News Be part of something big Ford EcoSport facelift spied in the U.S. About this article",

      "text": "Autoblog Staff What happens when an engineer can't get a car to a wind tunnel for testing? Ford's solution is to bring the tunnel to the car . On this episode of Translogic , host Jonathon Buckley tours Ford's labs and factories to see what innovations they have brewing for the future. Bucko starts his tour at a testing site learning about Ford's portable wind tunnels. Interestingly, these tools aren't necessarily used for decreasing wind resistance to gain speed, but rather they're used to find unpleasant wind noise you'd hear while driving. The giant fans are housed in portable shipping containers, which makes the tool incredibly convenient for engineers to move across the country. \"We can put one of those right on a standard flatbed and haul it across the country within hours,\" says Mark Wiles, wind noise engineer at Ford. Another tool that's used closely in conjunction with the wind tunnels is Ford's binaural mannequin head microphones. These mics give a three-dimensional audio picture of where exacly noise is coming from and allow engineers to analyze the recorded sound in several different ways. The last stop on our tour is Ford's wearables lab. Engineers at Ford Motor Company have started looking into the potential applications of wearables for drivers and are currently experimenting with some of the hottest smartwatches on the market. Ford is not just looking at how smartwatches impact driver experience, but also how smarthwatch technology could be potentially embedded into the vehicle itself.

      "text": "N ixon built an underground bowling alley , Ford added an outdoor swimming pool , while Obama installed basketball hoops on the Bush’s tennis court. But the White House preservation committee must be trembling with trepidation at what real-estate tycoon and voracious builder Donald Trump plans to unleash on his new Washington DC home.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nixon displays his bowling skills. Photograph: Bettmann Archive \nSince Thomas Jefferson replaced the outdoor privy with modern flushing loos, and commissioned Benjamin Latrobe to smarten up the humble house with rows of classical colonnades , it has been the done thing for the incoming first family to make their mark on the president’s official residence.\n\nJackie Kennedy set the tone for the first lady’s role as homemaker to the nation, masterminding a comprehensive renovation of the White House in 1961. She enlisted famed socialite decorator Sister Parish and French designer Stéphane Boudin to fill the house with antique wallpaper panels and swagged drapery, wrought with a stage-set theatricality that climaxed in her blue silk dressing room, replete with a button-tufted chaise longue and leopard skin throw.\nFrom the Kennedys onwards, the White House became a public stage for the first family to construct their identity, and on which an ideal domesticity would be played out. Nancy Reagan enlisted Beverly Hills interior designer Ted Graber to deliver a dose of 1980s Hollywood glamour, filling the dressing room with peachy floral fabrics, swamping her office in a symphony of pistachio and lining the bedroom walls with hand-painted chinoiserie wallpaper. \n\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Nancy Reagan poses in the White House’s red room in 1981. Photograph: Horst P Horst/Conde Nast/Getty Images \nLaura Bush brought in Ken Blasingame , designer of the Bush’s Texan ranches, to install lavish hand-blocked wallpaper and marble chimneypieces, while the Obamas have been as cool and restrained as you might expect. They replaced Bush’s loud sunburst carpet in the Oval Office with a simple cream affair and filled the house with an unprecedented array of modern and contemporary art, hanging paintings by Josef Albers and Robert Rauschenberg and sculptures by native and African American artists – as well as replacing a Churchill bust with Martin Luther King .\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Works by Robert Rauschenberg (L) and Alma Thomas, the first African American female artist represented in the White House. Photograph: Michael Mundy/AP \nSo what treats might Donald and Melania have in store? A peek inside their three-storey, 53-room penthouse home at the top of Trump Tower suggests the dial will be turned back a few centuries – and that, along with ramping up coal extraction , they might have to reopen the gold mines.\nCeilings heave with gilded mouldings, chandeliers groan with torrents of crystal, a weight of opulence supported by forests of fluted marble columns topped with gilded Corinthian capitals. Every surface is embellished and encrusted, from ceiling paintings depicting scenes from Greek mythology to the velvet cushions emblazoned with the Trump coat of arms. A fountain cascades in front of a back-lit wall of onyx, while a bronze Eros and Psyche cavort on the coffee table; Greek vases teeter on the mantlepiece, above a miniature Mercedes, in which his 10-year-old son Barron can roam around this mini Versailles. It makes Liberace look like a minimalist.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Inside Trump Tower. Photograph: Sipa Press/Rex/Shutterstock \nIt is the gaudy concoction of the late American decorator Angelo Donghia – aka “the Saint Laurent of sofas” – purveyor of gilded fantasies to the stars, from Ralph Lauren to Liza Minnelli. With Donghia gone, Trump might do well to consult Peter York’s book Dictator’s Homes , a manual of oligarch chic.\nOr perhaps he will take inspiration from his own Florida palace, Mar-a-Lago , the most extravagant of the jazz age mansions in Palm Beach, which he bought in 1985. With 58 bedrooms, 33 bathrooms and a 15-metre (50ft) dining room with a pietra dura marble table (as well as three handy bomb shelters), it reads like an encyclopedia of interior decor, moving from perpendicular gothic to American federal to a bedroom with hand-painted fairytale scenes. A portrait of Trump in a tennis sweater hangs over the bar, his blond hair billowing beneath a fiery red sky.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The dining room at Mar-a-Lago. Photograph: Davis/Hall/Rex/Shutterstock \nDC beware. A fantasyland of terracotta turrets and marble toilets will soon be on its way to make the White House great again, no doubt accompanied by a 20ft-high Trump bolted on the roof.",

      "text": "Published on November 10th, 2016 | by Steve Hanley 0 November 10th, 2016 by Steve Hanley \nFord’s smallest SUV, the EcoSport, is coming to America. Its styling has been updated a bit from the current version of the car sold in South America, Asia, and Europe, but it will still look like a smaller version of the Ford C-Max. The diesel engine offered in Europe probably won’t make it to America but the US will most likely get at least two of the three engines available on the Continent — a 1.6 liter 120 horsepower four cylinder, a 1.0 liter three cylinder EcoBoost turbo making 123 horsepower, or a 2.0 liter four cylinder that has 160 horsepower. This year’s LA auto show kicks off November 18. \nThe EcoSport is a small crossover SUV built on Ford’s global “B” architecture which is shared with the Fiesta. Originally developed as a simple and inexpensive SUV for emerging markets, the EcoSport was first built in Brazil. Since then, production has expanded to China, Russia, India, Vietnam, and Thailand. Ford sold more than a quarter million EcoSport cute utes worldwide in 2015. The EcoSport is said to have a towing capacity of more than 1,500 pounds in European trim, so it should be suitable for hauling small camping trailers and boats on vacation. \nIn size, the EcoSport will compete with the likes of the Buick Encore, Honda HR-V, Chevy Trax, and Nissan Juke. Americans are buying a lot of those compact SUVs, which are easier to maneuver than a full luxobarge like the Chevy Suburban. Sales of smaller SUVs are up dramatically of late and Ford obviously wants a piece of the action. Source: The Automakers. Data through October 31. 2016 \nThe EcoSport for the US market will likely be built at Ford’s Cuautitlan Stamping and Assembly plant in Cuautitlan Izcalli, Mexico. That’s where the Ford Fiesta for the US market is manufactured. Another possibility is Ford’s assembly plant in Thailand. The date for the start of sales in the US has not yet been announced. Pricing details are also unknown, although The Motley Fool suggests a base model might sell for around $20,000 with a fully equipped Titanium version costing $26,000 or so. Ford may make more details available during the LA show next week. \nPhoto credit: Ford Motor Company. 2016 European model shown. Share:",

Posted 10 Nov 2016 22:15 Updated 11 Nov 2016 01:10 Scotland's Ross Ford during training. Rugby Union - Scotland Training - Surrey Sports Park - 14/10/15. Action Images via Reuters / Andrew Boyers Livepic A \nLONDON: Hooker Ross Ford will become the third player to reach 100 caps for Scotland when he spearheads a new-look front row against Australia on Saturday. \nFord, who made his debut against Australia 12 years ago, will join Chris Paterson (109) and Sean Lamont (105) as centurions when Vern Cotter's side open their autumn campaign at Murrayfield. \nHis experience could prove vital as he will line up alongside debutant Allan Dell and Zander Fagerson who makes his first international start. \n\"To play 100 test matches for your country is an incredible achievement, with his lasting dedication keeping him among the best hookers in the world for a decade,\" coach Cotter said in a statement. \n\"He is a consummate professional and, at 32, he has plenty left to give in a Scotland jersey.\" \nFlanker Hamish Watson and centre Huw Jones will also make their first test starts as Scotland face Australia for the first time since their heartbreaking 35-34 defeat in the World Cup quarter-finals last year. \nThat match holds painful memories for Cotter's side who were on the verge of a stunning upset before Australia snatched victory with a last-gasp penalty by Bernard Foley that many observers felt should not have been awarded. \nCotter said it would be a \"trap\" for Scotland to go into Saturday's match looking for revenge. \n\"It's another game, it's a year on,\" he added. \"There were things we took from that game that we felt we could use to become better and improve. \n\"One of those traps you can fall into is work on the principle of revenge. There's determination anyway.\" \nTeam: 15-Stuart Hogg, 14-Sean Maitland, 13-Huw Jones, 12-Alex Dunbar, 11-Tim Visser, 10-Finn Russell, 9-Greig Laidlaw, 1-Allan Dell, 2-Ross Ford, 3-Zander Fagerson, 4-Richie Gray, 5-Jonny Gray, 6-John Barclay, 7-Hamish Watson, 8-Ryan Wilson \nReplacements: 16-Fraser Brown, 17-Gordon Reid, 18-Moray Low, 19-Grant Gilchrist, 20-John Hardie, 21-Ali Price, 22-Pete Horne, 23-Rory Hughes. \n(Reporting by Toby Davis, editing by Pritha Sarkar) - Reuters",

      "text": "Home » News » Ford’s recipes for accident prevention Ford’s recipes for accident prevention On 12:29 am In Motoring , News by Tony Comments \nBy Theodore Opara \nWe’ve all been there – traffic jams, inconsi-derate drivers, bad weather and potholes – dealing with poor road conditions and heavy traffic can quickly make you feel stressed. \nKnowing how to handle these situations is important to managing your stress levels and helps ensure you arrive safely at your destination. Getting emotionally worked up rarely leaves us feeling any better – it just passes on the frustration to another driver and spreads the road rage. \nInstead, consider having a game plan before you even get into your car, and know what you have to do to help avoid frustration once you’re in the thick of things. \nAccording to Derek Kirby, Training Director at Driving Skills for Life, DSFL, South Africa, the majority of Nigerian drivers have been on the receiving end of some form of road rage in the past. He points out that even drivers who consider themselves to be very calm admit to showing signs of road rage on occasion. \nDSFL is a driving skills programme for newly-licensed drivers, as well as a means of improving the defensive driving ability of experienced drivers. It is funded by the not-for-profit Ford Motor Company Fund as an effective method of improving driving skills globally and so contributing to road safety. The programme focuses on defensive driving techniques that include dealing with – and avoiding – road rage. \nAllow Time for Delays \nThis may seem like a no-brainer, but failing to give yourself a bit of breathing room when travelling to work or social engagements can create unnecessary stress, so allow time for unexpected delays. Make a habit of listening to traffic reports in order to avoid congested areas. If you do get stuck in traffic, however, the best advice is to relax and turn up the music. Getting worked up won’t get you to your destination faster – and may even result in an accident. If you’ve allowed some time for a delay it will significantly reduce your traffic-jam stress. \nGet some rest \nDriving while tired can be stressful and dangerous. Getting a good night’s sleep before hitting the road is a good step towards staying calm and in charge on the road. It’s just as important to rest regularly along the way of your trip. Certain Ford vehicles have alert systems that will keep track of your driving behaviour and alert you to take a rest if they sense you are starting to drift from side to side – a potential sign of driver fatigue. \nSound mind, sound ride \nYour car should always remind you why it’s awesome to drive. The right playlist or the right radio station can help fend off stress and frustration in a traffic jam. At a reasonable volume, this can help make the drive more pleasant and help you stay calm. \nDrive smoothly \nIf burning fuel (and your money) is stressing you out as you sit idle in traffic, remember that smooth driving can help decrease fuel consumption. There’s no reason to rush five metres forward only to stop again. Accelerating and braking smoothly in stop-start traffic helps make your tank go farther. \n“When approaching a red light or a slow-down in traffic use your vehicle’s momentum and built up energy by taking your foot off the accelerator pedal early. Try and roll with stop-start traffic as smoothly as possible. Also try to change lanes early when approaching obstacles or turn-offs and always use your indicators. This will make you a smoother driver and help you avoid a number of situations that can result in road rage. It may also save you money on fuel in the long run,” says Derek.",

      "text": "It’s all style. Think about it: Kennedy over Nixon. Reagan over Carter. Carter over Ford. Bush over Dukakis. Clinton over Bush. Obama over Romney. Even given substantive differences, style played a big part in the outcome of those elections.\nAnd now, the horrifying culmination of this phenomenon: Trump over Clinton.\nThe analyses show that rural voters came out in force for Trump, that nonwhites didn’t come out strongly enough for Clinton, that people wanted “change”, that Trump was seen as better for the economy.\nReally?\nIt’s all style over substance. Again, think about it: Was there one Trump policy that he could actually articulate—not only what the policy was but also how it could be implemented? Was there one stance he took that was consistent over several years (leaving aside the stances he took that he changed by the day)? Was there any evidence at all that he knew what he was talking about, whether it concerned domestic or foreign policy? Does he know how Medicare is implemented? Can he find Crimea on a map?\nThe lesson of this election has nothing to do with substance and everything to do with style. Too many people in this country were swayed by Trump’s persona: His “tell-it-like-it-is” manner, even if he wasn’t telling it like it was. His boasting. His cruel, puerile putdowns. His repetitious phrasing. His lies—his continual, in-your-face lies.\nPeople liked that. It was a stark contrast to standard politicians’ verbiage. It was black-and-white, simple, easy to understand—never mind if it wasn’t close to being accurate. And also never mind if the real world isn’t always black-and-white, simple, easy to understand. These people think that the solution to Middle East violence is to bomb the bad guys—whoever they are, wherever they are, whatever the consequences are to the innocents who are in the way or the countries that will be brought into the war. These people think that the solution to domestic violence is to give everyone a gun—everyone, of course, except immigrants, many of whom will be deported. These people think that the solution to poverty is to cut taxes, regardless of who is then going to pay for infrastructure, defense, Social Security, and other services. Complexity, compromise, reflection—these are taboo.\nIt’s all style. If Donald Trump had the quiet demeanor of, say, Ben Carson, I think that Clinton would have won by 70%-30%. If Donald Trump had the deliberate talking cadence of Barack Obama—without Obama’s wit, kindness, and deep knowledge of issues—I think that Clinton would have won by 70%-30%. And if Donald Trump had the identical personality of Hillary Clinton, I think that Clinton would have won by at least 70%-30%.\nPeople wanted a boor, and they got one. They didn’t care about policy or experience or ability or knowledge or judgment. On the other hand, they did care about temperament; they truly appreciate Trump’s temperament. He’s just like them: He gets angry and says rude things. He changes his mind a lot. He lies when it’s convenient. He seeks revenge on people who he perceives have done him wrong. And he’s profane. Millions of people see themselves in the new President.\nAnd that is what should concern us. It’s not that Trump is an asshole; there will always be assholes, some of whom will become President. What should concern us is that people recognize that assholicity, they relate to it, and they want that in the person who will lead them in the next four years.\nThis election wasn’t about socialism vs. conservatism, or isolationism vs. heavy participation in foreign affairs. And it wasn’t about religious bias or racism or misogyny, either—not directly. Religious bias and racism and misogyny are all part of the bigger picture: They’re all part of the style, Donald Trump’s style.\nIt was the style that persuaded people to come out and vote for him.\nAnd that’s what we have to work against next time.",

      "title": "Ford F-150",
      "text": "Marty Padgett Editorial Director \nThe Ford F-150 is the best-selling vehicle in America, and has been for more than three decades. By extension, it's also the best-selling pickup truck family, when other F-Series variants are included. It's become a part of the American landscape, a staple for drivers that need workhorse vehicles and family-duty daily drivers alike. \nThe fabled F-150 competes most directly with the General Motors pickup truck twins, the Chevrolet Silverado 1500 and GMC Sierra 1500. Added together, those two trucks have outsold the F-150 in some years, but the Ford nameplate hangs securely onto its \"best-selling vehicle line\" title. Then there's the (formerly Dodge) Ram 1500, the third in the home-grown list. While the two largest Japanese makers have now dedicated a decade or more and opened plants in the U.S. to build their competing trucks, the Toyota Tundra and Nissan Titan remain far behind the trio of U.S. trucks. That said, a new Titan is looking to challenge the Ford and others. \nThe Ford F-150 range is staggering in its breadth and depth. It runs from \"rubber-mat special\" base-line trucks ordered for fleet duty all the way up to King Ranch and Raptor editions that ladle on luxury features unimaginable to pickup buyers a decade or two ago. The truck can be ordered in variations that suit utility workers, contractors, ranchers, fifth-wheel trailer owners, and off-roaders alike. \nThe F-150 was revamped for 2015, with a new steel frame clad in aluminum body panels, in the most revolutionary change any full-size truck ever has undergone. \nThe new Ford F-150 \nWith the introduction of the 2015 Ford F-150, the automaker set its sights on the most radical reinvention of the pickup truck yet. With a body composed mostly of aluminum and a downsized range of mostly turbocharged engines on tap, the latest Ford F-150 is a lot lighter on the road and more efficient at the gas pump. \nAt the top of that list of changes is an aluminum body. Ford says the high-strength aluminum alloy in the F-150’s body is at least as tough as steel but much lighter. The extensive use of aluminum saves about 700 pounds versus the previous all-steel F-150—a substantial reduction in mass that markedly improves gas mileage, ride, and handling. Under the aluminum body work, however, there’s still plenty of steel—in fact, more high-strength steel than ever is used in the structural underbody and frame elements to improve both capability and crash protection, while also saving about 70 pounds of weight versus the old setup. \nMORE: Read our 2017 Ford F-150 review \nInside, the look isn’t such a great departure from previous versions of the pickup, though there’s a new level of upscale design and nicer materials on premium trims. Blocky shapes and sturdy structures are the visual theme to back the F-150’s chosen mission. Ford has also added a long list of standard and optional features, including massaging seats, a surround-view camera system, and several nifty in-bed storage solutions. \nEngines are another area of innovation for the latest F-150. Four engines are available, and while three are familiar, the new 2.7-liter EcoBoost V-6 is an unusual choice; Ford sees it as the go-to for gas mileage in the new F-150. Also available is an updated 3.5-liter V-6 engine, which replaces the outgoing truck's 3.7-liter, as well as the familiar 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 and 5.0-liter V-8. All four engines are paired to a 4-speed automatic transmission. Both rear- and four-wheel-drive configurations are available. And for the first time, the base engine is available in a crew-cab truck, now that the weight has been brought down to meet its abilities. \nThe 2.7-liter V-6 is the most efficient in EPA ratings, followed by the naturally aspirated 3.5-liter and then the 3.5-liter EcoBoost, followed by the 5.0-liter V-8. The most efficient configuration manages 19 mpg city, 26 highway, 22 combined. In its least efficient guise, with the V-8 and four-wheel drive, the F-150 still manages ratings of 15/22/18 mpg. \nThe F-150’s front suspension is a coil-on-shock independent arrangement, while the rear retains the Hotchkiss-type solid axle riding on leaf springs and outboard shock absorbers. The rear suspension got a significant rework, however, with a switch to staggered shock placement among other changes. Improved electric-assist power steering and four-wheel-vented ABS disc brakes round out the key mechanical specs. \nAs before, three cab styles are offered: Regular, SuperCab, and SuperCrew. Matching the cabs, three beds will be offered, with lengths of 67.1, 78.9, and 97.6 inches. At launch, these cab and bed configurations will be complemented by five trims: XL, XLT, King Ranch, Lariat, and Platinum. New equipment offerings for the F-150 include blind-spot monitors with rear cross-traffic alerts, inflatable rear seat belts, pickup-box LED lighting, Sony premium audio, and on Platinum models, real wood trim. An off-road-oriented FX4 package is available, bundling off-road-tuned shocks, skid plates, and an electronic locking rear axle. \nFord used the 2015 Detroit auto show to announce a new Raptor based on the aluminum F-150. The new super-truck, which will arrive in the 2017 model year, features an upgraded suspension, a new four-wheel-drive system, and a high-output Ford Performance 3.5-liter EcoBoost V-6 that will make more power and torque than the outgoing 6.2-liter V-8 engine. Ford says the second-generation truck weighs 500 pounds less than the previous Raptor, as well. \nFord has also announced that the latest F-150 will be available with natural-gas and propane fuel options. Beginning with the 2016 model year, the F-150 equipped with the 5.0-liter V-8 is available with a gaseous-fuel prep package. Vehicle upfitters will then be able to install the necessary tanks and other hardware to convert the truck after sale. \nFor 2017, Ford outfitted its top-end F-150 models with a next-generation version of its 3.5-liter EcoBoost engine, which added 10 hp and 50 lb-ft of torque. It paired the new engine with a new transmission too: a 10-speed automatic jointly developed with General Motors. \nFord F-150 history \nAlthough Ford had previously built passenger-car-based trucks, the company sold its first true full-size pickups in 1948. Throughout much of the next decades its F-Series pickup trucks came with 6- or 8-cylinder engines; 3-, 4- and 5-speed manual transmissions; and a single two-door body style. By 1960, the \"F-100\" had been christened at the entry level, with F-250 and F-350 versions available with an early kind of four-wheel drive. As most trucks of the era were designed as \"flareside\" models, Ford added a plain-sided Styleside version that would dominate sales from then on. \nFor the fourth-generation F-100, Ford added a \"Ranger\" trim level and briefly built some trucks with unibody construction, returning to body-on-frame designs in the mid-1960s. Four-door models were offered, as were versions that adopted camper tops easily. A fifth generation arrived in 1967, with plainer sheet metal but the essential truck features intact: V-8 or inline-6, two- and four-door body styles, and payload capacity into heavy-duty territory. The sixth-generation truck is known primarily for adding the 302 V-8 to the lineup, spawning a new two-door Bronco SUV, and bringing the F-150 badge to the lineup; the latter was a higher-payload version of the existing F-100. \nThe F-150 grew more upright and more capable in the next three generations of trucks sold from 1980 to 1996. Diesel engines and new automatic transmissions joined the lineup, and the Ranger name was split into its own compact-pickup truck lineup. An \"Explorer\" trim level joined the F-150 lineup and would be spun off into its own SUV range in the same decade. In the eighth-generation truck that arrived in 1987, fuel injection became the norm, and flareside bodies went away for a time; rear anti-lock brakes were standard, for the first time on a full-size pickup truck. The ninth-generation truck went on sale in 1992 and brought with it a driver-side airbag and slightly smoother styling. \nThe 10th-generation F-150, sold from 1997 to 2004, marked a sea change in pickup trucks. Ever more the choice of commuters and daily drivers, the F-150 grew far more shapely and rounded in this generation—mimicking the lines of some of Ford's passenger cars. The old, squared-off truck was continued for a while, until Ford could tell if pickup-truck drivers would approve of the new looks. They did: The F-Series retained its best-selling title and grew even more popular. New engines came with the new body style, including versions of the Ford \"modular\" 4.6-liter and 5.4-liter V-8 that would prove very durable. The usual two- and four-door and extended-cab versions were available, as were four-wheel drive and a 4-speed automatic, along with heavy-duty F-250 versions. Special editions introduced in this generation included the SVT Lightning, the Harley-Davidson F-150, and the King Ranch edition. Safety ratings were poor, though, and while this F-150 had good reliability, its cruise-control system was involved in a major recall for the potential of causing a fire. This F-150 spawned a short-lived Lincoln Blackwood version, along with the longer-living Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator SUVs. \nThe 11th-generation F-150 arrived in 2004 and began to revert the truck's shape to its more angular past. A more upright grille, and more squared-off window openings were the hallmarks of the design. While it didn't change much mechanically, it did introduce standard curtain airbags and stability control to the full-size pickup range at Ford. The company put special attention into reducing the truck's cost and complexity, making it easier to build—and even more reliable. By some measures, it was considered the most reliable pickup truck ever built. Ford attempted another Lincoln pickup from this generation—the Lincoln Mark LT, which like the Blackwood before it, was a sales flop. \nThe last of a long line \nThe 12th generation of the Ford F-150 arrived in 2009, with its sheet metal even more crisply folded than earlier models—bearing many cues of a Ford F-350 Tonka concept truck from the late 2000s. The 12th-generation F-150 wore a very large, very bright, very tall grille to emphasize its \"truck\"-ness. It's somewhat redundant, since the F-150 was one of the most capable towing and hauling light-duty trucks available in America. \nIn 2011, the F-150 received its most comprehensive powertrain update. To go with its cutting-edge technology—including Bluetooth, SYNC voice control, even ventilated front seats—the F-150 gained four new engines, all teamed with a 6-speed automatic transmission. A 302-horsepower V-6 rejoined the lineup for the first time in more than a decade, and delivers the F-150's best gas mileage, at 17/23 mpg; turbocharging a version of the engine created the EcoBoost, with 365 horsepower and a towing capacity of 11,300 pounds. A 5.0-liter V-8 with 360 hp brought Mustang-style engine noises to the full-size truck, along with 15/21-mpg fuel economy. Finally, there was a 6.2-liter V-8, with 411 hp and 13/18 mpg fuel economy, offered in the most upscale F-150s as well as the off-road Raptor. \nFor the 2012 model year, Ford added a new automatic all-wheel-drive mode to some 4x4 F-150s, and swapped out limited-slip differentials for an electronically simulated limited-slip function. Then on the 2013 Ford F-150 , the automaker added MyFord Touch's suite of voice, steering-wheel, and LCD touchscreen controls to the pickup, with other minor changes to the front end, including high-intensity discharge headlamps to some models. The King Ranch model returned as well, with a new black interior choice and standard MyFord Touch, for a base price of more than $44,000. \nIn this generation, the F-150 came in a host of cab, bed, powertrain, and suspension variations. Three cab configurations with multiple wheelbases and box lengths each were offered, providing choices to satisfy just about any trucker's need with the F-150. Properly outfitted, this F-150 could tow 11,300 pounds—while earning top crash-test scores (including IIHS Top Safety Pick status and a \"Good\" rating in the roof-strength test). Unlike GM's pickups, there was no Hybrid edition, and the F-150 fell behind the Ram's excellent ride quality. However, this F-150 had a well-built cabin, excellent shift quality and comfortable seats—as well as the off-road-ready Raptor model and some of the most up-to-date luxury features found on any truck. \nOver the years, the F-150 has been mechanically related to the Ford Expedition and Lincoln Navigator, though those SUVs now only share powertrains with the trucks.",

      "text": "Ford Ka Trail Is A Nice Looking Figo Cross Ford Ka Trail Is A Nice Looking Figo Cross The Ka Trail gets raised ground clearance, black cladding and new decals There are no mechanical updates to the Ford Ka Trail Ford could consider introducing the Ka Trail in India as the Figo Cross \nMuch like India, the Brazilian market too fancies the idea of compact crossovers. No wonder then, Ford has unveiled the Ka Trail crossover at the 2016 Sao Paulo International Auto Show, one of the more interesting models at the American automaker's pavilion. Sold as the Figo in India, the Ford Ka is a popular hatchback in Brazil and the new Trail version makes it off-road compatible with a bunch of upgrades. 4.94 Lakh * On Road Price (New Delhi) FIND OUT MORE Ford Ka Trail could be sold as the Figo Cross in India \nOver the standard model, the 2017 Ford Ka Trail gets black plastic cladding around the wheel arches, faux brushed silver skid plate, raised ground clearance and 15-inch gunmetal finished alloy wheels (standard version gets 14-inch) wrapped dual purpose tyres. \nYou also get a new honeycomb mesh grille at the front, while the headlamps get the smoked effect with the fog lamps blacked out too. The side profile gets 'Trail' decal across the doors, while the ORVMs, door handles and roof rails are finished in matte grey that helps create a contrast in the styling. The interior gets no significant change as such, save for the new leather upholstered seats with contrast stitching and sport pedals. The blacked out treatment to the fog lamps, grille and wheels lends a sporty touch \nThe new Ford Ka Trail has been tastefully spruced up and does not defer too much from the standard hatchback. Power options remain the same on the Brazilian model with the 1.5-litre Sigma four-cylinder petrol engine tuned to produce 110hp and 146Nm of torque. The motor comes paired to a 5-speed manual gearbox as standard. The Ford Ka Trail will go on sale in Brazil next year \nThe hatchback-crossover segment has a quite a number of offerings in India including the Toyota Etios Cross , Hyundai i20 Active , Volkswagen Cross Polo , Fiat Urban Cross and much more. It isn't clear if Ford India plans to introduce the Ka Trail, or Figo Trail as it will be called in the country. With the liking for butch looking small cars strong in India, the Ford Figo Trail just might find acceptance. Images Source: Carplace",

Photo by Chris Lee, Ford not sure what to expect from Billikens Buy Now Chris Lee \nSt. Louis University head coach Travis Ford during an exhibition game between St. Louis University and Greenville on Friday, Nov. 4, 2016, at Chaifetz Arena in St. Louis. Photo by Chris Lee, clee@post-dispatch.com \nTravis Ford has a plan for the day of his regular-season debut at St. Louis University, and he knows exactly how it will unfold. \nEverything will largely be within his control until 7 p.m. on Friday when the Billikens tip off against Ball State at Chaifetz Arena. What happens beyond that is anybody’s guess. \nBut even sticking to his longtime game day routine will be a little unusual for a coach who is accustomed to starting new jobs, which he will be doing for the fifth time in 20 years. \n“I’ve got a routine but it will be different because I have a different drive, a different locker room, a different walk to the court,” Ford said. “What I do is the same but the surroundings are different. From that aspect there’s anxiousness. \n“It’s not a nervousness as much as not knowing what to expect. We had an exhibition game but you just don’t have a great feel for the environment and not a great feel for the routine. It’s just not knowing what to expect.” \nWhen Ford started jobs at Campbellsville University, Eastern Kentucky, Massachusetts and Oklahoma State, he opened with wins against the likes of Clinch Valley, Urbana College, Hartford and Florida Atlantic. He might have his toughest challenge yet in Ball State, which is not a national power but coming off a good season with a lot of returning experience. \nWhile Ford has immersed himself in his players and teaching a new system over seven months, he still doesn’t have a handle on how his team will react to a game situation. \nSeven players return from a group that went 11-21 and they are joined by three freshmen, who are all likely to see significant minutes. \n“With our team you don’t know what to expect,” he said. “We didn’t practice well (Thursday) so that doesn’t ever set well with me. I’m anxious to see how they respond. I’ve had a lot of teams that I knew the day before a game how they’d play. Sometimes they might practice bad but I knew they’d play well. Sometimes the opposite. It’s always about the feel of the team, and I don’t know about this team yet.” \nTo make the day feel as typical as possible, Ford will stick to the schedule that he has kept for years. \nInstead of leaving for the arena at 6 a.m. as on most days, he’ll go for coffee and review his scouting report at home. He’ll get to Chaifetz in time for an 11:30 a.m. meeting with his staff. \nHe plans to go for a run on campus when the meeting ends and return for the team shootaround at 2. While his assistant coaches put the transfers through a workout after the shootaround, Ford will retire to a room in the arena for two hours of alone time to watch TV or game film until 5. \n“I used to have a lot of coaches who left the shootaround and went home,” he said. “But I’ve got my staff staying here because I don’t want anyone to get stuck in traffic or anything, so no one is leaving.” \nFord will then find out if Chaifetz will be packed as he envisioned at his introductory press conference. \nLast season’s average attendance of 6,757 was the second lowest in the eight-year history of Chaifetz. The Billikens also had their worst home record at 7-11. Against Ball State, they will provide a first impression for the Ford era. \n“How we play had better be pretty consistent, home or away,” Ford said. “We need the fans, no question. You hope to have a homecourt advantage. ... We don’t want fans to wait until we’re winning big time to come. When they leave Chaifetz this season, hopefully they leave saying, ‘That’s a team I can get behind. I like their style.’ And hopefully we just won.” \nStu Durando",

Simply wave your foot below the rear bumper or, on models with a proximity key, approach the liftgate with the key on you to have it automatically pop open. \nRelated: Which 2016 Cars Have Hands-Free Liftgates? \nHands-free liftgates and trunks are rapidly becoming available on more non-luxury models, and this list of 2017 vehicles that offer them is considerably longer than the one for the 2016 model year. That doesn't mean they come cheaply, however. \nIn some cases, hands-free access to the cargo area is offered only on the higher- or highest-priced versions of a particular model. In others, this feature might be part of an extra-cost option package that includes several expensive features, some of which you might not want. \nMany more vehicles offer power liftgates or trunks activated by pushing a button on a key fob or inside the vehicle, but this list covers only those with hands-free operation. 2017 Vehicles Available with Hands-Free Liftgate or Trunk \nAudi",

      "text": "  11:41 am Ford has confirmed that it is finally ready to bring the EcoSport to the North American market.The subcompact crossover has been available in international markets for more than a decade, eventually expanding to Argentina, Brazil, China, India, Mexico, South Africa, Taiwan, Japan and Europe, among other regions.Rapper DJ Khaled apparently slipped the news early on Snapchat. Ford later confirmed a Monday unveiling event in a statement to Automotive News .Whenever it does arrive, the EcoSport will enter a fast-growing segment currently occupied by the Chevrolet Trax , Jeep Renegade , Honda HR-V , Kia Soul and others.Spy shots have already pointed to a US-launch, presumably with a significant update to the global model. Ford could also be fast-tracking the next-generation EcoSport with North American in mind, but the company has not yet disclosed a possible launch window.Additional details will be revealed at Monday's unveiling ahead of the Los Angeles Auto Show. \n ",

      "text": "  Is Ford Under Undue Duress From Investors? Ford is in a better position than ever to handle a slowdown, but the stock does not reflect that November 11, 2016 | About: F +0% GM +0% \nAs the automobile market in the United States struggles to stay above $17 million in monthly sales, it has been painful to watch Ford ( NYSE:F ) and General Motors ' ( NYSE:GM ) stock price go through a slow and deliberate decline. Ever since the discussion on the peak of U.S. auto sales started, the pressure on auto stocks has been immense and recovery seems to be totally out of sight for now. \nFortunately, what goes up does not always have to come down as auto sales in the United States did not plunge as predicted. As you can see from the graph above, sales peaked at 18.12 million in November last year and dropped sharply in the next month, which triggered the downward grind for auto stocks. But sales have been resilient since then, holding above the 16.6 million mark in the last twelve months and recovering nicely in October to around 18 million.   F \nDespite the improvement, the market remains unimpressed as both Ford and GM’s stock have only moved lower. Though both stocks are still priced above the lows set in early February, the charts are extremely depressing to look at. One of the key reasons for the low expectations from auto companies is that around this time last year, auto sales were at or above 18 million monthly units. On a year-over-year basis, auto sales are down, which is further fuelling the discussion of peak auto sales having been achieved. \nIt is understandable that at 18 million monthly units, sales are indeed near the highest levels in history. The number of months spent above that level have been few and far between and appear to be the peak market potential. But to expect it to fall to the ground just because it is near its peak is extremely wrong. As long as credit is available and we stay out of recession, car sales should move sideways. \nOne side effect of that is margins will become a bit tighter for the companies as they compete and increase their market spending. Nevertheless, it is my opinion that the stock price decline is not completely in sync with what is happening within the industry. \nFord’s profit dropped by 55% during the third quarter, while revenue fell by 9%. Ford posted record third-quarter results last year and the sales slowdown in the U.S. did have a huge impact on that. But the company is in a much better position than where they were 10 years ago. Their U.S. business is solid enough to handle a slowdown, the Europe segment turnaround is complete and they started posting profits in the region. Ford’s China business is slowly getting into shape as well. \nNone of this is going to make any difference because the entire auto segment remains under pressure. The segment looks extremely cheap at the current price point, though returns might take longer to come by. \nDisclosure: I have no positions in the stock mentioned above and no intention to initiate a position in the next 72 hours.

      "text": "Ford: Will Green-Beckham ever catch on? Updated: November 11, 2016 — 5:45 PM EST Share Bob Ford INQUIRER COLUMNIST \nBob Ford is an award-winning sports columnist for the Inquirer. He is a four-time Pennsylvania Sportswriter of the Year, as selected by the National Sportscasters and Sportswriters Association. His work has been cited numerous times by Associated Press Sports Editors judges, and he won an Eclipse Award for outstanding coverage of horse racing. Prior to becoming a columnist at the Inquirer, Ford was the 76ers beat writer for six seasons and then a general assignment feature writer with a specialty in Olympic sports. In 1995, he was designated a fellow of the Knight Center for Specialized Journalism. Ford has written sports in the Philadelphia area since 1981, when he served as the Phillies beat writer and later as a general sports columnist for the Delaware County Daily Times. More by Bob Ford Nov 7 \nDorial Green-Beckham is 6-foot-5, 240 pounds, fast and agile, and 23 years old. If you wanted to build an elite NFL wide receiver – a slightly taller, comparably quick version of Julio Jones, the elite pass catcher the Eagles face on Sunday – the prototype would look a lot like Green-Beckham. \nThis isn't news, and hasn't been for a while. When Green-Beckham was coming out of high school, Rivals.com named him the No. 1 recruit in the nation. Not just the No. 1 wide receiver recruit, which Jones also was as a high school senior, but the No. 1 recruit at any position. \nSo, what happened between then and now? How is it that Green-Beckham, as he should be entering the most exciting, productive period of his professional career, is the most scorned receiver for a team on which that's not an easy title to hold. \nGreen-Beckham was the intended receiver on five passes last Sunday against the Giants, but didn't catch any of them. For the season, he has 18 receptions on 36 targeted attempts and has seemed to sort of drift around the field at times, usually in the close company of a defender. When the ball does come his way, this often appears to be a surprise to him and he reacts like a man trying to catch a balloon while wearing oven mitts. Overall, it hasn't been pretty. \n\"It didn't go as well as we planned in the game. Going against coverages like that, we just know every week we have to continue to work on those little things, those little details,\" Green-Beckham said after practice last week. \"The first thing you have to do is get the timing down, starting at practice, and every day after practice we work with the quarterbacks so during the games, situations like that don't happen.\" \nDoug Pederson went out of his way to express his support for Green-Beckham after the Giants game. It isn't as if Pederson has so many talented receivers he can afford to cast one aside. Green-Beckham was on the field for 65 percent of the offensive snaps against New York and there's no reason to believe his workload will decrease this week. What exactly he was doing on the 44 plays in which he wasn't involved is a good question, but Pederson is sticking with him. \n\"He's a young player. Again, remember we got him late here, so he's been kind of behind the teaching curve,\" Pederson said. \"He hasn't had a full offseason yet, under our system.\" \nUnless Green-Beckham improves in the second half of this season, he's even-money to never have a full offseason here. So, this is something of a career dividing line for the best recruit in the country who has somehow become the worst receiver on a bad receiving team. There are factors working against him, as there have been throughout his life, but maybe this time it clicks. \nDorial Isaiah Green grew up in a Springfield, Mo., family that was not just broken but shattered. He lived in a succession of foster homes until the age of 16, when he and a brother were adopted by his high school coach, John Beckham. It was a difficult early life and it would take more expertise than can be employed here to say if the receiver's later problems, off the field and on it, were a result. \nIn any case, there have been problems, some of which are the reason Green-Beckham is with his fourth team in four years. He was dismissed from the Missouri team after two seasons following a series of run-ins with police, none of which resulted in criminal charges. He was twice arrested for marijuana possession and, more seriously, was accused of breaking through the door of an apartment in search of his girlfriend and knocking another woman down a short flight of steps during a brief melee. The alleged victim declined to cooperate with police. \nGreen-Beckham transferred to Oklahoma, but only practiced with the Sooners during the 2014 season because the NCAA denied his request for a waiver of the transfer eligibility rule. He entered the 2015 NFL draft and was taken in the second round, 40th overall, by the Tennessee Titans. One underwhelming season and most of one frustrating training camp later, the Titans traded him to the Eagles in exchange for Dennis Kelly, who had been a backup tackle here and who is a backup tackle there. \n\"I think a lot of times it has to do with culture,\" said receiver Jordan Matthews. \"I wasn't in Tennessee, but there are some receivers who aren't there anymore. And there were some older players on the back half of their career who don't have to put as much on the field to perform in games. We have to practice [here] on a whole 'nother level. That's what's going to take DGB to the next level. His routes are getting crisper, he's more focused, he's learning the plays. He's doing all those things.\" \nCan it be that simple, that Green-Beckham has never been in an environment in which work and precision are demanded? That seems unlikely, but at 23, perhaps he is finally about to get it. \n\"You have to be in the right place at the right time. If the route is 12 yards, go 12 yards. That's what the quarterback needs,\" Green-Beckham said. \"You have to be patient. Opportunities are going to come.\" \nTrue enough, but Dorial Green-Beckham isn't going to turn things around and become the receiver everyone expected until he fully focuses on the fact that opportunities can go, too. \n@bobfordsports November 11, 2016 — 5:45 PM EST The Philadelphia Inquirer We encourage respectful comments but reserve the right to delete anything that doesn't contribute to an engaging dialogue Help us moderate this thread by flagging comments that violate our guidelines Commenting policy | Comments FAQ Comment policy: \nPhilly.com comments are intended to be civil, friendly conversations.

      "text": "In October of 1955, a marketing researcher at Ford named Robert Young wrote the poet Marianne Moore a curious letter. Ford had designed a new car, which it hoped would revolutionize the industry, and it was struggling to find a good name. Young said that the options his division had come up with were “characterized by an embarrassing pedestrianism.” Perhaps a poet could devise something to convey, “through association or other conjuration, some visceral feeling of elegance, fleetness, advanced features and design.” In the following months, Moore sent Ford a long list of suggestions that were anything but pedestrian: Intelligent Bullet, Ford Fabergé, Mongoose Civique, Bullet Cloisoné, Utopian Turtletop. Ford, unsurprisingly, didn’t go for any of them. Instead, after considering more than six thousand names, it settled on one that has since become a byword for failure: Edsel.\nSee the rest of the story at newyorker.com \nRelated:\nIvanka Trump Fights to Save the Brand \nAdvertising Slogans Any Craft Brewery Is Free to Use \nTrump’s Locker Room Is His Safe Space ",

      "text": "Thomson Reuters \nThis week Ford Motor Company unveiled a handful of technological ideas, like driver-assist features that use radar and sensors to give your car an extra pair of eyes on the road.\nOne feature alerts you before you drive in the wrong direction. Another helps you steer away from an obstacle in situations where it’s too late to apply the brakes.\nIn the time that it takes for the driver to fully recognize that he or she is about to crash, the car is programmed to swerve into safety. Perhaps more exciting is that these features could come as early as the next two years.\nThen there’s the sneak peek of finalists from the company’s internal Last Mile Mobility Challenge, which asks employees to dream up ways to get drivers from the car to their final destination.\nThe ideas revealed so far include a self-loading wheelchair for drivers with physical disabilities, a folding electric tricycle that doubles as a shopping cart, and intriguingly, a Segway-hoverboard hybrid that looks somewhat like an oversized Roomba , as TechCrunch keenly observes .\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/mLasbNBmOqQ\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \nThese innovations come at a time when self-driving cars have yet to hit the road en masse, though the driver-assist technology seems subtly to be preparing us to get comfortable with the idea of yielding (almost) full control of the wheel to our vehicles. One feature the company is touting, for example, will park the car for you at the press of a button — “like magic,” says a test driver in Ford’s promotional video . She sits back in her seat and watches as the car reverses itself into a spot along the curb, the steering wheel spinning all on its own.\nDespite the growing number of cities dreaming of a car-free future, or at least a multimodal one, Ford’s latest ideas bet on Americans holding onto their love of cars and their tendency to commute alone. Unless the trunk of a Ford Focus can fit five of those Carr-E’s, as the circular transport devices are called, it’s an idea meant for the driver, and the driver alone. After all, as Richard Florida reported last year, the Census Bureau finds that 86 percent of U.S. workers still commute by car and more than 75 percent do so alone.\nAt the same time, though, Americans don’t experience the same enthusiasm and excitement as they once did for buying cars, a trend the Washington Post  recently described as “America’s once magical—now mundane—love affair with cars.” That’s true at least among the younger crowd, according to a handful of studies out there.\nYoutube Embed:\nhttp://www.youtube.com/embed/6U98X1LdIQs\nWidth: 560px\nHeight: 315px \n For city dwellers in general, the Post writes, owning a car is a hassle, especially when it comes to parking and traffic. And perhaps, that’s one of the problems that car companies are trying to tackle, in particular with Ford’s parking assistant feature and its Last Mile Mobility challenge. (Ford has not responded to a request for comment.)\nFord is no stranger to how the world is rethinking commuting. For one thing, the company recently invested in mass- and microtransit, partnering with the ridehailing company Bridj to bring on-demand public transit to Kansas City, Missouri.\nBut Ford is, after all, a car company and it’s in their interest to keep the thrill of automobiles—autonomous or otherwise—alive. If you remember, the company was recently awarded a patent for rear wheel that doubles a “self-propelled unicycle,” for when drivers want to ditch their cars in dense cities for the last mile and, as my colleague Adam Sneed writes , try feeling like Batman.\nNOW WATCH: We finally learned the purpose of that extra shoelace hole on your sneakers \n",
