      "text": "Credit: Netflix Charlie Brooker Charlie Brooker also joked that after trying to impose it on the rest of the world, the U.S. had discovered that \"democracy may in fact be shit.\" \nIt's probably fair to say that Black Mirror creator Charlie Brooker isn't entirely overjoyed by Donald Trump's election victory. \nHosting this week's edition of the BBC's long-running comedy current affairs quiz Have I Got News For You on Friday, the Brit opened proceedings with the show's usual intro, \"In the news this week\" before letting out a blood-curdling scream. \nInevitably, Trump becoming president was the central topic on discussion, but Brooker joked that Tuesday night's results showed that U.S. voters \"may actually be very progressive.\" \n\"Sure, it may be bad news for minorities and women and the other many, many people he has insulted,\" he said. \"But on the plus side, progressively, they've elected their first openly-crazy man to the most powerful office in the world.\" \nShow regular Ian Hislop, who also edits satirical weekly magazine Private Eye, added that the U.S. had \"broken the rubber-padded ceiling.\" \nBrooker concluded the election news by saying that the U.S. had discovered that\"after all these of trying to impose it on the rest of the world, democracy may in fact be shit.\"",

      "text": "  \nIt looks like Netflix won’t be officially offering offline playback anytime soon — at least in the U.S. — but that doesn’t mean someone else isn’t working on it. This week, MediaMall launched PlayOn Cloud, a service that records video from Netflix, HBO Now, and others, allowing them to be viewed offline on a mobile device. \nThe company refers to PlayOn Cloud as “a DVR for streaming video,” and that is the easiest way to think about it. The app keeps a copy of the recording in the cloud for 30 days, allowing it to be downloaded to the device of your choice. The app even includes AdSkip technology, similar to what DVR progenitor TiVo offers. \nMore: DirecTV Now live TV-streaming service will feature premium channels from Starz \n“The PlayOn Cloud iOS app takes our revolutionary Streaming Video Recorder to the next level and untethers it from the PC,” PlayOn’s president and CEO, Jeff Lawrence, said in a statement. “We are now offering streamers something they’ve always wanted — a way to watch their favorite streaming programming on their mobile device when no internet is available. This is a game changer for commuters, travelers, users with mobile data caps, and those who don’t want to miss movies and TV shows when they expire from streaming services.” \nWhether or not PlayOn Cloud is for you likely depends on how often you watch video where a reliable connection isn’t available. In our time with a beta version of the app, the user interface felt slightly clunky, and often wasn’t as intuitive as the actual streaming services’ interfaces. Then there’s the issue of cost. \nMore: Hands on: Plex Cloud \nIn order to record, you’ll need to purchase recording credits, with each credit costing $1. Each credit allows you to record one movie or episode of a TV show, but if you’re planning on recording a lot, this could quickly add up. \nThe PlayOn Cloud app is currently only available for iOS devices, and is a free download in the App Store . PlayOn is currently running a promotion, with anyone who downloads the app and creates an account before November 13 getting five free recording credits. Also watch: Sony Xperia Z5 – Hands on",

      "title": "Netflix Movies: Review Of ‘True Memoirs Of An International Assassin’—Another Miss For Netflix",
      "text": "\nTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin is the latest title on the list of original Netflix movies. Recently, Netflix has released original movies like ARQ, Mascots, The Fundamentals of Caring , with many more to come. The company has stated that they want to focus on adding even more original content. It seems that the majority of their original series are very popular, but their movies seem to be more hit and miss. And unfortunately, True Memoirs Of An International Assassin is another miss for Netflix and their original movies.\nThe Netflix Original Movies Formula Unlike Netflix hit series like House of Cards or Orange is the New Black , their movies often are formulaic and offer nothing an audience hasn’t seen before. However, that’s not always a bad thing. Movies can be formulaic but if they deliver what people expect from the particular genre, then it can still be a success. In The Fundamentals of Caring , the formula was the usual for sentimental feel-good movies; but it offered a plot that had not been told before. In addition, the actors delivered exactly what audiences were looking for.\nARQ was another addition to the “time lapse” subgenre of action, and although they didn’t show audiences anything new, they told a solid story that offered plenty of action. True Memoirs …told a story that has been told before, almost every scene was predictable, and for an action-comedy the film delivered little of either.\n[Image by Netflix] The Plot Kevin James ( Paul Blart: Mall Cop ) portrays Sam Larson, an author who writes a fictional novel about, as the title indicates, the memoirs of an international assassin. His book is published as a true story and he ends up being mistaken for a contract killer. He winds up being kidnapped and taken out of the country and thrown into an assassination plot.\nThe Delivery The movie unfolds as one would expect, offering the usual tropes of similar movies like Tropic Thunder and Netflix’s The Do-Over . There are definitely some funny scenes as anything with Kevin James will offer that. But for those searching for movies that present constant laugh-out-loud moments, keep searching. The movie is more humorous than outright funny, which would be fine if it focused on more action, but spoiler—it doesn’t.\n[Image by Netflix] There are action-packed scenes, but not enough of them. And if you’ve seen the trailer, then you’ve seen glimpses of almost every action sequence that the film has to offer. The film also feels like it drags on too long, which it shouldn’t since it is only 98 minutes. It feels as if it didn’t know what it wanted to be. RogerEbert.com explains why this is one of the more disappointing additions to original Netflix movies .\n“The bigger problem is a distinct lack of actual laughs from those jokes, even the first time we hear them. I chuckled once or twice at Riggle & Howze, but it’s tempting to not even categorize the film as a comedy. It’s a melting pot of a diversion, too thin in any specific genre department to really register. It’s not action-packed enough, not funny enough, and the characters aren’t memorable enough.”\nOTHER NETFLIX ARTICLES FROM THE INQUISITR \nWho Wins?

The new Kevin James flick isn’t the worst addition to Netflix movies, but it’s by no means exceptional. If you’re looking for a movie to fold laundry to, have on the background while cleaning, or you are home sick, then you might enjoy it just fine. But if you are looking for Netflix movies that will deliver high-quality action or comedy, you are better off skipping True Memoirs of an International Assassin .\n[Featured Image by Netflix]\nNetflix Movies: Review Of ‘True Memoirs Of An International Assassin’—Another Miss For Netflix is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "InStyle November 11, 2016 Ever wondered what it's like to live like a royal? Netflix's newest drama, The Crown , takes you inside Buckingham Palace during Queen Elizabeth II 's early reign. The series debuted last week and is said to be the streaming service's most expensive, over-the-top production to date. We've already binged the entire 10-episode season! The Crown begins with the Queen's ascension to the British throne at age 25, following the death of her father King George VI. Over the course of the series, we see an intimate portrait of her life as a monarch, from her interactions with Winston Churchill to her sister's forbidden love affair. We even catch a glimpse of her practicing her coronation walk with a very wobbly (albeit regal) crown.

      "text": "You can now watch Netflix shows offline for only a DOLLAR Rachel Paige More Lately, there’s been a lot of talk about Netflix making offline viewing available for their subscribers . This would be awesome, because it would give us the ability to watch things like Gilmore Girls and Kimmy Schmidt when wifi service isn’t around — like say, on a subway or in an airplane, or somewhere else where there’s not a copious amount of wifi. We’ve been talking about this for MONTHS, and it seems that Netflix is actually on the brink of making it happen . Until that happens for real, though, do you wanna watch some Netflix shows for only a dollar? PlayOn Cloud , a free video streaming recording app, allows you to download things you stream, for $1 each title. The video is then stored on your device for 30 days, and you can watch it as many times as you want before it disappears. Even better, it actually works with a dozen different streaming platforms, not just Netflix: Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo View, HBO Now, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW. As PlayOn Cloud explains: When you select a video in the PlayOn Cloud app on your iPad or iPhone, we start a stream on a virtual PC in the cloud and record that stream like a DVR records cable TV. Once that recording is complete, an .mp4 file will be ready for you to enjoy. You can download that the .mp4 video file from the PlayOn Cloud app on your iPad, iPhone, or iPod touch. We also email you a link to it so you can download it to any other device that does not have the app installed. This sure sounds pretty awesome….but just remember, it’s a dollar an episode. If you want an entire season of House of Cards on your phone for 30 days, that’s going to cost you $13, which is almost double what it costs for a month of Netflix. But, if you do have a lot of traveling come up, and you KNOW you need that Parks and Rec episode for your journey, dropping $5 for five episodes doesn’t sound too bad. If this sounds like something you need in your life right now, you can download the app here . Even better, your first five recordings are free!!",

      "title": "*Gilmore Girls*: Will Rory End Up With Jess, Dean, Logan, or None of the Above?",
      "text": "We&apos;re just a few weeks away from the premiere of Netflix&apos;s four-part Gilmore Girls reboot —aptly titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life —and fans are hellbent on figuring out who Rory (Alexis Bledel) ends up with. Seriously, #TeamJess, #TeamLogan, and #TeamDean parties have divided our nation infinitely more than Donald Trump. (OK, that might be an exaggeration, but my point is made.)\nOf course, it&apos;s reductive to solely focus on Rory&apos;s love life. (Frankly, I don&apos;t give a damn about her relationship status.) She&apos;s a smart, witty, and complex female character who extends far beyond which bro she&apos;s snogging. However, that doesn&apos;t mean we can&apos;t discuss her romantic pursuits—so long as we give her other nuances just as much shine. That being said, stay tuned for my next think piece, titled \"Rory Gilmore Should Say F—ck You to Men and Win a Nobel Peace Prize.\" (My editor hasn&apos;t approved that headline yet...)\nBut that&apos;s next week. Today, I actually am going to focus on Rory&apos;s old boyfriends—but in a way that stays true to my brand of \"IDGAF About Rory&apos;s Old Boyfriends.\" As most ~serious~ journalists do, I spend most of my free time trolling Gilmore Girls Reddit threads. These pages typically just house out-there theories about how Emily Gilmore is an alien or that Stars Hollow is full of dead people. However, my latest dive into the Gilmore Girls deep Web proved particularly interesting. I unearthed several pieces of #content that make me think something cRazY: Rory ends up with—wait for it— none of her old boyfriends. Do you hear that? That&apos;s the sound of every sorority house in America imploding.\nGranted, this is just a theory. For all I know, Rory becomes the Queen Bee in a polygamous relationship with all three of these boys—which would actually be amazing. However, my evidence strongly suggests that Rory&apos;s past flames remain squarely in, well, the past. And that&apos;s a win too, because A. Jess, Logan, and Dean all suck, and B. Fans will finally stop zeroing in on Rory&apos;s love life. Where are all the Nobel Peace Prize theories, huh?!\nLet&apos;s go through the receipts that led me to this conclusion, shall we?\nLiza Weil gives a very telling interview to Marie Claire .\nWeil, who plays Paris Geller on GG, implied that the show&apos;s creator (Amy Sherman-Palladino) approached Rory&apos;s old boyfriends as things of her past in the Netflix reboot. \"Amy comes to it from the point of view that none of those previous boyfriends were the right person for Rory,\" Weil said. \"They served a purpose for her during that time in her life, and she hasn&apos;t necessarily found &apos;the person&apos; yet.\" Obviously, this doesn&apos;t 100 percent confirm or deny anything. However, it indicates that Logan, Jess, and Dean only exist in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life to provide context for Rory&apos;s larger story. And I&apos;m here for that.\nPalladino tells Time magazine she wishes fans weren&apos;t so obsessed with Rory&apos;s old boyfriends.\n\"Sometimes, I wish that the Dean and Jess thing weren’t so prominent because in the grand scheme of Rory’s life, who her boyfriend was when she was 16 years old is such a small event,\" she said. If Palladino doesn&apos;t think Jess and Dean are huge parts of Rory&apos;s existence, it seems unlikely she would make either of them her ~person~. And her statement inadvertently implies to Logan, as well. After all, who you want to date at 22 vs. who you want to date at 30 are two drastically different people.\nJared Padalecki (Dean) only worked on Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life for one day.\nUnless his scene was a shotgun wedding with Rory, it seems unlikely that these two end up happily ever after. If Rory does have an adult boyfriend, Palladino would certainly need more than one day to tell his story. Right?\nJess and Rory&apos;s reunion in the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life trailer is sterile AF.\nThere&apos;s no heat. No sparks. No nothing. There isn&apos;t even any fun dialogue—they just repeat the same phrase to each other. If that doesn&apos;t scream, \"Oh hi, old friend who I haven&apos;t seen in years, let&apos;s awkwardly catch up,\" then I don&apos;t know what does.\nJess only appears in three episodes of the reboot. Dean appears in one.\nAgain, Rory&apos;s future husband would need way more screen time. Logan does appear in all four episodes; however, both Weil and Palladino&apos;s Quote: s support why he is not \"The One.\"\nAnnnd there you have it, folks: To me, this is solid proof that Rory, like many people, does not marry a person she met in high school. Radical, I know.",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nA funny thing happened to me while watching season 2 of the Netflix show Narcos , which is a fictional depiction of Columbian druglord Pablo Escobar's life. No, it wasn't that I wanted to sell drugs and become a rebel myself, but that the wife of Escobar on the show, actress Paulina Gaitan, is a major babe. \nThen I went to her Instagram account and realized that, yep, she's an absolute stunner. \nPaulina's most recent pic, which is of her in red lipstick and a low-cut top, is straight fire, and you don't need to be a genius criminal to realize that.

      "text": "Thanks to Netflix, characters like Daredevil, Luke Cage, and The Punisher are more popular now than ever before, and next February, Elektra is getting her own series. As you can see below, she's been given a makeover which brings her more in line with her small screen counterpart, though it was probably about time that she ditch the costume she's been assassinating targets in for decades now.\nMatt Owens will be writing Elektra , and while he's new to the world of comic books, he's had some Marvel Cinematic Universe experience after serving as a writer for Luke Cage 's TV series. He'll be joined by artist Alec Morgan, but Elektra won't be in her regular haunts of New York and Japan as the series will actually be set in Las Vegas. Who will she square off against? Avengers and X-Men baddie Arcade!\n\"When we find Elektra in this story she is trying to hide in plain sight,\" Morgan explains. \"She’s running. From everything. Vegas is a place that is extremely unfamiliar to her so that makes it perfect for her to hide out. But much like New York, Vegas has a dark side. And Elektra may not be able to stay out of trouble for long.\" Will you guys pick this title up when it goes on sale early next year?",

      "text": "As Donald Trump prepares to take office, the fate of net neutrality, or the policy that broadband providers do not favor traffic from one source or destination over another, is in question.\nThe outcome could affect video streaming and other services that consumers use, and and impact companies with streaming services such as Netflix ( NFLX ) , Dish Network ( DISH ) and network operators such as AT&T ( T ) , Verizon ( VZ ) , Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Charter ( CHTR ) .\nComcast is a holding in Jim Cramer's Action Alerts PLUS Charitable Trust Portfolio . Want to be alerted before Cramer buys or sells CMCSA ? Learn more now .\nNetflix faces the greatest risk among the media companies that UBS tracks, analyst Doug Mitchelson suggested in a report.\n\"Without Net Neutrality rules in place, broadband providers would be able to charge online video services for bandwidth usage, as well as sell priority access (guaranteed streaming quality) and favor their own services,\" Mitchelson wrote.\nNetwork operators could charge Netflix, which declined to comment, a fee to carry its movies and shows. Netflix could face a disadvantage against Hulu, Mitchelson added, because the rival streaming service has struck deals with Cablevision ( CVC ) and other cable providers to allow its service through a channel on set-top boxes.\nWhile net neutrality is absent from the \"positions\" page of the Trump campaign site, the president-elect has tweeted his displeasure with the regulations.",

      "title": "*Gilmore Girls*: Will Rory End Up With Jess, Dean, Logan, or None of the Above? | Glamour",
      "text": "Facebook PHOTO: Alamy Stock Photo \nWe're just a few weeks away from the premiere of Netflix's four-part Gilmore Girls reboot —aptly titled Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life —and fans are hellbent on figuring out who Rory (Alexis Bledel) ends up with. Seriously, #TeamJess, #TeamLogan, and #TeamDean parties have divided our nation infinitely more than Donald Trump. (OK, that might be an exaggeration, but my point is made.) \nOf course, it's reductive to solely focus on Rory's love life. (Frankly, I don't give a damn about her relationship status.) She's a smart, witty, and complex female character who extends far beyond which bro she's snogging. However, that doesn't mean we can't discuss her romantic pursuits—so long as we give her other nuances just as much shine. That being said, stay tuned for my next think piece, titled \"Rory Gilmore Should Say F—ck You to Men and Win a Nobel Peace Prize.\" (My editor hasn't approved that headline yet...) \nBut that's next week. Today, I actually am going to focus on Rory's old boyfriends—but in a way that stays true to my brand of \"IDGAF About Rory's Old Boyfriends.\" As most ~serious~ journalists do, I spend most of my free time trolling Gilmore Girls Reddit threads. These pages typically just house out-there theories about how Emily Gilmore is an alien or that Stars Hollow is full of dead people. However, my latest dive into the Gilmore Girls deep Web proved particularly interesting. I unearthed several pieces of #content that make me think something cRazY: Rory ends up with—wait for it— none of her old boyfriends. Do you hear that? That's the sound of every sorority house in America imploding. \nGranted, this is just a theory. For all I know, Rory becomes the Queen Bee in a polygamous relationship with all three of these boys—which would actually be amazing. However, my evidence strongly suggests that Rory's past flames remain squarely in, well, the past. And that's a win too, because A. Jess, Logan, and Dean all suck, and B. Fans will finally stop zeroing in on Rory's love life. Where are all the Nobel Peace Prize theories, huh?! \nLet's go through the receipts that led me to this conclusion, shall we? \nLiza Weil gives a very telling interview to Marie Claire . \nWeil, who plays Paris Geller on GG, implied that the show's creator (Amy Sherman-Palladino) approached Rory's old boyfriends as things of her past in the Netflix reboot. \"Amy comes to it from the point of view that none of those previous boyfriends were the right person for Rory,\" Weil said. \"They served a purpose for her during that time in her life, and she hasn't necessarily found 'the person' yet.\" Obviously, this doesn't 100 percent confirm or deny anything. However, it indicates that Logan, Jess, and Dean only exist in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life to provide context for Rory's larger story. And I'm here for that. \nPalladino tells Time magazine she wishes fans weren't so obsessed with Rory's old boyfriends. \n\"Sometimes, I wish that the Dean and Jess thing weren’t so prominent because in the grand scheme of Rory’s life, who her boyfriend was when she was 16 years old is such a small event,\" she said. If Palladino doesn't think Jess and Dean are huge parts of Rory's existence, it seems unlikely she would make either of them her ~person~. And her statement inadvertently implies to Logan, as well. After all, who you want to date at 22 vs. who you want to date at 30 are two drastically different people. \nJared Padalecki (Dean) only worked on Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life for one day. \nUnless his scene was a shotgun wedding with Rory, it seems unlikely that these two end up happily ever after. If Rory does have an adult boyfriend, Palladino would certainly need more than one day to tell his story. Right? \nJess and Rory's reunion in the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life trailer is sterile AF. \nThere's no heat. No sparks. No nothing. There isn't even any fun dialogue—they just repeat the same phrase to each other. If that doesn't scream, \"Oh hi, old friend who I haven't seen in years, let's awkwardly catch up,\" then I don't know what does. \nJess only appears in three episodes of the reboot. Dean appears in one. \nAgain, Rory's future husband would need way more screen time. Logan does appear in all four episodes; however, both Weil and Palladino's quotes support why he is not \"The One.\" \nAnnnd there you have it, folks: To me, this is solid proof that Rory, like many people, does not marry a person she met in high school. Radical, I know. Keywords: ",

      "text": "EXPAND In his recent, Emmy-winning Netflix special Talking for Clapping , Patton Oswalt makes the case that drone strikes have been the most unsettling blemish on the Obama administration. The new documentary National Bird goes even further, following people whose involvement in those strikes have left them with scars more psychological than physical.\nDirector Sonia Kennebeck sets her sights on three particular veterans: Heather, an imagery analyst; Daniel, a private contractor, and Lisa, a former technical sergeant. They spend most of the doc struggling to absolve themselves. They eventually become whistleblowers, putting their lives on the line in order to expose drone-war casualties of not only suspected terrorists but everyday citizens caught as collateral damage. One even goes to Afghanistan to aid in humanitarian work, looking to reclaim her humanity by meeting these people face-to-face.\nFilm Details National Bird Rating: NR Genre: Documentary Running Time: 92 min. Showing Today In: 1 Theater More Info With filmmaking icons Wim Wenders and Errol Morris co-signing as executive producers, National Bird shows that war will always be hell, even for those who aren’t on the battleground. Kennebeck directs with a cold, distant eye, almost giving her subjects the same treatment they gave all those poor souls they targeted.\nViewers already against drone strikes will already agree with what National Bird serves up. But this movie may be an eye-opener for those who thought Obama was sleeping on the job when it came to terrorism. Hell, he may go down as the most terrorist-killing president of all time.\nNational Bird\nDirected by Sonia Kennebeck\nFilmRise\nOpens November 11, Cinema Village\nCourageous Doc 'Disturbing the Peace' Finds Israelis and Palestinian Reach Across the Border PREVIOUS Two-Man Romantic Drama 'Lazy Eye' is Strikingly Sexy and Well Acted NEXT Contact: Craig D.

      "text": "\nMarvel has found great success on Netflix, but their fortunes have been a little mixed on ABC. Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. ‘s ratings have plummeted since the series premiere, Agent Carter was cancelled after just two seasons, and the network pulled the plug on Mockingbird spinoff Marvel’s Most Wanted before the pilot even made it to air.\nIt makes sense then that they’re taking their time with Freeform’s (the rebranded ABC Family) Cloak and Dagger . According to a new report, the show has been pushed back to winter 2018. On the plus side, it does have a showrunner in the form of Joe Pokaski, though he’s writing the pilot’s script from scratch so it obviously needs a bit of work.\nMORE NEWS FROM THE WEB \n\nCloak and Dagger was ordered to series back in April, and is set to focus on Tandy Bowen and Tyrone Johnson, teenagers from different backgrounds who grapple with newly acquired superpowers – Tandy can emit daggers of light, while Tyrone can engulf others in darkness – even as they fall in love. If it sounds a little like a YA novel, that’s because it’s aimed at exactly that audience.\nYou can’t blame Marvel for looking to enter that market, especially as they have Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. on ABC for a mainstream audience and their more grown up shows on Netflix. It’s clearly going to be quite a while before we get any more significant updates on Cloak and Dagger , but it seems to be going well, albeit slowly, so far.\n",

      "text": "What's on Netflix > News > Weekly Highlights Netflix US November 11th Weekly Highlights Netflix US November 11th Tweet \nHalloween is over, it has been a long stressful week, and the holiday frenzy is about to begin. I highly suggest you savor this weekend and escape with your friend Netflix before the madness commences. You deserve it. Start your mini-binge-vacay with Chelsea, but follow my advice: \nIMPORTANT STRESS AVOIDANCE TIP: Episode ‘They Said It’s a Man’s Game” skip to 2:45 to avoid anxiety producing nonsense and get to the good stuff. Carol Burnett is the guest and she is delightful. She talks about the old days, comedy, there are clips, and she tells the best Lucille Ball story. The lady is 83, an icon, and she knows what she is talking about. Tune in. Plus there’s a segment with Chelsea talking to kids which is just funny. Your soul needs some ‘just funny’ at the moment. Now add these to your weekend list: O Brother, Where Art Thou? \nAside from the incredible soundtrack, this movie delivers indie-meets-popcorn star power. Loosely based on Homer’s The Odyssey, the Coen Brothers (Fargo) deliver a Depression-era saga with snappy dialogue (George Clooney) and an intriguing adventure. It’s wacky, a little dark, and has a certain side of southern comfort. You have to just go along for the ride with this one. \nThe Wiz \nJust in time for Thanksgiving, this reimagining of L. Frank Baum’s classic novel The Wonderful Wizard of Oz is just what you need to throw away the cares of the week. Diana Ross is Dorothy, a shy school teacher who gets caught in a blizzard chasing her dog Toto. She is transported to the land of the Big Apple, where she befriends a singing scarecrow, tin man, and lion. They must work together to meet the Whiz (Richard Pryor), the only man powerful enough to send her home. \nTrue Memoirs of an International Assassin Netflix Original \nHear me out. I know you have been burned a time or two by Kevin James. I understand. But give this one a chance. Kevin James is an introvert office worker who escapes the daily grind by writing pulpy spy stories. When his book is picked up and published as nonfiction, he must take on the persona of his character for his own survival. Is it going to win an Oscar? No. Is it fun and entertaining? Yes. Rob Riggle is his usual brash self which just heightens the absurdity of the whole thing. Make some popcorn and just enjoy the laughs. \nKathleen Madigan: Bothering Jesus \nKathleen Madigan, friend of Lewis Black, is always entertaining and has a lot to say. In this latest Netflix special she is as cheeky as ever. She is relatable with a wonderfully sarcastic streak. Her midwest sensibility, family stories, and affinity for Irish pubs is delightful.

      "text": "Courtesy of MediaMall Technologies November 11, 2016 | 11:30AM PT \nNetflix customers have been asking for a way to watch the streamer’s content in offline mode for years. \nNow a third-party service, PlayOn Cloud, is letting subscribers of Netflix — as well as HBO Now , Hulu and others — download TV shows and movies to watch them offline on an iPhone, iPad, PC or Mac. \nThe catch: Users of PlayOn Cloud must pay 99 cents for each episode or movie title they want to watch offline. In other words, downloading, say, the eight episodes of “Stranger Things” season 1 for offline viewing via PlayOn Cloud will cost nearly as much as the standard monthly price of Netflix’s streaming service. In short: not really a great deal. \nNetflix execs have floated the idea of providing built-in offline viewing . But at first, the company is targeting the feature for countries with poor broadband connectivity, chief content officer Ted Sarandos said last week in a CNBC interview . \nAccording to Netflix’s terms of use , subscribers have permission to access to the service “on a streaming-only basis.” MediaMall Technologies , which operates PlayOn, says its service is legal under fair use provisions of copyright law , similar to traditional DVRs like TiVo or network-based DVRs like the service available with Comcast’s X1 . The company also says the service does not circumvent content-security mechanisms and that recordings are restricted to the personal use of each individual user. (Netflix didn’t respond to a request for comment on the PlayOn Cloud launch.) \nIt’s worth noting that Amazon Prime Video has offered offline viewing to members, on both iOS and Android apps, for more than a year. YouTube Red subscribers also have access to videos in offline mode. \nThe PlayOn Cloud iOS app, launched this week, is currently available only in the U.S. The service initially is able to record content from 12 services: Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, Yahoo View, HBO Now, YouTube, NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, PBS and the CW. Users must enter their login credentials for each service in the app. The company says it’s working on an Android version of the app as well. \nWhen a user sets a show to record, the PlayOn service creates a copy and keeps it on its servers for 30 days, functioning as a cloud-based DVR. Customers can download the recording to their mobile device or computer as an MPEG-4 file to watch later when they are disconnected from the internet. The app also includes ad-skipping feature to automatically bypass commercials. \nAs a sign-up promo, PlayOn is offering five free recording credits to users who download the app and create a valid account by Sunday, Nov. 13, at 11:59 p.m. ET. \nSeattle-based MediaMall also offers a service called PlayOn Plus, which uses a Windows PC to store local copies of online video from about 100 services like Netflix, HBO Now and Hulu, and play them back on a range of connected devices. PlayOn Plus is available for $30 per year or a one-time fee of $69.99. Filed Under:",

At first it surprised me, but the films are fundamentally a “good guys vs. bad guys” tale, which matches how little kids see the world. While she’s still too young to watch the films—though we’ve watched the various Rogue One trailers a couple dozen times—she can make do with this genius book from Disney and LucasFilm. First, each of its 11 stories can be read, as the title suggests, in five minutes, which helps at bedtime. Second, the stories turn a scene or scenes from each of the seven Star Wars films into kid-friendly stories. (A couple films, like The Force Awakens , get more than one.) The pod race from The Phantom Menace , for instance, is perfect for that. Ditto Rey meeting BB-8 in The Force Awakens . 5-Minute Star Wars Stories isn’t afraid to go a bit darker, too, but avoids getting scary. When Obi-Wan and Anakin fight Count Dooku in Revenge Of The Sith , Anakin doesn’t kill Dooku; he “defeats” him. (Older kids and adults will get what that means.) They’re all richly illustrated and full of the Star Wars spectacle that easily engrosses young minds. Just be prepared to answer lots of questions about Star Wars mythology and plot when you’re done. [Kyle Ryan] Very British Problems \nA TV show based on a Twitter account lands very low on the list of things I could ever imagine myself enjoying. (Remember $#*! My Dad Says ? Stop remembering it! It was awful!) So I’m surprised to confess that I’ve gotten a very big kick out of Very British Problems , a U.K. television series spun off of the Twitter phenomenon . The show, which is available on Netflix (the only reason I ever gave it a shot—gotta go to sleep to something ), assembles celebrities like James Corden to discuss the eccentricities of British culture, focusing heavily on the mundane rules governing everyday life. Thing is, a lot of the social quirks and niceties they note aren’t specific to Britain; if you’ve ever apologized when someone spilled a drink on you or silently agonized over the awkwardness of holding an elevator (do you privilege the person running for it or respect the time of those already in it?), you’ll appreciate Very British Problems , which could easily be retitled Very Type-A Problems . Although the format is obviously different, this is a series that taps the same comedic vein as Seinfeld , poking fun at the daily frustrations and social neuroses of modern life. I’m a sucker for that kind of precise, observational humor, regardless of which side of the pond it’s ostensibly addressing. [A.A. Dowd] White-noise machine \nI have no trouble falling asleep—I nod off on the bus once a week—but I’m a very light sleeper. Any and all nighttime sounds can and do wake me: breathing, snoring, rustling. (Big thanks for all the fireworks the other night, Chicago neighbors. You can keep your W.) Several years ago, a friend of mine who’d become a first-time parent told me about a white-noise machine she used to drown out ambient noise to help her baby sleep. I’ve since tried a couple of models, but nothing beats the price or efficacy of my HoMedics Sound Spa relaxation machine . I prefer the “waterfalls” setting, which sounds a lot like white noise (that might be why the setting is now just called “white noise”). You can set it for an hour or less, just enough to send me off to dreamland—that is, until the next Chicago sports win. [Danette Chavez]",

      "text": "Comcast subscribers who use the company's X1 platform soon will be able to watch Netflix just like any other cable channel.\nAnnounced earlier this summer, the integration finally appears to be rolling out and will allow cable viewers to browse and watch shows like \"Orange Is the New Black\" straight from their Comcast boxes. Of Comcast's 22.4 million TV subscribers, the deal will affect the roughly half who are (or will soon be) on the X1 platform.\nFor two companies that not long ago were at each other's throats, the deal may come as a surprise. But circumstances are forcing Comcast and Netflix to work together.\nNetflix is facing particular pressure from investors to show it can attract and keep users in the face of rising content costs. In July, analysts widely downgraded the company's stock after Netflix missed its new-subscriber targets by more than 30 percent. Although the streaming service has been expanding rapidly overseas, even that growth has slowed somewhat, and the company has encountered difficulties breaking into China.\nPartnering with Comcast could help Netflix sign up an additional 5 million subscribers in the United States, according to John Blackledge, an industry analyst at Cowen and Company. Although most Comcast X1 users are already Netflix customers, even slight growth around the edges is going to bolster Netflix's bottom line.\nBut the biggest benefit for Netflix, analysts say, may actually be in keeping its existing users tied to the service rather than letting them walk out the door. By deepening the ways in which users can interact with its content, Netflix is looking to stop the bleeding that began when it recently started to raise prices.\nThis is \"more about increasing usage of existing [subscribers],\" said Rich Greenfield, a media analyst at BTIG.\nOn an investor call last month, Netflix chief executive Reed Hastings said the Comcast deal would make Netflix easier for customers to use. \"That increases word-of-mouth,\" he said.\nNetflix isn't the only internet video service that's being hit by departures; its churn rate is among the lowest of its competitors, according to an April survey. But for a company facing such steep expectations as Netflix, demonstrating staying power isn't just a matter of corporate well-being -- it's a sign of how healthy the market is for online streaming overall.\nIn comparison, Comcast has to make the opposite calculation: that the rising popularity of online streaming, however niche, could potentially threaten its traditional video business. With hit shows like \"Narcos\" and \"House of Cards\" being available only on Netflix, Comcast is at risk of losing customer loyalty to the streaming video company. If people grow to love Netflix's shows too much, what's to stop them from canceling their Comcast TV subscription?\nBy putting Netflix on Comcast directly, the cable firm gets to keep consumers more within its own ecosystem. Users will be able to switch on Netflix, for instance, by saying \"Netflix\" into their Comcast-provided, voice-activated remote. And they'll be exposed to traditional cable content right alongside the Netflix content.\n\"Our incredible teams of engineers and designers have come together to create an experience that is ... seamless and intuitive,\" said Neil Smit, Comcast Cable's chief executive.\n  Business Technology Washington Post",

      "text": "Twitter \nNetflix has really ramped up its production of original TV series 13 New Netflix Originals You'll Be Watching in 2016 13 New Netflix Originals You'll Be Watching in 2016 Netflix has released a lot of original content -- including House of Cards, Orange Is the New Black, Narcos, and Master of None -- but 2016 is slated to be Netflix's most exciting year yet. Read More over the past few years, but one could argue that the real cornerstone of Netflix is its massive library of documentaries. Informative, emotional, provocative — you name it, Netflix has it. As this list of the best Netflix documentaries of 2016 proves. \nIndeed, Netflix really knows what people want to watch How Netflix Knows Exactly What You Want to Watch How Netflix Knows Exactly What You Want to Watch Netflix's rise to being the world's primary streaming service was no fluke. It was based on a recipe of data and emotion that means the company always knows what you want to watch. Read More , and high-quality documentaries are surprisingly in demand. And it’s this attention to viewer habits that keeps Netflix ahead of its competitors Netflix vs. Hulu vs. Amazon Prime: Which Should You Choose? Netflix vs. Hulu vs. Amazon Prime: Which Should You Choose? It has been years since we've compared heavy-hitting streaming services, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime. And with changes in pricing, content, quality, and interface, we thought it was time to revisit the topic. Read More . \nWith hundreds of documentaries added to Netflix every year, it can be tough to find time to watch them all. So we’ve picked the 12 best Netflix documentaries of 2016, all to save you the time and trouble of sorting the wheat from the chaff. \nIMDb: 9.0/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 92% \nCharming original animated sequences blend with interviews and archive footage to chronicle the unique career of Disney animator Floyd Norman. \nHired back in 1956 as the first African-American at Disney, Floyd Norman solidified himself as an animator legend through his work on Sleeping Beauty , 101 Dalmatians , and The Jungle Book . Despite forced retirement at age 65, Norman still works at Disney without pay out of sheer love for the drawing board. \nThis wonderful documentary takes you through the ups and downs of Norman’s life, a journey of overcoming struggles and leaving a lasting impact on an entire industry. 2. Keepers of the Game \nIMDb: 8.6/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: N/A \nAs they set their eyes on a championship, an all-Native American girls’ lacrosse team seeks to change their tribe’s attitudes about gender roles. \nDid you know that the sport of lacrosse can be traced back to a Native American tradition among the Iroquois? It began as a ritual symbolic of warfare with heavy spiritual significance — and it was a ritual only for men. \nKeepers of the Game explores the story of an all-female team of Native American players and the obstacles they face — both personal and societal — on their road towards winning a Section Championship. Moving, inspiring, and thought-provoking. \nIMDb: 8.2/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 90% \nThis documentary takes a hard look at how indigenous peoples clashed violently with the Peruvian government over land and economics in the Amazon. \nThere are those out there who will exploit every last inch of land for personal gain, and the conflicts over the Amazon are prime examples of this. But when your homeland is threatened by invasion, what can you do? Run. Or fight. \nIndigenous leader Alberto Pizango chose the latter, standing up to the invasive goals of President Alan Garcia — and in doing so sparked a violent war. The real kicker, though, is how much there is to glean from this film about the state and nature of humanity as a whole. \nIMDb: 8.0/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 96% \nIndomitable activist Ye Haiyan faces increasingly hostile government harassment as she exposes the case of six schoolgirls raped by their headmaster. \nHooligan Sparrow is another documentary that shows how much power can rest in the hands of activists and protesters. In order to bring justice to a rapist principal, Ye Haiyan must overcome the police, the government, and angry community mobs. \nIt’s a dark story that’s made palatable by the courage and conviction shown by Ye Haiyan. How much would you be willing to sacrifice and endure to stand your ground against insurmountable odds? \nIMDb: 7.6/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 88% \nWith stunning views of eruptions and lava flows, Werner Herzog captures the raw power of volcanoes and their ties to indigenous spiritual practices. \nNature documentaries: you either love ’em or hate ’em. But Into the Inferno is a nature documentary like you’ve never seen. Werner Herzog takes you across the world, visiting and exploring the world’s most mythical volcanoes. \nAnd not just the volcanoes, but the indigenous cultures that live around them. We’re talking Indonesia, Ethiopia, and even North Korea. What kind of spiritual connections and relationships have humans developed with these natural wonders? 6. Extremis \nIMDb: 7.5/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: N/A \nWitness the wrenching emotions that accompany end-of-life decisions as doctors, patients, and families in a hospital ICU face harrowing choices. \nExtremis has a runtime under 30 minutes, but that’s more than enough time to break your heart into pieces. I’ve never had to deal with a decision as tough as whether a life should be ended or not, but this documentary made me feel like I now have. \nHow would you react? What would your decisions be? Could you pull the metaphorical trigger? Be warned: this is a heavy and sad watch, but insightful and eye-opening all the same. Keep a few tissues nearby. \nIMDb: 7.4/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 85% \nIn this wrenching documentary, two teens are sexually assaulted by boys they considered friends, humiliated online and harassed by their communities. \nThe effects of sexual assault reach farther than we tend to realize. It can absolutely shatter the lives of the victims, and by no means am I downplaying their trauma, but they aren’t the only ones who suffer either. Friends, families, communities. We’re all affected, many times in hidden ways. \nAudrie & Daisy explores the lives of two underage sexual assault victims and how everything changed for them — not only because of the crime itself, but from the bullying and social pressure that resulted from it. \nIMDb: 7.3/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 100% \nKnown for his spectacular pyrotechnic displays, Chinese artist Cai Guo-Qiang creates his most ambitious project yet in this breathtaking documentary. \nWhat does art look like when gunpowder is the medium of expression? It’s hard to imagine if you’ve never experienced it before, which is why Sky Ladder is such an engrossing watch. Cai Guo-Qiang’s use of fire as art is the perfect kiss of artistry and engineering. Visually stunning and emotionally satisfying. \nIMDb: 7.3/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 89% \nScientists and baseball greats analyze what a batter faces when a pitcher hurls a fastball, which takes less than half a second to reach home plate. \nI find baseball to be the dullest of all sports — so you can imagine my surprise when a documentary about baseball took hold of my attention and refused to let me go. Fastball is, as you might’ve guessed, an 87-minute exploration of the fastball. \nIt may not seem that fast on a TV screen, but a fastball only takes 396 milliseconds to leave the pitcher’s mound and arrive at home plate. This documentary not only pays homage to all the greatest fastball pitchers, but shows you all you need to know about the fastball’s history. 10. The Art of Organized Noize \nIMDb: 7.3/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: N/A \nThe documentary charts the rise of Organized Noize, the influential producers behind megahits from Outkast, Goodie Mob, TLC, and more. \nThe music industry has a lot of unsung heroes. You think an artist’s or a group’s success depends on the artist’s or group’s performance and image, but there are a lot of hidden details and machinations that go on behind the scenes. \nAtlanta-based hip hop production company Organized Noize deserves more credit than they get. Dive into this documentary and find out exactly what they do, how they shaped the entire American hip hop industry, and continue to influence the scene today. 11. My Beautiful Broken Brain \nIMDb: 7.2/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: N/A \nAfter suffering a stroke at age 34, a woman documents her struggles, setbacks, and eventual breakthrough as she relearns to speak, read, and write. \nIt’s terrifying to think of how much your life can change with a single brain injury — and worse yet, not a physical injury but one caused by an event as unexpected as a stroke. But practical impact aside, have you ever wondered what a post-stroke life feels like? \nLotje Sodderland helps us experience what she did, at least to the extent that she can express, and this documentary sheds light on her road to recovery. Brain trauma is a dark subject, but this film is hopeful, positive, and ultimately transformative. \nIMDb: 7.0/10 | Rotten Tomatoes: 89% \nShe was twice convicted and acquitted of murder. Amanda Knox and the people closest to her case speak out in this illuminating documentary. \nDon’t go into this one expecting big answers. What you can expect, however, is a compelling and labyrinthine investigation that will make your question the preexisting assumptions you had as you entered the film. \nIs it the most exciting documentary? No, but it’s up there, and it has its thrilling and suspenseful moments, all leading to a surprisingly emotional end.

      "text": "Enlarge Image This is what your Netflix probably looked like yesterday.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Iyaz Akhtar/CNET We know Netflix runs a lot of testing , sometimes without subscribers even noticing -- most notably changing the title card photos of certain properties often. Now, it's begun testing an interface change on desktop.\nPreviously, if you clicked a piece of content, it would open to an Overview tab where you would see a short synopsis of the show, a look at which episode you're on if any, the option to add it to \"My List\" and a large play button. You had multiple tabs for episodes, more content like it, and more details.\nNow, clicking any piece of content gives you a large overlay and an immediately plays the first or next episode with a short overview underneath the playback.\nOnce you've clicked to open a show, you can scroll to see every episode of that particular season. Playing a movie and then scrolling will show you similar titles or more details, such as the cast, genre, ratings and more.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Caitlin Petrakovitz/CNET When you do scroll for more information or content, whatever you're playing will automatically pause.\nEven though the show or movie begins to play in a scrollable overlay window, after about 10 seconds it seamlessly transitions into the full-window experience you would expect. As another change, once it plays full-width you can scroll to access the details and episode list . Again, scrolling will automatically pauses the content, unless you hit spacebar or press play before continuing down the page.\nPhoto by Screenshot by Caitlin Petrakovitz/CNET Don't worry if you hate it though! There's a way to opt-out of the current (and future) testing.\nWhile logged in on a computer, go to Your Account in the upper right. Under the Settings section on this page you'll see a link for Test participation . On this page you can exclude your account from tests and previews; as Netflix says, \"Turn this off to be shifted to the standard experience now.\" (Or just click here .)\nPersonally, I really like the new interface and the ability to scroll through every episode available. But not everyone is enjoying it quite so much . We've reached out to Netflix for comment and will update this once we hear back.\nIn the meantime, check and see if you're in the test group and let us know: Will you exclude yourself from testing immediately, or do you like the change?",

ARTICLE CONTINUES BELOW \nBy James Gill and Tim Glanfield \nCan't work out what to watch on Netflix UK? Not sure what's new to the service or where to find the best box sets on Netflix? \nWell, hopefully this updated guide to the best TV shows available right now should be a good start. \nFrom top Netflix original series like Stranger Things and House of Cards, great British dramas like Sherlock, Doctor Who and Peaky Blinders to brilliant US and UK comedy, here are the best TV shows to watch on Netflix right now. \nAnd if you still can't work out what to watch, why not check out our guide to the Top 50 Netflix movies available now ? Stranger Things \nThere's a reason why everyone's talking about it; this brilliantly scary horror series following four normal 1980s kids and one telekinetic super-girl is packed with heart. And an inter-dimensional monster that walks through walls. Oh, and an unmissable soundtrack too. Just watch it. Peaky Blinders \nThis Cillian Murphy-starring crime epic has won acclaim all over the world, with everyone from Tom Cruise to the late David Bowie singing its praises. That's quite a broad fanbase, but the Brummie-based 1920s gang series really does have something for everyone. Sharp suits, sharper razor blades, and performances that cut through all the usual bingewatching dross.",

      "title": "We chilled at Netflix’s Singapore headquarters",
      "text": "Philippine Daily Inquirer / 12:04   Lavinia Cheng in her favorite corner of the Netflix office \nI’ve never had throw pillow envy before. But there I was, in Netflix’s Singapore headquarters, seriously considering running off with two pillows—one that read “Official Netflix Connoisseur” and another printed with the definition of the word “netflixing.” (“The act of watching an entire season of a show in one sitting”; “A totally valid excuse for avoiding social obligations”). Netflixing has become my favorite verb in the past months, having just marathoned “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,” “Better Call Saul,” “Stranger Things” and “Narcos” and so it was hard not to fangirl. “This is our office, it’s been open since March,” said Belle Baldoza. ADVERTISEMENT The office, located in the Marina Bay Financial Centre, is home to Netflix’s 50 employees in Singapore. “And we’re still growing,” Belle said. Belle, who is Netflix’s Consumer PR Manager for Asia Pacific, said, “In consumer PR, we are in charge of making people love the Netflix brand. We create a lot of stories, we tap into the pulse of pop culture, seasonal stuff, things people can relate to. We educate people on how to use Netflix and how it’s relevant in their daily lives.” All over their office are bits and pieces of the Netflix brand and the kind of entertainment it has brought to people’s worlds. There’s a beanbag with the word “Netflix” printed all over. On the walls are posters and images from Netflix shows. Meeting rooms, big and small, are named after Netflix originals. Belle Baldoza in her favorite corner of the Netflix office “The entertainment landscape is ever evolving. Entertainment habits are changing. It’s not about linear watching anymore. You have the liberty of watching the shows at your own pace and you can watch them all in one go. That’s what we’re all about—we’re all about enabling, not only enabling consumer control and enabling people to watch anytime anywhere, letting them fall in love with the shows at their own pace, but at the same time we’re enabling creative freedom for creators because we let the narrative breathe,” said Belle. For Netflix employees, this means watching their favorite shows even at work. “People catch up on shows at lunch,” said Lavinia Cheng, Netflix PR coordinator. Some of them do it at their work stations while others watch at their comfy lounge. “We also watch at Fuller House, that room with the TV which looks like a living room. When we want to watch a show as a team and then talk about it after, we do it there,” said Belle. And in case they like snacking while watching (or working), their pantry is fully stocked with all kinds of goodies—from sandwich condiments, cup noodles and cornflakes to chocolates, chips and fruits. The office takes care of lunch too. “At Netflix, everyone is treated like an adult. Our core values include freedom and responsibility. We can technically work wherever as long as the work gets done. We don’t really have leave days so you can take your vacation time off as long as you’ve handed over your work.” For just a morning, I got a little taste of life in Netflix. We sat and watched movie clips and looked at stills of upcoming shows and talked about “Luke Cage” (“He’s not your usual Marvel superhero, he’s a street level hero, he’s not a costumed dude, he has his internal struggle and killer soundtrack,” said Belle), “Girlboss” (“It’s coming out in 2017”), “A Series of Unfortunate Events” (“We have Neil Patrick Harris as Olaf”), “The Crown” and “Santa Clarita Diet,” which will star Drew Barrymore. A peek at the fridge in the pantry; One of the many cozy spots (love that Netflix beanbag) —PHOTOS BY PAM PASTOR Sure, freedom, food and fun are great things, but for Belle and Lavinia, working at Netflix has even bigger perks. Lavinia said, “We’re a tech company as much as we’re an entertainment company. It’s a very good environment, we talk about the technology behind how we bring the service to the people.” Belle said, “I’m excited to be part of bringing the entertainment revolution to the Philippines, to be a part of that team. As a Filipino, I grew up watching a lot of TV and it’s been a huge part of my life. I’m very, very excited to see more Filipinos discovering the wonders of Netflix and all the different stories it has to offer. I just want the people to discover the stories.” Excerpts from our interview: What’s the coolest part about working in Netflix? Lavinia: Definitely getting to see some of the shows first. As a fan of all the shows, being in the know of what’s coming up is very, very exciting. We have so much lined up. Belle: As a pop culture junkie, it’s the ability to tap into anything that’s relevant. I think our shows right now are so relevant, each of them has a firm place, whether it’s “The Get Down” or “Stranger Things” or “Orange is the New Black.” Everything has a place in pop culture and I love to be part of that on a daily basis. What do you love about going to this office every day? Lavinia: I actually love the pantry. (laughs) This pantry has everything. When lunch time comes, people get so excited. Which other corners of the office do you like? Belle: I really like that chair that looks out to the bay. Whenever I need to write something, I sit in that chair. Lavinia: It’s a little nest. Which shows are you obsessed with right now? Belle: For me it’s “Black Mirror.” Lavinia: Same. Belle: “Black Mirror” and after I finished “Narcos” season 2, I felt like there was a void in my life. I was like, “So what now?” If you can force people to watch a show on Netflix, which one would it be? Belle: This one’s really hard. It’s like picking your favorite album. Fine, three shows. Lavinia: “Stranger Things” is definitely one of them just because the storytelling in that show is unbelievable and I love the cast, they’re so adorable. The ’80s throwback is so relevant to our generation. The second one I think is “The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.” It’s one of those light-hearted things that I love and the third I think would be “Narcos.” It’s a good mix of the serious stuff and the light-hearted stuff. Belle: “Narcos” is a documentary, a film, a series all rolled into one. That’s my number one. Second would be “Black Mirror,” I’m obsessed with it. Third would be “The Get Down.” It’s full of music and anyone who has been involved in the process of creating music or making art come alive should watch the show because it illustrates that struggle perfectly. Lavinia: But that was a tough choice. I have so many other shows… Belle: It’s just so hard. Do you have a cool office you want us to visit?

      "text": "Joel Kinnaman will star in Netflix ’s sci-fi series “Altered Carbon,” Variety has learned. \nMiguel Sapochnik (“Game of Thrones”) is set to direct the first episode of the 10-episode series, which was ordered earlier this year by the streaming giant. Related Netflix Picks Up Futuristic Sci-Fi Series ‘Altered Carbon’ Based on Book \n“ Altered Carbon ” is based on Richard K. Morgan’s 2002 novel of the same name. The futuristic series is set in the 25th century when the human mind has been digitized and the soul is transferable from one body to the next. Kinnaman will play Takeshi Kovacs, a former elite interstellar warrior known as an Envoy who has been imprisoned for 500 years and is downloaded into a future he had tried to stop. If he can solve a single murder in a world where technology has made death nearly obsolete, he’ll get a chance at a new life on Earth. \nThe sci-fi series hails from Skydance Television. Laeta Kalogridis is writing, serving as showrunner and exec producer, along with Skydance’s David Ellison, Dana Goldberg and Marcy Ross. \nKinnaman is no stranger to Netflix. He stars in the most recent season of “House of Cards.” He’s also known for “The Killing,” plus films “Robocop,”“Run All Night” and “Safe House.” Up next, he’s starring in the hotly anticipated “Suicide Squad,” which hits theaters on August 5. \nKinnaman is repped by WME and Magnolia Entertainment.

      "text": "Next 1 of 6 Prev post Use your ← → (arrows) to browse Netflix’s library of original and exclusive content keeps growing, and it has plenty of gems for you to discover. Here are five to check out this weekend. \nThe weekend has arrived, and with it, hopefully, some free time. Fortunately, Netflix is still there. You may not have noticed, but the service has really committed to exclusives. Bloomberg projects that it’ll spend nearly $5 billion this year alone on its programming, and other projections by the Motley Fool put the originals part of that budget at over $1 billion. \nSo, for this week’s edition of movies to Netflix and chill to, we’ll showcase 5 movies you can find only on Netflix. \nNetflix genres: Thrillers, Psychological Thrillers, Mysteries \nRating: TV-14 \nRuntime: 1 hour, 29 minutes \nReleased: 2016 \nAs our sister site, Netflix Life , reports, I Am the Pretty Thing that Lives in the House represents the very first Netflix Original horror film. (The movie also earned a spot on the best horror movies list.) However, Pretty Thing doesn’t go for gore to deliver the scares, as evidenced by the relatively tame TV-14 rating. \nOur protagonist is Lily, a young caregiver hired to tend to Iris Blum, a horror novelist who has found herself confined to bed. Although things seem fine at first, Lily soon starts to suspect that Iris’ tales might be closer to reality than to fiction. \nAs evidenced by the TV-14 rating, the film does not get really get gory as some of its higher-rated fellow horror movies do. Instead, it focuses on the atmosphere and the psychological horror of it all. \nPair with something like Stonehearst Asylum , also available on Netflix.

      "text": "Bright Rex/Shutterstock \nActress Ashley Bell has been cast as the lead in the film Next Door from MarVista Entertainment. Directed by Kenny Gage and Devon Downs, the film is about a young woman who accepts an offer from her therapist neighbor to be treated for free and thinks she’s found the perfect situation. But the more she learns about her seemingly altruistic savior, the more she begins to fear for her safety. Adam Rockoff wrote the pic with Kimberly A. Ray producing. Bell most recently starred in this summer’s indie film Carnage Park from IFC and has also completed production on Mickey Keating’s Psychopaths . Bell is repped by Untitled, Gersh and Stone, Genow, Smelkinson. David Ayer-Helmed Thriller 'Bright' Adds Andrea Navedo; Austin Hébert Cast In 'Burden' \nSuicide Squad actor Alex Meraz is reuniting with David Ayer and Will Smith in the Netflix film Bright .

Eric Newman, Ayer, Landis and Bryan Unkeless are producing the pic, which will debut on the streaming giant in 2017. In addition to Suicide Squad , Meraz’s film credits include The Twilight Saga films and Bone Tomahawk . He is repped by Innovative and Corner Booth Entertainment. \n",

      "text": "View this image › NBC I recently binged the shit out of this underrated Netflix epic. Based on the book by prolific British novelist Bernard Cornwell, The Last Kingdom follows Uhtred, a Saxon-born warrior raised by Vikings on a quest to regain his English land and avenge his adoptive father. It’s perfect if you’re a GOT or Outlander fan going through a dry-spell, and it’s only eight episodes so you can polish the whole thing off in a weekend. (Be warned, the leading man has nearly unbearable hero-with-a-hot-head complex, but it’s still good fun and the supporting cast more than make up.) \nWatch it on Netflix . \nIf you’d like something a bit less violent, Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is back with a new season a new theme song, also on Netflix UK . ID: 9939353 2. Read Saving Grace by Grace Wilson. Loading instagram.com Ailbhe reccomends this one in her weekly self-care tips : “If you’ve ever felt a bit lost, or like all your friends are doing better than you, then read Saving Grace by Grace Wilson. This short graphic novel tells the tale of four twenty-something friends, with plenty of familiar real-life details (like the cans of red stripe in the background of a grubby kitchen). It’s a quick read and the illustrations are so bright and detailed that it rewards a re-read the next day.” \nIf that doesn’t appeal, I’m diving back into the Harry Potter books this week for some much needed comfort and a reminder to keep fighting for good. ID: 9939358 3. Listen to this playlist with serious November vibes. Spotify \nFor an excellent not-quite-autumn-not-quite-winter soundtrack, look no further than this expertly curated list . There’s something for everyone, so you’re bound to find a new jam or two to get you through the cold. \nIn other news, The Shins recently released their first single since 2012 and I for one couldn’t be happier. ID: 9939359 4. Play Level With Me. \nThis adorable game will keep you busy on commutes and is insanely addicting. It’s simple enough: beat mini games to keep your surface level in the face of heavy bowling balls, dynamite, zombies, and more.",

      "text": "Trisha Faulkner \nScripps Network Interactive has made the decision not to renew their content contract with Netflix . This means shows on HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, and DIY will all be pulled from the Netflix library. \nAccording to Cinema Blend , Netflix has been removing content from their library left and right in the last few months. A large portion of the reason why Netflix has removed so much of the content is to replace it with Netflix Originals. Some of the content being removed, however, is simply because Netflix doesn’t want to dish out a ton of cash to keep offering users the content. Netflix Losing Food Network, HGTV, Travel Channel Shows at End of 2016 https://t.co/RWLvqk01aP \n— Variety (@Variety) November 9, 2016 \nDigital Trends reports that it wasn’t Netflix who made the decision to end the contract with Scripps Network Interactive. Some are speculating this may have not been a contract Netflix wanted to lose as it means a number of shows will be pulled from the library. Netflix lost the Scripps Network Interactive contract which means pulling shows from HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, and DIY because the COO of the company did not feel that the content contract was as beneficial to them as it was to Netflix. The COO claims the decision not to extend the Scripps Network Interactive contract with Netflix was a strategic one. \n“In the end, it really is not the kind of dual-revenue model that best monetizes our content over the long term.” \nNetflix has yet to make a comment in regards to the losing the contract with Scripps Networks Interactive. Scripps Networks Interactive, however, has been adamant about the fact that they believe they are doing what is best for their company and do not believe the contract with Netflix does a good job of monetizing their content anymore. Fans of shows that air on HGTV, Food Network, Travel Channel, Cooking Channel, and DIY will just have to wait and see if Scripps Networks Interactive has any plans in regards to how viewers can get more on demand access to the content. Food Network, Cooking Channel and HGTV say goodbye to Netflix. #FWx https://t.co/pdoJzcyRAR pic.twitter.com/s6nRXmKjN6 \n— Food & Wine (@foodandwine) November 12, 2016 \nRelated Stories On Netflix",

      "text": "Coursera You? Look for an answer beyond the obvious. Netflix is not in business of renting out / streaming movies, it is in business of understanding viewing habits of people. Similarly, Coursera is in business of understanding learning behaviour of people. So, now again, Which business are you in? In answering so, you might figure out that the real differentiator to your business is different from the traditional business model you had in your mind. In today’s landscape, a credit card provider is not in a business of a Financial risk management. It is important, but its true business is likely to be understanding consumer spending. If they provide a spending offer a month after the customer needs it, they are doomed! Question 2: Can data / behaviour insights change the way you do or look at your business? Now that you have probably listed down which business are you in, you need to check how much data do you own in that business. Following are the questions you need to answer: Do you own the data and journey? If yes, can you increase the ownership? Can you store more information which can provide you information about what the customer wants? If no, how do you start owning the data and the journey? If you get insights on consumer behaviour, what kind of changes can you make today? What do you think is the potential revenue opportunity there? Question 3: Do you want to build in-house data capability or Outsource? The answer depends on how much importance / differentiating capability you attach to Analytics in your core strategy and how much revenue opportunity you put on it. While it is easy to take decisions on the extremes, it might be more difficult to make decisions if you lie somewhere in between. There are several hybrid models, which might work if you lie somewhere in between. Question 4: Do you need to invest in people or you have the required talent in-house? This might as well be a Question 3 b. Once you are clear whether you need to Outsource or not and in what capacity, you need to do a reality check versus your current talent pool. Needless to emphasize the importance of this step. Scenario 1: If you think you have the right talent in-house, you should ask: Why have we not started the journey already? What have been the results of past initiatives these people / team have led? Scenario 2: You do not have the right talent inhouse. In this case, create a job description, find out relevant candidates, take time to understand their perspective, involvement in transition in previous companies and ability to lead change. Question 5: What should be the plan for roll-out of this initiative? Once you have all the above questions answered, you need to think about how would you go about penetrating Analytics to the level in your Organization you really want? Following are some of the guidelines in creating this action plan: Identify specific problems (hopefully core of what business are you in) and work on those problems Communicate your vision to your team and create a buy-in with them Identify a few low hanging fruits to increase engagement with business Once you have answers to these questions, hopefully you will have all the weapons you need to create an action plan. Here are a couple of case studies with a few CEOs and their answers to the five questions: Case study: Credit card provider: Question 1: What business are you in? There are 3 parts which define the core of our business proposition: Identifying the right risk profile of customers to be underwritten on right products Managing the customer life cycle effectively and efficiently. Some of the questions we try and answer here are: Can we anticipate when a good customer needs an offer to shift his big spends on to our cards? Can we identify transactions which illustrate worsening risk for customer? Managing Fraud: This is another space where application of big data comes in place. What are the patterns which might indicate dubious behaviour? Question 2: Can data / behaviour insights change the way you do or look at your business? For us, mining data to bring out behavioural insights is the core of solving business problems. We place a very high value on any insight generated in each of these areas highlighted above. We typically own the entire data in this journey, which is a big advantage compared to some other industries. We are increasing moving to a space where data is looked at as an asset on Balance sheet of our Organization. Question 3: Do you want to build in-house data capability or Outsource? For us the answer was very evident. Once we were clear on the value, the question was about finding the right talent to build in-house capabilities. Question 4: Do you need to invest in people or you have the required talent in-house? We invested heavily in specialists to build our analytics expertise. The Leadership team was actively involved in screening the candidates themselves. Once the team was in place, managing their attrition has been a key priority for our Organization. Question 5: What should be the plan for rollout of this initiative? Since, we were convinced about the value Analytics can add and there are Organizations across globe who have already created differentiation based on data (e.g. Capital One, American Express), we started work on key strategic areas immediately. While we did not necessarily look out for low hanging fruits, speed to execution was really key for us. If we know about a trend which might signify potential fraud, it had to be implemented quickly. You cannot sit on information like this. So, what do you think about these questions? Would they help you provide direction in setting up an Analytics practice? Are there additional factors you would want to answer in initial stages of starting a data practice? Do let me know your thoughts.

      "text": "\nWhile The Crown is a Netflix series based on the actual life of Queen Elizabeth II, this article might reveal some spoilers if you haven’t watched the full series.\nIf it seemed as though the new Netflix series The Crown is the right medicine for the Downton Abbey flu, well that would make sense, because there is some interesting overlap that is not immediately evident. As we see flashbacks of Queen Elizabeth’s childhood and perhaps her grandest hobby, her horses, we meet a man from her past who is the link to Downton Abbey. \nThe Crown is not just providing people with entertainment, but also with a history lesson that many have missed about the abdication of King Edward VIII, says the Inquisitr. King Edward, known to his family as David, was the playboy king who gave up the throne to marry the love of his life, Wallis Warfield Simpson, an American woman who was already twice divorced. While The Crown doesn’t cover the abdication, it deals with the aftermath, which shows Queen Elizabeth II’s relationship with the uncle whose choices set her reign in motion.\n'The Crown' is the stepchild spawn of Downton Abbey and House of Cards. My take: https://t.co/2EqNrE1okM pic.twitter.com/yHzi3QAIfw \n— shinan govani (@shinangovani) November 3, 2016 \n\nAlmost at the end of season one of The Crown , we meet a new character in the Queen Elizabeth saga, Lord Carnarvon, or “Porchie,” who is the queen’s racing manager in charge of her stables according to Vanity Fair . Porchie, is short for Porchester as in Lord Porchester, which is what he was before inheriting his father’s title, Lord Carnarvon.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix Things Viewers Of Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Need To Know About Wallis… Netflix ‘The Crown’ Season 2 Is Official, But The Main Cast Is Being… It seems Porchie had a thing for Elizabeth back when she was Princess Elizabeth, but she only had eyes for Philip. Queen Elizabeth tells Prince Philip when he shows some jealousy for the bond that she and Porchie share, that Porchie is family, and has been around so long he is “part of the furniture.” Prince Philip responds that it’s fine, as long as she doesn’t sit on him.\nNo te extrañe si llegamos a ver Downton Abbey en The Crown. Existe causa justificada https://t.co/FBSLBZRtTO \n— Diana (@dipordior) November 12, 2016 \n\nThe Crown does not suggest that Queen Elizabeth actually had an affair with Porchie, but they do hint at some chemistry, and they more than hint that it bothers Prince Philip, who was nobody’s first choice for the husband of the heir to the throne.\n“I have nothing to hide from you. Nothing. Porchie is a friend, and yes, there are those who would have preferred me to marry him. Indeed, marriage with him might have been easier, might have even worked better than ours.”\nBut, in response to what is perhaps Prince Philip’s deflection about his own infidelity (we often see a drunken, partying Philip, rolling in and out of English convertible sports cars) Queen Elizabeth gets quite frank with the prince.\n“But to everyone’s regret and frustration, the only person I have ever loved is you. And can you honestly look me in the eye and say the same?”\nWhich leads to why Porchie was preferred and how The Crown and Downton Abbey have something in common. Though Philip was a prince, he had a rough upbringing for a royal, as his father was nearly executed, and the family was driven out of Greece, and virtually homeless for much of Philip’s life, until he was taken in by his uncle, Lord Mountbatten (call me Dickie), and dropped his own very German sounding surname of Uncle Dickie’s name, Mountbatten (a reworking of his mother’s family name, Battenberg).\nPorchie on the other hand, was born Henry George Reginald Molyneux Herbert, the son of the sixth Earl, Porchie was schooled at Eton, and a serving member of the Royal Horse Guards during World War II. Porchie had all of the bells and whistles, plus the cute WASPy nickname. But here is where the Downton Abbey thing kicks in, Porchie was born at Highclere Castle, which is the estate known as Downton Abbey, the home of Lord Grantham and family in the ITV/PBS series of the same name. Highclere is Porchie’s ancestral family home.\nThe Crown really is quite good – a perfect blend of House of Cards and Downton Abbey. https://t.co/BbrCwx2uCc \n— Matt Cadwallader (@mattcad) November 10, 2016 \n\nAs a child, Princess Elizabeth spent time at Highclere Castle as a guest of the Carnarvon family, which is one reason that Queen Elizabeth loved Downton Abbey .\n“She loves watching Downton Abbey and pointing out things they have got wrong, partly because she is familiar with Highclere Castle, where it is filmed.”\nAnd that is the far less than six degrees of separation for the English aristocracy.\nAre you surprised to see how the worlds of The Crown and Downton Abbey collide?\n[Featured Image by PRNewsFoto/Crystal Cruises/AP Images]\nNetflix’s ‘The Crown’ And ‘Downton Abbey’ Have A Connection is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "Post by leaping lizard on Nov 12, 2016 21:43:57 GMT -5 I just started watching this show on Netflix--just one episode in--so please, no spoilers! Anyway, you know there's that saying, where there's smoke there's fire? Trump has a lot of smoke in various places. Tying into the vibe of the show, I was thinking, the Republicans in charge know about it and are able to control Trump so that this stuff gets swept under the rug/delayed/goes away. (There was that death threat of the person who was raped at the age 13 afterall.) If he does their bidding. Or they can impeach him. They've got complete control to call the shots and he is just the face/spokesperson. I've often suspected as much with Reagan, and definitely suspected this with W (as many others have as well). What do you think? It's just a theory, not at this point, anyway.",

      "text": "\nPart of fully embracing the new Netflix series The Crown is knowing the players. While many viewers have heard some of the names before, they are hearing the actual stories of the family Windsor for the first time. And people know Queen Elizabeth, first because she is still the Queen of England, and also, because unlike her younger sister, Princess Margaret, she is still alive. But people are learning that Princess Margaret was the wild child of her generation.\nAnother member of the Windsor family who was controversial was Wallis Warfield Simpson , the Duchess of Windsor or “that woman” if you as the Queen Mum, says the Inquisitr . But the most important thing to know is that Wallis was the woman that tipped the boat that was the House of Windsor. King Edward VIII abdicated the throne to marry the twice divorced woman from Baltimore Maryland who was thought to be the ultimate gold digger.\nVanessa Kirby is slaying as Princess Margaret #TheCrown pic.twitter.com/P3nY2gJQKj \n— বাংলার গান গাই (@kowshik4mBD) November 12, 2016 \n\nSure, the scandal of the abdication of King Edward VIII looms large in the Netflix series The Crown , but in the first season, the second royal scandal was Princess Margaret’s dalliance with a married man, Captain Peter Townsend , says Vanity Fair. For years, Princess Margaret jumped through hoops to be with her then divorced lover, but it was not meant to be, unless she wanted to pack up and leave town like Uncle David.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nThings Viewers Of Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Need To Know About Wallis… \nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix \nNetflix’s ‘The Crown’ And ‘Downton Abbey’ Have A Connection \nAnne de Courcy wrote about the Princess Margaret/Peter Townsend romance in the biography of Princess Margaret’s eventual husband, Lord Snowden.\n“When Townsend accompanied the royal family on a tour of South Africa in 1947, the two were in each other’s company every day. “We rode together every morning in that wonderful country, in marvelous weather,” the Princess told a confidante. “That’s when I really fell in love with him’.”\nAfter Queen Elizabeth took the throne, Princess Margaret moved to Clarence House with her mother, but had her own apartment there, so it was easier to hide her affair with Townsend than it was in the palace.\nPrincess Margaret’s Affair on The Crown Has a Heartbreaking, Real-Life Backstory https://t.co/jnMQ97K1R0 \n— Dr.Grimm (@FairyTalesEtc) November 12, 2016 \n\nQueen Elizabeth really tried to find a way that the beloved Townsend and her sister could marry, and at first sent Townsend to work in Belgium to buy some time.\n“Princess Margaret told her sister, the Queen, that she wanted to marry the airman. Soon afterward, Elizabeth II began to sound out her ministers on the possibility of amending the Regency Act in such a way as to ease the restrictions on Margaret’s marriage.”\nBut the reason that Princess Margaret finally decided not to marry Peter Townsend was that the conditions for her were actually going to be worse than they were for Uncle David, as Princess Margaret would forfeit her allowance, and could not return to England for at least five years.\nprincess margaret, queen elizabeth's sister, was so hot when she was younger pic.twitter.com/fOurebiK6K \n— gillyflower (@assuplouis) November 12, 2016 \n\nPrincess Margaret put out a statement that explained that she was ending her relationship with Townsend, after being told of what would happen if she did, and that it was bad enough that Uncle David chose love over his country, and that it would be shameful if she did too.\n“I would like it to be known that I have decided not to marry Group Capt. Peter Townsend. Mindful of the Church’s teaching that Christian marriage is indissoluble, and conscious of my duty to the Commonwealth, I have resolved to put these considerations before any others.”\nDo you think there was a double standard that would have punished Princess Margaret more than King Edward VIII for marrying a divorced person?\n[Featured Image by West End Salons/AP Images]\nWhat Netflix ‘The Crown’ Viewers Need To Know About Princess Margaret is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

      "text": "\nThe holidays are just around the corner and Netflix is streaming a few Thanksgiving themed movies that involve turkey day and the drama that often surrounds it. Two are comedies, one is a horror film, and another a crime drama, so whatever your tastes, it is almost certain one of the following movies will quench your entertainment appetite after a big holiday meal.\nDutch (1991) Rated PG-13 \nShot in the same vein as Planes, Trains, and Automobiles , the John Hughes comedy Dutch features a unique road trip involving Dutch Dooley (Ed O’Neill) and his young charge Doyle Standish (Ethan Embry). The pairing occurs because Dutch is dating Natalie Standish (JoBeth Williams), who is Doyle’s mother.\nMovie night pick: Dutch (1991). 1 of my favorite Thanksgiving movies. We need more John Hughes type movies. pic.twitter.com/FlzAulTYBL \n— Lindsey Jones (@Laj93) November 5, 2016 \n\nHer wealthy ex-husband Reed Standish (Christopher McDonald) informs Natalie she must host Doyle, who attends a Georgia boarding school, for Thanksgiving because Reed has business to attend to in London. Doyle, a snobbish child, blames his mother for his parents’ divorce and is angry he won’t be with his father for the holidays.\nNew review, \"Dutch\" (1991) starring Ed O'Neill, Ethan Embry https://t.co/AslypTgmqg #filmreview #Thanksgiving #Dutch pic.twitter.com/NIGZR98T5P \n— The Movie Buff (@The_Movie_Buff) November 26, 2015 \n\nHilarity ensues as Dutch volunteers to retrieve Doyle from school and bring him back to Natalie’s Chicago home to celebrate Thanksgiving.\nPretty movie locations….\nSeen in 1991 film DUTCH\nLocation is Big Daddy Fireworks in Guild Tennessee #neon #sign pic.twitter.com/CqNOPnyKd3 \n— SCENEPAST apps (@SCENEPAST) May 7, 2016 \n\nAmidst the tension between Dutch and Doyle, mishaps take place on the road, including a fireworks disaster, a totaled car, devious prostitutes, and aggressive security guards. In the end, Doyle confronts his father when he discovers the truth about his business trip and learns a valuable lesson about family and the holidays. Although it garnered a 3.5 out of 10 on Rotten Tomatoes , it is worth a watch.\nSon in Law (1993) Rated PG-13 \nOne film likely not remembered as being a Thanksgiving themed movie is the comedy Son in Law starring Pauly Shore (Encino Man, Bio-Dome), who was a hot commodity at the time the film was made. This screwball comedy involves an innocent South Dakota farm girl, Rebecca (Carla Gugino), who is a fish out of water living in a coed dorm while attending college in California. Her unusual resident advisor, Crawl (Shore), helps her adjust to this strange environment by giving her a makeover from head to toe after she threatens to quit school and head home. Due to her gratitude to Crawl, she invites him home to celebrate Thanksgiving on the farm.\nPauly Shore's Son in Law ( 1994) still makes me laugh so much. Such ridiculous movie. #theweasel pic.twitter.com/J9C2Tjeyys \n— Eddie Harran (@eddieharran) July 13, 2016 \n\nHer family sees how much Rebecca has changed, including her boyfriend Travis (Dan Gauthier), who is planning to propose. She realizes Travis is not the man for her and encourages Crawl to give her a hand with this dilemma. Crawl, unsure of what to say, proclaims that he and Rebecca are already engaged.\nMy movie, Son in Law >>> this seriously made my night… I LOVE Pauly Shore pic.twitter.com/aN1up3Aj \n— Lyndsey Chadwick (@lyndslovin) January 26, 2013 \n\nFollowing the family’s shock at this revelation, Crawl learns the ways of the farm and Travis is dead set on getting revenge, resulting in misunderstandings, heartache, and understanding.\nKristy (2013) Not Rated \nIf you and your relatives are not in the mood for cheery family fare on this Thanksgiving holiday, and horror is your genre of choice, Kristy is the film for you. According to IMDB , the movie Kristy was directed by Oliver Blackburn , and revolves around Justine (Haley Bennett), a college student who can’t afford to fly back home to celebrate the Thanksgiving holiday, so she’s virtually left alone on campus as the rest of the student body takes leave.\n@jeanelljuststop Kristy – if you are looking for horror movie. I suggest this film. The ending was sick! pic.twitter.com/Z6tHTvfhtE \n— jeanell (@jeanelljuststop) August 5, 2016 \n\nIt appears the only other living being on the entire campus is lone security guard Wayne (Mathew St. Patrick), who is responsible for ensuring the vast grounds are safe. When evening comes, Justine, feeling antsy, heads to the local convenience store for some junk food and there encounters a strange young woman, Violet (Ashley Greene) who calls her “Kristy.” On the return drive to her dorm, Justine notices a strange car in the road but makes it back safely to campus.\n*Sees #Kristy *\nDamn that was good\nNow I want to see Haley Bennett as Newt for the Alien movie pic.twitter.com/4QcXLgrtqY \n— Nickolas (@niklander2) October 30, 2016 \n\nWhile in her dorm, Justine hears unsettling noises and suddenly becomes disconnected from the Internet. Tension follows as Violet shows up, along with some masked men, resulting in a game of cat and mouse across the college campus, filled with intentional scares and unpredictability.\nDeadfall (2012) Rated R \nLike Kristy, Deadfall is not really a holiday film, but a crime drama in which its characters just want to make it to Thanksgiving dinner in one piece. The movie takes place as Jay (Charlie Hunnam) is on his way home to his parents house for the holiday after a recent release from prison. Jay is a former boxer and while in Detroit, he demands his coach pay him the money he’s owed. A fight ensues and Jay thinks he’s killed his coach in the process, so fearing he will be sent back to prison, he takes off. At the same time, Liza (Olivia Wilde), and her brother Addison (Eric Bana) are on the run in Michigan after a botched casino heist.\nWhat a great movie Deadfall #Netflix #CharlieHunnam #KrisKristofferson pic.twitter.com/qkCYLUdBWy \n— micheleabella (@Kittie56Michele) August 20, 2016 \n\nThey part ways after a car accident and subsequent murder, causing Jay to encounter a cold and alone Liza who agrees to spend Thanksgiving with him. While out of Jay’s presence, Liza messages her brother Addison the address of Jay’s parents.\n@ECharlieHunnam @HunnamDaily @SOAAddicts – Hunnam in Deadfall – another awesome movie pic.twitter.com/Zsk92mFF3d \n— JaxTellersOldLady (@Treyceigh) January 17, 2016 \n\nIn the meantime, Addison has been involved in several violent encounters but manages to make his way to holiday dinner where the group has an unexpected fateful encounter.\n[Featured Image by 20th Century Fox]\nThanksgiving Themed Movies For Almost Every Appetite Streaming On Netflix is an article from: The Inquisitr News \n",

A charming waitress catches his eye as she presents him with a glass of whisky \nPhilip, played by former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, is seen at a gentleman’s club in London’s Soho district – then a hotbed of vice – when he behaves in a style very different from his public image as an ever-dutiful husband. \nThe bar scene plays out in the sixth episode, when the Duke of Edinburgh joins his close friend and private secretary Mike Parker at the club. A charming waitress catches his eye as she presents him with a glass of whisky. \nIt’s not the only time his eyes wander in the series. On a flight home from a Royal visit, he has his head turned by an air stewardess. The Queen, played by Claire Foy, catches him staring at her and gives him a withering look. \nIn another scene, Philip joins Parker for a boys’ weekend at short notice. When the Queen asks where he is going, Philip replies defensively: ‘It’s gentlemen only… It’s perfectly innocent.’ Her Majesty looks stern-faced from a window of Buckingham Palace as Philip roars down the drive in his sports car and Parker pops a bottle of champagne. \nPhilip can't help but admire the waitress from behind as she walks away from him \nIt’s not the only time his eyes wander in the series. On a flight home from a Royal visit, he has his head turned by an air stewardess \nThe Queen, played by Claire Foy, catches him staring at her and gives him a withering look. \nIn another scene, Philip joins Parker for a boys’ weekend at short notice and the pair roar down the drive in Philip's sports car and Parker pops a bottle of champagne \nThe strain on the Royal couple’s marriage is a common theme in The Crown. During one explosive argument, the Queen questions Philip’s commitment to her. Her voice cracking with emotion, she says: ‘The only person I’ve ever loved is you – but can you honestly look me in the eye and say the same?’ \nShe storms out of the room when Philip, staring at her in stunned silence, fails to reply. \nRoyal observers have taken exception to Philip’s portrayal. Author Thomas Blaikie said: ‘This is a just bit Carry On. I really don’t imagine that he ever indulged in such laddish behaviour. Philip might play up to his man-about-town image and he likes female company, but it’s all good fun and harmless.’",

Bryce Dallas-Howard in the “Black Mirror” episode “Nosedive,” in which everyone’s quality of life depends on their social media standing. (David Dettmann/Netflix) TERESA M. PELHAM Special to The Courant \nIf there's any doubt in your mind that technology is taking over our kids' lives, you need to watch a couple of episodes of \"Black Mirror,\" a Netflix series that's meant to freak you out in the same way \"The Twilight Zone\" did a generation ago. \nBefore you settle in to watch, however, turn on every light in the house, and do not take any type of mind-altering drug. It might also be wise to invite over a friend skilled in handling mental health crises and bouts of paranoia. \nThe premise of this thriller is that new technologies are controlling our every move. What makes this show especially creepy is that it's all actually feasible in today's world. \nThe first episode I dare you to watch is \"Nosedive.\" It's pretty much what Instagram has done to half of the students in our nation's high schools. Everything you post to social media is done purely to affect your social standing. Your looks, your lifestyle, your possessions: All up for approval. \nEverything revolves around one's rating. The more five star ratings one gets, the better your average. But negative social interactions can immediately translate into a low rating. Smile and look pretty and you're ahead of the game. It's like Yelp for people. \nThe lead in this episode is a young woman who wants to move into a new, trendy apartment, but her rating is averaging out to a 4.2, and the apartment doesn't allow anything below a 4.5. \"Lacie\" meets with a consultant who gives her advice that will boost her numbers. \nIn real life, a high number of likes and shares won't affect where you live, but it certainly will boost your ego and your popularity. (OMGeeee! You're so pretty!) I found myself laughing at the absurdity of the show, then realizing it's exactly what happens every day to our kids (and to a lesser degree, to us.) \nBy the end of the episode I was ready to ditch my social media accounts, but then realized I needed to post a totally cute picture of a heart-shaped cappuccino design. I got 47 likes! \nIn \"Shut Up and Dance,\" the episode I watched last night before reconsidering the security software on the laptops that my kids and I own, a quiet teen boy's life is turned upside down in an instant. \n\"Kenny\" is recorded doing something totally natural but embarrassing by the camera on his computer. He's then sent a message that he must provide his phone number to some unknown hackers or the video will be sent to all of his contacts. \nHe complies, but things just get worse. He's so scared about the video becoming public that he does whatever the hackers demand, including rob a bank. \nAgain, it seems like such a crazy premise, but it's completely conceivable. I can't look at that little camera at the top of my laptop without wondering if I'm being watched. Apparently, many people have this same paranoia, and put actual pieces of black tape over the camera. Maybe that little piece of tape is a metaphor for the boundaries we need to teach kids to set in this 24/7 social media world. \nWe want our kids to be tech savvy, since their future jobs may very well require fluency in social media and computers. But we want them to be smart with technology and make good choices. We warn them about not sharing inappropriate pictures, but considering the momentum today's technology, they've got to be aware of how easy it is to get sucked into this this almost-real world. \nTeresa M.

      "text": "1 \nWith Gilmore Girls returning to Netflix later this month, we’ll get a chance to see Lorelai, Rory, Luke, Emily and the whole Stars Hollow gang back in action once again. But some of the faces we probably won’t see are all the many actors who made guest appearances during Gilmore ‘s original run and then went on to become big stars. RELATED Gilmore Girls : Netflix Is Recreating Stars Hollow — and Inviting Fans to Move In \nAs we rewatched Gilmore Girls Seasons 1-7, we were reminded of the surprisingly long list of now-A-list TV stars that patronized Luke’s Diner and studied with Rory at Yale. So we’ve rounded them all up for you in one place. Launch Gallery \nKeep in mind: We’re not talking about series regulars like Melissa McCarthy or Jared Padalecki, who also became more famous post- Gilmore and do appear in the revival. And we’re also not talking about people who were already famous before they hit Stars Hollow, like Madeleine Albright or Norman Mailer. Just guest stars… who weren’t stars yet. \nClick on the gallery above to see 23 recognizable faces that were on Gilmore Girls before they were recognizable — then hit the comments to remind us of any we may have missed.

      "text": "\nBefore the Netflix series The Crown , most people just saw Prince Philip as the nice little old man who follows several paces behind Queen Elizabeth, but now, social media is all lit up with people saying that Matt Smith as Prince Philip is kind of a jerk. The Crown is taking a microscope to the early days of the reign of Queen Elizabeth, and introducing a whole new generation to the players behind palace walls.\nPrincess Margaret is also being seen in a different way on The Crown , as most people today think of William and Harry when people speak of “the heir and the spare,” but the original 20th century heir and spare were Princesses Elizabeth and Margaret, according to the Inquisitr . Season one of The Crown saw Princess Margaret’s hopes for a marriage to Peter Townsend dashed because he was divorced.\nMy squats paid off ????Prince Philip eyes up the ladies in impertinent scene from The Crown�� https://t.co/8RSQpye3XB via @DailyMailCeleb \n— Maeve Madden (@MaeveMadden) November 13, 2016 \n\nRefinery 29 says that Prince Philip is not that bad, as played by Matt Smith, before now, best known as one of the actors who played Dr. Who. For the first season of The Crown , Prince Philip seems to be shocked about what it really means to be married to the Queen of England, and is a bit fussy about the adjustment.\nRELATED REPORTS BY INQUISITR\nNew Series ‘The Crown’ Is The Most Expensive Yet By Netflix \nThings Viewers Of Netflix’s ‘The Crown’ Need To Know About Wallis… \nThings Viewers Of Netflix’s ‘The Crown ‘ Need To Know About Wallis… \nPrince Philip’s Custom Aston Martin Hits The Auction Block To Huge… \nPrince Philip sees himself as losing his identity, and by the end of season one, he is trying to wrestle it back from his wife, Queen Elizabeth II.

      "text": "Jovi Figueroa \nWhich Ubisoft favorite are we seeing soon on Netflix? Is it Watch Dogs, Assassin’s Creed, a Tom Clancy title, or maybe even Far Cry? \nIt’s just a few more weeks before the much-anticipated Assassin’s Creed movie premieres in US theaters. Assassin’s Creed has been one of the most successful franchises, not only of Ubisoft, but across the gaming industry, and it was only high time this legend get its own movie adaptation–although with the long list of disastrous game-to-movie adaptations, we are seriously worried for Assassin’s Creed. Digital Spy notes that Oscar-nominated Michael Fassbender is underlining the Assassin’s Creed cast and we’re very much excited what the movie can do for the franchise. Will the Assassin’s Creed movie succeed? [Image by Ubisoft] \nBut Ubisoft is not stopping with Assassin’s Creed. In fact, Ubisoft is determined to be even more aggressive with its various endeavors, following a recent news briefing that stated Ubisoft will stay independent for as long as it can. \nReuters reported that Ubisoft’s chairman and chief executive Yves Guillemot announced at the recent press briefing that despite pressures from one of its major shareholders Vivendi, Guillemot is trying his best to keep Ubisoft independent. In fact, the report notes that Ubisoft is gearing to acquire some $110 million-worth of assets in the mobile phone games sector and increase its workforce by 500 to 1,000 people in France over the next five years. \nIn addition to these aggressive moves to keep Ubisoft together, iDigital Times reports that Guillemot has confirmed he is in serious talks with Netflix over a series. While no other information has been released by Ubisoft regarding the upcoming Netflix project, it is highly possible that a Ubisoft title could be remade into a Netflix TV series. After the Assassin’s Creed movie, surely, Ubisoft is ready to take things to a whole new level by banking on Netflix. \nUbisoft first dabbled into movie and television producing back in 2011 when they created Ubisoft Motion Pictures, a division that focuses primarily on bringing Ubisoft gaming titles to the big and small screens. One of the first projects of the Ubisoft Motion Pictures was the animated TV series Rabbids Invasion , which started to air on Nickelodeon in 2013. Rabbids Invasion was based on the Raving Rabbids video game series produced by Ubisoft and is still in production, currently at its third season. \nAnother quite successful endeavor by Ubisoft in the film industry is The Division: Agent Origins, a short film this year based on Ubisoft’s open world third-person shooter Tom Clancy’s The Division. In fact, Cinema Blend was one of the many critics who looked favorably at The Division: Agent Origins despite the inevitable knack of video games to turn into horrible film adaptations. Maybe a followup to The Division: Agent Origins? [Image by Ubisoft] \nWith the success of Rabbids Invasion and The Division: Agent Origins, it’s highly certain that another one of Ubisoft’s titles will get the television treatment. We know that Splinter Cell , The Division , Far Cry , Ghost Recon , and Watch Dogs are rumored to be in development for a possible movie adaptations, Slash Film reports its easy to bring one of these titles to the television. \nIn fact, Assassin’s Creed could easily be continued into a TV series, too, if the movie does as good as fans hope it to be. Watch Dogs 2 is Ubisoft’s hottest title at the moment and if the franchise continues to be promising, a proper TV series based on Aiden Pearce is not too hard to imagine, as well. The Division’ s short film, too, left a lot of fans begging for more so a TV series might not be such a bad idea. \nIf you’re in San Francisco, come out to the Market St. @GameStop Launch Party! Get your hands on #WatchDogs2 Monday, 11.14 @ 6 – 9PM PST pic.twitter.com/KCXa1mJbac \n— Watch Dogs 2 (@watchdogsgame) November 13, 2016 \nMultimedia has been the trend nowadays and we’d love to see Ubisoft bring more of its franchises outside the gaming platforms and into the wider world of media. \n[Featured image by Ubisoft]",

      "text": "Ellen Scott for Metro.co.uk Saturday 12 Nov 2016 3:22 pm (Picture: Netflix) \nYou might not have noticed this, but Netflix is home to a lot of badass female characters. \nSeriously. Compare it to a lot of actually-on-the-TV networks and it’s impressive, in terms of the sheer number of women actually taking leading roles and the kind of characters actresses get to play with. \nIt’s lovely and very much needed. \nWe need characters like Jessica Jones, who’s tough but vulnerable. We need the diverse range of women starring in Orange Is The New Black. We asked women why they refuse to be called ‘feminist’ \nWe have serious soft spots for all of these characters, looking up to them and respecting them (yes, even though they’re not technically real). \nSo when Netflix told us they’d got some of our favourite female characters to write letters to their younger selves – and to women everywhere – we were on board. \nBring us some wisdom, please. Sophia Bursett, Orange Is The New Black (Picture: Netflix) Sophia's letter to her younger self: \nDear Marcus, \nYou are not alone. \nYou stand with anyone who’s ever questioned or doubted who they really were. \nAll the hurt can’t hurt nearly as much as denying how you truly feel inside. \nBecause, as long as you love yourself, you can never be alone. \nOh, and your legs look good! Work ’em! \nSincerely, ",

      "text": "Chelsea Handler was raw and real with her emotions in her post-election Netflix show on Wednesday. The comedian did not crack a single joke as she addressed her audience about the shocking upset of Hillary Clinton losing the presidential election to Donald Trump.\n\"The election's over and obviously the result is not what I was hoping for. Like a lot of people in this country, I'm sad, I'm disappointed and I'm confused,\" the host admitted. \"But if Hillary can make it through a concession speech, then I'm going to make it through a stupid television show, so I'm going to.\"\nWATCH: Late Night Hosts Address Election Results in Heartfelt Monologues\nAppropriately, Handler invited Senator Barbara Boxer, who has a long history in politics and whose daughter Nicole is married to Clinton's youngest brother, Tony Rodham, on the show to discuss her feelings.\n\"My heart's on the floor, and I think the first thing to do when something like this happens is admit that,\" Boxer said. \"A lot of us are on the ground right now. But I have lived a little bit longer than you and the audience here, and I have learned how painful politics can be. But that doesn't mean you run away. It means you pick yourself up, as the president said, and you fight even harder for our country, 'cause it's ours.\"\nBoxer then recalled her first election for the local office of County Supervisor in 1972, when she was met with sexism and lies and ultimately lost.\nMORE: Aaron Sorkin Wrote a Letter to His Daughter About Donald Trump's Win: Read It Now\n\"I was just a mess because I thought, 'Oh my God, they didn't like me,'\" she recalled. \"But remember, Hillary got more votes than Donald Trump. Do you understand what that means? And I take such solace in this, to know that more people said 'Stronger Together.'\"\nThe senator admitted that she hasn't spoken to Clinton since her defeat, getting emotional as she said, \"I like to write. I have too much to say. I want to think about it.\"\nHandler was also visibly upset, adding, \"As a woman it feels so sexist, and I guess the message I want to spread out to other women is exactly what you're saying – is not to give up.\"\nShe then openly cried, apologizing, \"Sorry, I hate f**king crying on camera – is not to give up because this is so important and it's easy to throw in the towel or we're going to leave. Or I'm going to move to Spain, because I want to move to Spain, I really, really want to move to Spain right now. But everyone in my office is like, 'You have a responsibility, you have a voice. You have to use it. You have to be here.'\"\nWATCH: Stephen Colbert Shares Emotional Reaction to Election Results, Cheers on Anti-Trump Protesters\nThough the pair traded a few barbs about the president-elect, they ultimately decided not to dwell on Trump's faults and to instead embrace the future.\n\"We just can't go back to the darkness. We have to go towards the light,\" Boxer said. \"Of course it's the flight syndrome – we fought, now we didn't win, so we're going to fly away. That's just what the people who gave this hateful message want us to do. And we're not going to do it. Forget it!\"\nFor more reactions to the election results, watch the clip below.\nRelated Articles\nJenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Chrissy Teigen Goes Makeup-Free Jennifer Garner Slays On The Red Carpet",

      "text": "But enough about politics. Has anyone else been watching The Crown ? For someone like me, who’ll watch pretty much anything that has to do with the royal family, it’s basically an early Christmas gift. Thanks Netflix!\nAnd, while I’d watch the thing even if it was dull as dirt and accompanied by an annoying screeching noise akin to fingernails on a chalkboard, I’m actually enjoying it much more than I thought I would after happening on a few negative reviews.\nTime , for example, describes the main narrative of the show (which follows Queen Elizabeth II, played masterfully by Claire Foy, in the early years of her reign) as a series of scenes in which the queen attends “meetings at which she either acquiesces to her advisors or puts off acquiescing until fifteen minutes later” and pronounces Elizabeth “a bore.” And The Independent summarizes the show as “men in rooms talking about what a woman should or shouldn't do.”\nIt’s not that everyone hates it, or anything. It’s received a number of glowing reviews from places like The New York Times and Vanity Fair , but this idea that the main character is rather dull seems to be held by many. But the reason I’m finding myself much more engrossed than I’d feared I might be, is that I think all the negative reviewers have totally missed the point.\nThough you might tune in for the impeccably appointed period rooms and the luxurious and historically accurate costumes (I certainly did), the show actually has something quite specific to say. Underneath the glitz and glamour we’ve come to expect from a Netflix drama of this kind, the show is clearly about the conflict between personal desires and responsibility.\nElizabeth’s grandmother, Queen Mary (played by Eileen Atkins), pretty much sums this up in Episode 2, Hyde Park Corner: “I have seen three great monarchies brought down through their failure to separate personal indulgences from duty . . . The fact is: the crown must win.”\nI don’t know about you, but I think the old lady’s got a point. Substitute “the crown” for “duty given by God” (as the monarchy was/is believed to be) and I think the show has something relevant and worthwhile to say.\nSo, yes, Elizabeth does spend a lot of time acting like she’s going to defy the government (helmed by an aging Winston Churchill, played expertly by John Lithgow) and then being convinced not to. But there’s a reason for that.\nJohn Lithgow as Winston Churchill\nImage: YouTube Screenshot\nWhen, for example, her husband, Philip, played by Doctor Who’s Matt Smith, convinces her that they shouldn’t move to Buckingham Palace (the traditional home of the monarch) but stay in their family home, Elizabeth is initially on board. She loves their home and finds Buckingham Palace impersonal and vast. Plus, she wants to appease her husband who is trying to assert himself as head of the household even as his wife is becoming queen. But, in the face of Churchill’s strong disapproval, she backs down and moves everyone to the palace.\nSure, you could call her a pushover. Our American sensibilities don’t take well to being told we must follow tradition. And we worry about her, also, because she’s a woman being told what to do by men. But she isn’t a pushover at all. She’s choosing between what she wants and what’s best for the crown. And, as Granny says, the crown must win.\nWhy? Because people are broken and petty and selfish and mean. They give in to their emotions because they think they mean something. They favor themselves and the ones they love and believe themselves righteous because that feels good to them. It’s only when they step outside of all of those things, put them to the side and examine the issue for its own sake, that they can do their duty .\nhttps://pjmedia.com/lifestyle/2016/11/13/netflixs-the-crown-reminds-us-that-duty-must-win-over-personal-desires/\nprevious Page 1 of 2 ",

      "text": "Gilmore Girls Countdown Netflix Revival More With Gilmore Girls returning to Netflix later this month, we’ll get a chance to see Lorelai, Rory, Luke, Emily and the whole Stars Hollow gang back in action once again. But some of the faces we probably won’t see are all the many actors who made guest appearances during Gilmore ‘s original run and then went on to become big stars.\nRELATED Gilmore Girls : Netflix Is Recreating Stars Hollow — and Inviting Fans to Move In\nAs we rewatched Gilmore Girls Seasons 1-7, we were reminded of the surprisingly long list of now-A-list TV stars that patronized Luke’s Diner and studied with Rory at Yale. So we’ve rounded them all up for you in one place.\nKeep in mind: We’re not talking about series regulars like Melissa McCarthy or Jared Padalecki, who also became more famous post- Gilmore and do appear in the revival. And we’re also not talking about people who were already famous before they hit Stars Hollow, like Madeleine Albright or Norman Mailer. Just guest stars… who weren’t stars yet.\nClick on the gallery above to see 23 recognizable faces that were on Gilmore Girls before they were recognizable — then hit the comments to remind us of any we may have missed. (Taylor will address any discrepancies at the next town meeting, time permitting.)\nLaunch Gallery: 'Gilmore Girls': Guest Stars Who Became Famous\nRelated stories\nGilmore Girls: Scott Patterson Reveals Why Final 4 Words 'Perturbed' Him\nGilmore Girls: Netflix Is Recreating Stars Hollow -- and Inviting Fans to Move In\nGilmore Girls EPs Tease Revival's First Scene, Drop Final 4 Words Hint\nGet more from TVLine : Follow us on Twitter , Facebook , Newsletter",

      "text": "Netflix's The Crown is capturing hearts.\nThe extravagant period drama charts the life of a young Queen Elizabeth II ( Claire Foy ), from her royal wedding to Prince Philip ( Matt Smith ) in 1947 to her reign as leader of England in the present day -- and people can't get enough!\nIn the first episode, The Crown kicks off with Elizabeth's nuptials to Philip, with whom she began corresponding when she was just 13 years old and he was 18. Though she married Philipas a young heir to the throne, less than five years later, Elizabeth would become queen and the couple's lives would change forever.\nRELATED: Watch the Trailer for 'The Crown,' Netflix's Ambitious New Series\n\"The thing that I loved the most about it was the fact that they are genuinely trying to have a relationship and a marriage, and at every turn, they're thwarted,\" Foy, 32, told ET of their early years as a married couple. \"It really is a bit of a battleground.\"\nBut The Crown is all about keeping things sexy, too. In the show, Philip -- played by Doctor Who 's Smith -- sleeps in the nude.\n\"He was not a man who would want to be emasculated,\" Foy said.\n\"No, he wasn't,\" Smith, 34, added, saying that Philip's \"an alpha.\"\nRELATED: John Lithgow on the 'Challenges' of Transforming Into Churchill on The Crown'\nWhen the clothes are on, the fashion is exquisite. Not only were replicas of the queen's gowns created to near-perfect detail, elaborate costumes for more than 7,000 extras were also custom-made.\nThough the 10-episode first season premiered on Netflix earlier this month, a second season has already been ordered. There are plans for 60 episodes over six seasons in total, with each chronicling a different decade of Queen Elizabeth's life.\nProduction didn't spare a penny when it came to the jewels. The crown Foy wears in the series \"is heavy,\" she admitted, sharing a secret behind how they made it work. \"It didn't really fit, so it was a bit wibbity-wobbity.\"\n\"You really do have to hold yourself properly and I did have to practice with it quite a lot,\" Foy said.\nRELATED: Move Over Prince George, There's a New Royal Cutie in Town\nFor the actors, they're hoping that the royal family will be receptive to their show.\n\"I hope they invite us around for dinner,\" Smith said, with Foy echoing his sentiments: \"That would be nice, wouldn't it?\"\nEven so, they were realistic about the chances of the real royals tuning in.\n\"They probably won't even watch -- it is the truth,\" Smith said, jokingly adding, \"If it was me, I would be intrigued to see it because I'm vain and I want to see someone play me.\"\n\"They've been there and done that and want to probably get an early night,\" Foy agreed.\n\"Yeah, feed the corgis!\" Smith adorably added.\nThe Crown is streaming now on Netflix.\nRELATED: Prince George Poses for the Most Adorable Royal Family Portrait\nRelated Articles\nJenna Dewan Tatum Shows Off Toned Abs Chrissy Teigen Goes Makeup-Free Jennifer Garner Slays On The Red Carpet",

      "text": "Courtesy of Netflix November 13, 2016 | 07:11PM PT \nFollowing a screening of her documentary “ 13th ” Sunday night, director Ava DuVernay addressed the election of Donald Trump and the implications of his imminent presidency as it pertains to the subject matter of her film, which details the prison industrial complex in America. \n“He’s addressed his views about it. He’s addressed a lack of empathy for imprisoned and incarcerated people,” DuVernay said, in a post-screening Q&A moderated by Oprah Winfrey at the Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles. “He’s talked about the industry around it. He’s ‘very good at business,’ and he feels that it’s a business. Stocks for the private prison industry rose by over 50 percent the day after his election. So folks are betting on the fact that he will not just continue but increase that part of the business.” Related Why Not a Documentary for Best Picture? \nIn earlier remarks, Winfrey called the film “a wake-up call” and “the ultimate in storytelling and activism … You come away from this film and you feel differently about what justice and injustice looks like.” \nDuVernay said she expects that the bleak status quo outlined in “13th” will only continue or worsen under Trump, “unless we demand something different.” \nYou can view two clips from the Q&A below.

      "text": "We've got Netflix, iflix, Viu and now, Malaysians are given yet another option for their preferred online streaming service to satisfy craving for movies, dramas and entertainment. Called Dimsum, the country's latest video-on-demand (VOD) service launched by Star Media Group's subsidiary Star Online earlier last week, it claims to \"strives to serve the best Asian content\" to its audience.\nThe name \" Dimsum \" is derived from the famous Chinese cuisine dim sum and loosely translates to English to literally mean a “selection of the heart.” In a statement to A+M, Star Media Group said Dimsum's content are sourced from all over the region, offering subscriptional video-on-demand (SVOD) on its Dimsum app and Dimsum.my.\nDatuk Seri Wong Chun Wai (pictured: first from right), Star Media Group's group managing director and chief executive officer added that its subscribers will pay RM15 a month, for up to five concurrent devices. Wong added that this latest investment on the VOD market is part of the group’s digital transformation plan.\nOn its expansion plan to other regions or countries, he shared with A+M that for now the plan is to \"focus on developing the Malaysian market\" with target audience primarily living in Klang Valley.\nLike iflix, Dimsum users will also be able to choose their preferred subtitles available in different languages and download content for offline viewing with \"up to ten videos at a time and watch offline for up to 14 days.\"\nDimsum's content will mostly feature drama series from Taiwan, Japan, China, Thailand, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore and Malaysia. Examples of these content include, the Malaysian premieres of \"Chinese Paladin 5\" starring Elvis Han and Joe Cheng; Taiwanese idol drama “Love by Design”; Korean drama “Riders : Catch Tomorrow”; director’s special version of “Nirvana on Fire”; popular online drama “The Devil Game” and “Lost? Me\" and Thailand's drama “Lovey Dovey.”\nThe media company which also publishes The Star newspaper, said there is also daily news on dimsum such as 988 Topline News, Pop News, LENSA and CUPPA NEWS from Star TV.\nIt will also bring in the biggest budget Chinese drama in the history, “Tribes & Empires: Storm of Prophecy” which will premiere exclusively on dimsum in Malaysia in the first quarter of 2017, says Star Media Group.\nOther highlights include variety and entertainment shows such as the extremely hilarious “Crazy Stone”, popular singing reality show “I Am a Singer” and Korean music show “I Can See Your Voice.”",

      "text": "How Netflix, Inc. Gained 27% in October newsfeedback@fool.com (Anders Bylund) Image source: Netflix. What happened \nShares of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) rose 26.7% in October, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence . The boost came from a solid third-quarter report. So what \nIn the third quarter, Netflix added 3.6 million net new subscribers -- 55% above management's own guidance targets. Sales increased 32% year over year and GAAP earnings jumped 75% higher, setting the company on a clear path toward a promised slate of \"substantial profits\" in 2017. \nLooking ahead, the fourth quarter should see 5.2 million new subscribers on a global level. That would result in a total of 91.9 million global members, a 23% year-over-year increase paired with 40% higher revenues. NFLX data by YCharts Now what \nWith this report, Netflix showed solid evidence that modest price increases are not scaring away unreasonable amounts of service members. Most of the company's worldwide markets have only been aboard since January and won't run a profit for several years, but there's no need to panic about that. CEO Reed Hastings has a detailed long-term plan in mind, and the early market-building phase is now over (except for finding a pathway into China, of course). \nNetflix remains the largest holding in my personal investment portfolio and is likely to stay that way for years to come. I can't wait to see the market reaction when Hastings finally outlines the size of his long-expected 2017 profits -- and that's still just the start of a global entertainment empire in the making. \nA secret billion-dollar stock opportunity \nThe world's biggest tech company forgot to show you something, but a few Wall Street analysts and the Fool didn't miss a beat: There's a small company that's powering their brand-new gadgets and the coming revolution in technology. And we think its stock price has nearly unlimited room to run for early in-the-know investors! To be one of them, just click here . \nAnders Bylund owns shares of Netflix.

      "text": "By Laura Hedli Nov 14, 2016 What to expect from the highly-anticipated Netflix reboot and the Tony-winning talent involved in an on screen musical. \nConsider it a day-after-Thanksgiving treat: Sutton Foster and Christian Borle step-ball-changing in pilgrim costumes to new, original Jeanine Tesori tunes. And you won’t need a ticket to see this, just a Netflix subscription. The talents of these musical theatre giants will be featured on Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life . \nInvited to catch a glimpse of the making of a handful of musical numbers for the beloved television series reboot, Playbill.com spent a day on the Warner Bros. backlot in Burbank, CA. \nWithin five minutes of arriving via golf cart to Stars Hollow, the fictional Connecticut hamlet at the heart of Gilmore Girls, I met her, creator and executive producer Amy Sherman-Palladino. Like many women of a certain age, I grew up on a healthy diet of Gilmore, adoring the rapid-fire, whip-smart dialogue on a show about a mother (Lorelai) and daughter (Rory) only 16 years apart and best friends. Gilmore Girls first aired on the WB in 2000, and Netflix made bingeing easy when the seven-season series became available for streaming in 2014. \nOn November 25, audiences will get to enjoy four new episodes. Each 90-minute installment encapsulates a season, beginning with Winter, followed by Spring, Summer, and Fall, (a nod to Carole King given that “Where You Lead” is the show’s theme song). \nOn the March day I visited the set, Sherman-Palladino shared her delight at working on the Netflix revivalnearly 10 years after the series finale aired. Even Foster, who previously starred in Sherman-Palladino’s Bunheads on ABC Family, buzzed with excitement. \n“There’s something about the generations, the idea of a mom, her daughter, and the mom’s mother,” said Foster, explaining why she was drawn to Gilmore Girls . “There’s nothing else that exists on television that’s like it. Amy Sherman-Palladino has such a voice, and her writing has such a voice.” \nSherman-Palladino delivered on her promise to write something for Foster in the reboot. Foster and Borle star in The History of Stars Hollow: A Musical , which is excerpted in the Summer episode. The musical-within-the-show is written, directed, and produced by quirky Town Selectman Taylor Doose. Foster and Borle play community theatre performers trying hard to impress. The two discovered Gilmore Girls together and are both self-proclaimed huge fans. \nStaging an original musical seems entirely plausible, especially for a town that has its own troubadour. \nTesori wrote the music to four original songs, including “Working on Building Stars Hollow” and “Love Revolution,” while Sherman-Palladino and her husband and executive producer Dan Palladino wrote the lyrics. Marguerite Derricks ( Bunheads , Sister Act ) choreographed the musical numbers and gave the actors room to improvise. They tried falling off stools, throwing bottles, a round of patty-cake—anything goes, and the Tony winners drew upon their familiarity with the show. \n“We came up with some funny stuff, within the world of Stars Hollow,” said Borle. “We are performing musical theatre style, definitely, in this very small space that is being filmed.” \nAt the top of the scene, Taylor (played by Michael Winters) tries his material on an audience of townsfolk. There are some big names in the first two rows: musical legend King, who returns as music store owner Sophie, Sally Struthers, who plays Lorelai’s neighbor Babette, and Lauren Graham, A.K.A. Lorelai Gilmore. \nBorle plays Carl. Foster plays Violet. (Coincidental naming? I think not since Sherman-Palladino was producer on the Foster-starring Broadway show.) Based on the takes I saw, here’s a sampling of the lyrics for the song “Love Revolution”: \nVIOLET: You are me in pants.CARL: You are me in a dress. / I tried it on.VIOLET: It fits a bit askance. \nCHORUS (both): “It’s a love, love, love revolution in a revolutionary time!” \n(For the record, I can still hum Tesori’s silly-yet-fittingly-prim chorus today, more than six months later.) \nFoster felt the over-the-topness of it all. “The giggles are real, they’re very real,” she said between takes. (I heard this via headset while watching the monitors.) Later, Foster shared that her character is indeed a struggling actor. “I think coming to Stars Hollow to be part of the musical is a big get for her, but she definitely has some resentment that she hasn’t made it further,” she said. \nFoster and Borle’s roles in the reboot are teased with a split-second coupé at the end of the Netflix trailer . (Minute 2:04. Seriously, don’t blink.) The trailer broadly suggests that our Gilmore girls are adrift, each in her own way. The death of husband-father-grandfather Richard Gilmore looms large. (Ed Herrmann who played Richard passed away in 2014.) \nEmily is newly widowed. Lorelai is famously second-guessing. And Rory is untethered but unsatisfied. That being said, the banter, zaniness, and pop culture references that made this show such a joy remain front and center in the revival. And have your Oxford English Dictionary at the ready when you watch, because these ladies still bring their A-game when it comes to vocabulary. “Encomiums” – I heard word that on set. Coffee on me if you know what it means without looking it up. \nIn the Season 3’s episode “Take the Deviled Eggs,” Rory proclaims: “I never want to leave this town,” and I knew just what she meant. At one point, costume designer Brenda Maben approached me and asked if she could take a photo of my day-glo orange and leopard print shoes for inspiration. Jimmy Choo-loving Lorelai Gilmore would have been proud—and so was I. \nBut proudest of all are Sherman-Palladino and Palladino, who now honor their vision for ending the show. Happily, that vision included musical theatre and a new family of talent. In fact, Foster was the one to suggest that Borle be cast. “It was one of the nicest things anyone has ever done for me,” Borle said. “It was such a gift.” RELATED:",

      "title": "Stranger Things’ Millie Bobby Brown Wants To Be In Star Wars And The Walking Dead",
      "text": "\nWhen Stranger Things arrived on Netflix this past summer, it took everyone by storm . With a second season now in production and anticipation high for what’s one of television’s best new shows, it’s safe to say that the entire cast will begin to see a rise in popularity.\nOne actress who’s seen a significant bump thanks to her work on the series is Millie Bobby Brown, whose character Eleven was a clear fan favorite throughout the first season. Though she’s yet to lock down any further roles in either film or television, she’s certainly got her eye on some pretty exciting projects.\nMORE NEWS FROM THE WEB \n\nSpeaking at a panel during the Rhode Island Comic Con, Brown mentioned that she’d love to join both The Walking Dead and a future Star Wars film. While discussing the former, she mentioned that she wants to be a part of it so badly that she’d even play a zombie:\n“There’s this one show I just want to be on so badly, I’ve tried everything to get on The Walking Dead. I don’t even care if I’m a zombie! And I do know that…Negan is here today.”\nIn regards to the galaxy far, far away, Brown said that she’d like to play a younger version of Princess Leia. Disney doesn’t currently have any plans to explore the character’s life before A New Hope , but given that they’re making a Han Solo prequel, it’s entirely possible that a young Leia will show up at some point as well. And if she does, the studio would be wise to consider the Stranger Things actress.\nCircling back to the Netflix series, we already know that Brown is set to return , and with a whole slew of new cast members coming on board, not to mention chatter of a third season already heating up , it’s safe to say that we’ll be getting a whole lot more of Eleven in the years to come – and we’re perfectly alright with that.\n",

      "title": "‘The Crown’ Season 2 Release Date: Netflix Show Cast Members Confirm Second Season",
      "text": "Josh Moorcroft \nThe Crown has quickly become another runaway hit for streaming provider Netflix. With that in mind, it’s safe to assume that Netflix would be keen to produce a second season of the royal drama. That second season of The Crown has now been confirmed by a number of the show’s cast members, but when will it be released and which cast members will return? In this article, we’ll take a look at everything we know so far about Season 2 of Netflix’s hit royal drama, The Crown . \nWill there be a second season of The Crown ? \nAccording to the Radio Times , quickly following the success of the series’ first season, Matt Smith, who plays Prince Phillip and Claire Foy, who plays a young Queen Elizabeth II, both confirmed that they’d be returning for a second season . That’s not just the presumption of the cast either, with the show’s producers confirming that Netflix has already ordered a second season. In fact, to further cement the deal, both Smith and Foy have confirmed that they’ve already begun rehearsals for The Crown Season 2. \nThat being said, the show’s main stars were keen to stress that they won’t play their parts in the show forever. However, that’s no surprise considering The Crown plans to document the life of Queen Elizabeth II over the course of a number of decades, meaning that young actors like Smith and Foy won’t always be a perfect fit. The Crown Season 2: Renewal Status and Netflix Release Date https://t.co/ebJUrcm2CN pic.twitter.com/iw0w4uNVQp \n— Whats On Netflix (@whatonnetflix) November 4, 2016 \nHow long will The Crown Season 2 be? \nNetflix is yet to officially confirm how many episodes The Crown Season 2 will be comprised of, with the streaming provider likely to be discussing the matter with writer Peter Morgan. However, producer Andrew Eaton has said that he expects another ten episode run out of the show’s second season. That would make sense considering Netflix is typically pretty consistent when it comes to the length of its original shows on a season to season basis, however, an exception could be made if needed for The Crown . <noscript><iframe width=\"500\" height=\"281\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/IFGe1CX_4go?feature=oembed\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></noscript> \nRELATED STORIES ON INQUISITR:",

      "text": "Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events Release Date A Series Of Unfortunate Events Premiere Date \nMark your calendars! Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events will first premiere on January 13, 2017. Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events Trailer \nThe first official teaser trailer for Netflix's #ASOUE has finally dropped, and it features Patrick Wharburton as Lemony Snicket, roaming around an abandoned stage, lamenting the fact that Netflix has agreed to take on this project at all. \nWatch it right here: \nBut is that really the first trailer for the series? This basically perfect \"fan-made\" trailer landed on YouTube a little while ago, posted by user Eleanora Poe (that's the name of the editor of the Daily Punctilio). While sources like Variety and Daniel Handler insist it isn't legit, knowing the Snicket style of stirring up publicity and then trying to dodge it (seriously, who has an Unauthorized Autobiography?), this could all just be part of the scheme. \nEither way, the trailer is awesome, and features the song \"Missed Me\" by the Dresden Dolls. \nCheck it out now: — Daniel Handler (@DanielHandler) July 6, 2015 Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events Cast \nNeil Patrick Harris will play the ghastly guardian Count Olaf... Neil Patrick Harris as Count Olaf \n...with Patrick Warburton as the woebegone writer and narrator, Lemony Snicket... Patrick Warburton as Lemony Snicket \n...

Jack Forrester as Albert Poe \nIt's worth mentioning that there is a RUMOR that the unbelievably talented Bernadette Peters will grace the cast as grammar fanatic Aunt Josephine. IMDB says so, but unfortunately, nobody else does. Contrary to what the Volunteers Fighting Disease may say, picturing something does not make it so. But STILL. Meryl Streep's Aunt J was by far the strongest part of the 2004 ASOUE movie, so they're going to have to get someone pretty damn special to follow up that performance. Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events Characters \nAccording to IMDB, the following characters will all make an appearance in Netflix's A Series Of Unfortunate Events . Of course, it's not clear whether or not this will be the complete character list for the first season. It's possible that more characters will be added later. Count Olaf ",

      "text": "'Luke Cage' Just Broke Netflix — And Then Responded Perfectly Netflix Still Reigns Supreme When It Comes To 'Certified Fresh' Films \nIs there anything more frustrating then having friends over to watch a movie only to struggle to choose a film, scrolling up and down the bottom of Netflix's barrel? Although it may seem like there's nothing to watch on Netflix, despite having approximately 6,949 films available, the streaming giant is still leading the way when it comes to quantity. \nMost people turn to IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes to figure out whether the movies they might watch are worthwhile, and if a movie or a show earns huge approval from Rotten Tomatoes (over 75%), it gets a 'Certified Fresh' endorsement. Films and shows with that seal of guaranteed excellence are on the rise on Netflix but Amazon Prime is slowly gaining ground — as you can see in the chart below: via Streaming Observer Breaking Down The Stats \nAmazon Prime is sneaking up on the red giant with just 121 less 'Certified Fresh' titles, but it also boasts a movie library four times as big as Netflix's. HBO Now on the other hand has a long way to go before it can compete with the frontrunner's catalogue of quality flicks with roughly one seventh of the 'Fresh' films available. via StreamingObserver.com \nNetflix should refrain from tooting their own horns just yet though, as further research reveals that out of the thousands of 'Fresh' films, Netflix still only hosts a mere 15%. However, that's still 5% more than Amazon Prime and 13% more than the newcomer, HBO Now. When it comes to movie catalogues, there is a clear winner but these streaming giants are also battling it out in the realm of original content, where the power-struggle is a bit more balanced. The 'Original Content' War Is Fierce \n2016 may not have been a great year for Earth but it certainly was a great year for Netflix. Shows like Stranger Things , #LukeCage , House of Cards and the return of The Gilmore Girls dominate critics 'best of' lists and Award shows. It's Netflix's original content that fuel the unstoppable locomotive. The company have bet big and taken risks on shows like #StrangerThings and #JessicaJones , but those risks have paid off big and earned them the capital to attract big names like Kevin Spacey to their roster. \nCheck out how Netflix produced the amazing VFX on Stranger Things : \nHBO launched its streaming service, HBO Now, in 2014 to try and spoil Netflix's party. The service not only offers an enormous amount of A-list and B-list films but also access to HBO's entire catalogue of groundbreaking shows such as The Sopranos , The Wire , #GameofThrones and #Westworld , to name a few. And Amazon have fought back with shows like Transparent and big projects for 2017 including a David O. Russell/ Robert De Niro collaboration that will be the most expensive TV show ever made . \nCheck out the trailer for HBO's astounding Westworld : The Future Of Streaming Wars \nThe revolution will not be televised — because it will most likely be available on a streaming service instead. It seems that more networks may launch streaming services in the near future, with CBS teaming up with YouTube and NBC universal launching their Reality TV streaming service next year. After looking down on Netflix for so long, it looks as though the big broadcasters are rushing to join the streaming world, but they will have a lot of catching up to do to challenge the red giant. \nWhat do you think Netflix has to do in order to stay ahead of the game?

Netflix documentary 'The Ivory Game' infiltrates poaching system McKenna Park, Deseret News   7:02 AM CDT 0 shares × The Ivory Game (2016) (Netflix) \n\"THE IVORY GAME\" — 3 1/2 stars — directed by Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson, executive producer Leonardo DiCaprio; not rated; Netflix \nA dank room comes into view with several people milling about. Spread throughout the entire floor and piled up against the walls are tons upon tons of dirty, fresh elephant tusks. People in a line pass down an individual tusk until it reaches the last person, who carefully stacks it on top of a high pile. \n\"We don't have enough shelf space for all this ivory,\" says the program manager. \nThis is just one of many impactful scenes included in Netflix's new original documentary, \"The Ivory Game,\" that released Friday. \n“The Ivory Game” is not the typical activist documentary using feeble attempts of stirring emotion to sway the audience toward the cause. Rather, the film has a solid foundation of evidence and substantial exploration of the ivory situation to display it as a real crisis. It gives voice to the activists, conservationists and investigative journalists who have dedicated their lives to protecting elephants against poachers. \nDirectors Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson jump back and forth between the elephant poaching in Africa and the ivory black market in China. Filming in Africa concentrates on both wild elephants and greedy poachers. China's side of the story gives insight into a culture where ivory is a status symbol of the wealthy. It also shows how the illegal system of obtaining ivory is safeguarded by shops that legally and publicly sell it. \nAs an executive producer of \"The Ivory Game,\" Leonardo DiCaprio adds to his recent efforts to be a voice for environmentalism. \n“Having people like Jane Goodall and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are very passionate, helps keep us going,\" Davidson said in an interview with \" Entertainment Tonight ,\" \"because this in particular — more than anything that either of us have worked on before — was the most difficult film we’ve ever done.” \nFilming in each continent presents dangerous situations. Between undercover infiltrations with heads of the black market and hunting down poachers responsible for the deaths of thousands of elephants, there is no doubt that filming \"The Ivory Game\" was a risky undertaking. \nThe filmmakers display a vast range of cinematography, including aerial shots over plains and big cities, high-definition close-ups of elephants, undercover cameras infiltrating the black market and night-vision shots chasing down poachers. \nWhile scenes were artfully shot, perhaps even more impactful is the content they were able to capture within the frame. Viewers see Chinese stores piled full of artfully crafted ivory, recently poached elephant carcasses with their tusks ripped away and top tradesmen explaining their heartless ivory sales systems. \nRhinos, however, did not get a share in the documentary, even though they are hunted for their horns and consequently also severely affected by the ivory crisis. Perhaps the filmmakers felt they had enough ground to cover by focusing only on elephants; the documentary surely never felt stretched thin for content. Yet it does fail to mention how the alarmingly quick decline in elephant population is affecting Africa’s ecosystem. The shown effects of poaching end at elephant carcasses. \nAs the number of elephants goes down, the price of ivory climbs higher and higher. For this reason, “traders in ivory actually want the extinction of elephants,” says Craig Millar, a conservationist quoted in the film. Alarmingly, even though the Chinese and U.S. governments have begun working to end the ivory trade, poachers kill an elephant every 15 minutes, according to the documentary. \nThis is not a documentary that, once finished, is likely to have viewers thinking to themselves \"that was nice,\" and then going on with their lives. \"The Ivory Game\" and its message stick. It is impactful and will make viewers seriously consider the simple concluding invitation to take action by visiting theivorygame.com . \n\"The Ivory Game\" is not rated but includes disturbing images of animal cruelty and brief strong language; running time: 112 minutes.

      "text": "Phil Simon | November 14, 2016 5 Tweet \nThere are many reasons organizations like Netflix and Amazon can glean fascinating insights into consumer behavior: their data is vast and eerily accurate. That is, employees don't have to spend a great deal of time scrubbing data for location, past purchases, preferences and the like. Put differently, these companies need not speculate on who their customers are, merely what they want. \nBig difference. \nLamentably, that's not the case for the vast majority of organizations today. Cleansing and verifying data for even basic reporting – never mind sophisticated analytics – often hamstrings their efforts. Analytics \" projects \" with ambitious charters and big budgets wind up barely offering anything remotely resembling value. Another one bites the dust. \nWith respect to data preparation, organizations are loathe to truly empower nontechnical employees for many reasons, some of which are legitimate. (Can anyone say SOX ?) Along these lines, David Loshin writes about conventional approaches to data preparation. In his words: The data warehouse approach balances two key goals: organized data inclusion (a large amount of data is integrated into a single data platform), and objective presentation (data is managed in an abstract data model specifically suited for querying and reporting). \nLet me paraphrase. By systematizing data preparation, organizations arguably do two things. First, they minimize the risk of the rogue employee going off the reservation. Second and on a related note, they curtail the risk of uninformed – if well-intentioned – employees making mistakes. In my consulting career, I've seen a few employees run massive purge programs in production only to find out that those programs do indeed work. Ending the blame game \nTo be fair, these risks aren't insignificant – but let's not overlook the costs of cementing IT's central involvement in all data preparation efforts. For one, it reinforces the toxic IT-business divide . Beyond that, it frustrates employees and costs the organization invaluable time to capitalize on time-sensitive promotions, opportunities and specials. \nEmployees with unfettered and direct access to sensitive production data? Insane, right? Perhaps, but make no mistake: This type of access promotes individual employee responsibility. That is, no longer can employees use IT as the organization's whipping boy when data issues manifest themselves. And, all else being equal, better data means better and more meaningful analytics . Simon says: Embrace self-service. \nDon't treat data self-service as a binary: all or nothing. Rather, why not experiment with limited self-service over the course of several months? Why not try an agile approach? Maybe the concerns mentioned here are well founded, not overblown. Maybe an organization's culture mitigates these risks. Feedback",

      "text": "  \n(Facebook/Bloodline TV) Promotional image for \"Bloodline\" \nNetflix doesn't release their numbers, so it's very hard to figure out the real reason as to why the streaming giant decided to cancel \"Bloodline\" after only three seasons with the network. \nThe series was initially renewed for a third season back in July, but come September, Netflix revealed that the upcoming season 3 for \"Bloodline\" will be the last for the drama. There has been speculation that one of the main reasons why Netflix cancelled the series was because Florida, the state where the series is produced, has cut their incentives program, making it more expensive to make the series. \nIn an interview with Variety, \"Bloodline\" executive producer Daniel Zelman revealed that the initial plans for the series was that it will have around six seasons, so it is not known how the third season of \"Bloodline\" would end to neatly tie all loose ends. \nSo far, \"Bloodline\" producers Zelman, Todd A. Kessler, and Glenn Kessler have kept mum on what can be expected of the third season, although fans are expecting that more sinister family secrets will be unveiled. Advertisement \nNot everything is bad news for the series, however, as Ben Mendelsohn was recently given a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Actor in a Drama Series for his role as Danny Rayburn in \"Bloodline\" after being nominated for the award twice. This is the first Emmy Award for Mendelsohn. \nHis co-star, Kyle Chandler, was also nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama series, but was not able to take home the prize. Chandler has been nominated for the Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series five times, and won once for his portrayal of Eric Taylor in Friday Night Lights in 2011. \n\"Bloodline\" is the third of Netflix's original series which has been cancelled by the streaming giant. \nThere is still no official premiere date for \"Bloodline\" season 3, but it is expected to be released around mid-2017.

      "text": "Tweet \nIt’s the middle of November, and Australia welcomes 13 new Netflix titles to its viewers after the mass of 83 last week! Out of the 13 we have selected 3 that stand out to us and that you might want to check out, now they are streaming. \nOur first pick is the new TV series ‘Frequency’ which follows a police detective who, after reminiscing about her deceased father, discovers she can communicate to her father in 1996 using his old HAM radio. Her life then changes drastically. Just watching the trailer gave me chills. The show has received high ratings, so all the more reason to give it a go. \nThe original A-Team TV show was remade in 2010, it stared Liam Neeson, Bradley Cooper, Sharlto Copley and Quinton ‘Rampage’ Jackson as the iconic team that everyone knows. If you enjoy gravity defying action movies like ‘The Expendables’ you will enjoy this movie. The four members are framed and sent to separate prisons, where they escape with the help of a CIA ‘spook’ to redeem themselves while being pursued. \nOur final pick is the fresh new Netflix original movie ‘The True Memoirs of an International Assassin’ starring the lovable Kevin James as a budding novel writer. His Spy novel is published as a non-fiction and after it hits success he is abducted by criminals who think he is the real thing. This action, Comedy resembles a lot of Adam Sandler type movies. So if you are a fan of him, we think that you should definitely give this one a go. \nRead on for the full list of all 13 new releases: 11 New Movies Streaming to Netflix Australia \nThe A-Team (2010)",

Spread throughout the entire floor and piled up against the walls are tons upon tons of dirty, fresh elephant tusks. People in a line pass down an individual tusk until it reaches the last person, who carefully stacks it on top of a high pile.\"We don't have enough shelf space for all this ivory,\" says the program manager.This is just one of many impactful scenes included in Netflix's new original documentary, \"The Ivory Game,\" that released Friday.“The Ivory Game” is not the typical activist documentary using feeble attempts of stirring emotion to sway the audience toward the cause. Rather, the film has a solid foundation of evidence and substantial exploration of the ivory situation to display it as a real crisis. It gives voice to the activists, conservationists and investigative journalists who have dedicated their lives to protecting elephants against poachers.Directors Richard Ladkani and Kief Davidson jump back and forth between the elephant poaching in Africa and the ivory black market in China. Filming in Africa concentrates on both wild elephants and greedy poachers. China's side of the story gives insight into a culture where ivory is a status symbol of the wealthy. It also shows how the illegal system of obtaining ivory is safeguarded by shops that legally and publicly sell it.As an executive producer of \"The Ivory Game,\" Leonardo DiCaprio adds to his recent efforts to be a voice for environmentalism.“Having people like Jane Goodall and Leonardo DiCaprio, who are very passionate, helps keep us going,\" Davidson said in an interview with \" Entertainment Tonight ,\" \"because this in particular — more than anything that either of us have worked on before — was the most difficult film we’ve ever done.”Filming in each continent presents dangerous situations. Between undercover infiltrations with heads of the black market and hunting down poachers responsible for the deaths of thousands of elephants, there is no doubt that filming \"The Ivory Game\" was a risky undertaking.The filmmakers display a vast range of cinematography, including aerial shots over plains and big cities, high-definition close-ups of elephants, undercover cameras infiltrating the black market and night-vision shots chasing down poachers.While scenes were artfully shot, perhaps even more impactful is the content they were able to capture within the frame. Viewers see Chinese stores piled full of artfully crafted ivory, recently poached elephant carcasses with their tusks ripped away and top tradesmen explaining their heartless ivory sales systems.Rhinos, however, did not get a share in the documentary, even though they are hunted for their horns and consequently also severely affected by the ivory crisis. Perhaps the filmmakers felt they had enough ground to cover by focusing only on elephants; the documentary surely never felt stretched thin for content. Yet it does fail to mention how the alarmingly quick decline in elephant population is affecting Africa’s ecosystem. The shown effects of poaching end at elephant carcasses.As the number of elephants goes down, the price of ivory climbs higher and higher. For this reason, “traders in ivory actually want the extinction of elephants,” says Craig Millar, a conservationist quoted in the film. Alarmingly, even though the Chinese and U.S. governments have begun working to end the ivory trade, poachers kill an elephant every 15 minutes, according to the documentary.This is not a documentary that, once finished, is likely to have viewers thinking to themselves \"that was nice,\" and then going on with their lives. \"The Ivory Game\" and its message stick. It is impactful and will make viewers seriously consider the simple concluding invitation to take action by visiting theivorygame.com . \"The Ivory Game\" is not rated but includes disturbing images of animal cruelty and brief strong language; running time: 112 minutes.

New on Netflix \"Lovesick\" Season 2 (Netflix Original) This British comedy series was formerly known by the charming title \"Scrotal Recall,\" but now it's \"Lovesick,\" which may hint to a new direction in Season 2, which arrives for streaming November 17 on Netflix. In the series, Dylan (Johnny Flynn) discovers he has chlamydia and must contact all of his previous sexual partners to inform them. The story also involves his best friends, Luke (Daniel Ings), and Evie (Antonia Thomas), with Evie harboring a longtime crush on Dylan. \"Paranoid\" Season 1 (Netflix Original) This eight-part conspiracy thriller from Netflix and the U.K.'s ITV follows the aftermath of the murder of a female doctor in a rural children's playground. The series stars Kevin Doyle (Mr. Molesley from \"Downton Abbey\"), Indira Varma (Ellaria Sand from \"Game of Thrones\"), Lesley Sharp, Robert Glenister, and Dino Fetscher. Stream it on November 17. \"Divines\" (Netflix Original) In a housing estate on the outskirts of Paris, a shrewd teenager and her wisecracking best friend plan to get rich or die trying by following in the footsteps of a flashy female drug dealer. The French drama arrives on Netflix November 18. \"The 100\" Season 3 Stream the 16 freshest episodes of The CW's popular post-apocalyptic sci-fi drama starting November 16. Season 4 is scheduled to arrive sometime in 2017, so you should have plenty of time to catch up -- not only on Season 3, but on the whole series, if you want to start from the beginning. TV Worth Watching \"The Affair\" (Sunday on Showtime at 10 p.m.) Showtime's Golden Globe Award-winning drama returns for its third season November 20. One of the big twists this year is the addition of a new character perspective -- French actress Irene Jacob plays Noah's (Dominic West) new love interest, Juliette Le Gall. She is described as \"someone who is running from her own secrets and who helps Noah process a trauma from his past and understand himself a little better.\" Brendan Fraser also joins the cast as a mysterious prison guard. Here's the synopsis for the Season 3 premiere: \"Haunted by recent hardship, Noah struggles to navigate the challenges of his old life while attempting to adapt to a new one. A new love interest isn't enough to overcome a sense of dread. Someone is watching him.\" \"Good Behavior\" (Tuesday on TNT at 9 p.m.) Lady Mary is back, and the Dowager Countess would not approve of her indiscretions! In this new drama, based on the novella series by Blake Crouch, \"Downton Abbey\" alum Michelle Dockery plays Letty Dobesh, a thief and con artist recently released from prison. She's trying to keep her life on track, but when she overhears a hit man being hired to kill a man's wife, she tries to stop the job, sending her on a dangerous collision course with the killer. Juan Diego Botto, Terry Kinney, and Lusia Strus co-star in the series, which launches with a two-episode premiere November 15. \"Shooter\" (Tuesday on USA at 10 p.m.) Ryan Phillippe's new drama, based on the novel \"Point of Impact,\" has been trying to see the light of day for a while now. It was set to premiere in early July but was postponed due to the Dallas shootings. It was then pulled from the summer schedule after the Baton Rouge shootings. There are just too many real-life shootings to turn them into entertainment! But, in October, USA announced the new premiere date would be November 15, with Phillippe playing retired Marine sniper Bob Lee Swagger. In the first episode, Swagger is recruited by his former commander to prevent an assassination of the president, while FBI agent Nadine Memphis (Cynthia Addai-Robinson) investigates potential assassins.",

      "text": "Netflix \n\"Making a Murderer\" subject Steven Avery's attorney announced that they have just cleared a major legal hurdle in potentially proving his innocence.\nBack in August, Zellner filed a motion to carry out tests  on the case evidence in Wisconsin. Now nearly three months later, the tests can finally move forward.\n\" Agreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery,\" tweeted Zellner, who  hopes that this closer look at the evidence will prove that at least some of it was planted . \nTweet Embed:\nhttps://twitter.com/mims/statuses/797503725048893440\nAgreed Testing Order entered on Monday for Steven Avery. #MakingAMurderer \nAccording to Uproxx , that means the scope of Zellner's proposed testing has been decided. That requires an agreement between Avery's legal team and the prosecutors in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, where in 2007 Steven Avery was convicted of the murder of Teresa Halbach — a trial covered by Netflix's hit \"Making a Murderer.\" \nSpecifics on the tests will be revealed after Zellner files the order on Monday and it becomes available to the public. \nWhat we do know is that Zellner's original motion included requests to test the keys to victim Teresa Halbach's Toyota Rav4; various parts of the Rav4, including the hood latch where police found Avery's DNA; purple underwear discovered in the Avery scrap yard; and all previously collected swabs from the trial, including blood that Avery's lawyers have argued came from a vial of Avery's blood that was held by the police. \nAvery and his nephew, Brendan Dassey, were both found guilty of the 2005 murder of Halbach. A  judge  overturned Dassey's conviction in August , but Wisconsin prosecutors are fighting the decision .\nNOW WATCH: The defense attorneys from 'Making a Murderer' respond to criticism from Steven Avery’s new lawyer \n",

      "title": "Oscars: How This Year’s Docs Tackle Women’s Issues",
      "text": "COMMENTS Courtesy of Netflix Sexual assault survivor Coleman in 'Audrie & Daisy.' Her experience has helped other teens who have seen the Netflix doc. \"More female voices are being taken more seriously,\" says 'Audrie & Daisy' co-director Bonni Cohen as her film and others delve into sexual assault and reproductive rights in the U.S. and around the world. \nAudrie & Daisy directors Bonni Cohen and Jon Shenk say there's a reason this year's docs include several on women's issues: among them, Dawn Porter's Trapped , about reproductive rights; Hooligan Sparrow , Nanfu Wang's investigation of a child-rape case in China; and their film, which exposes the trauma of two teenage girls after sexual assaults against them end up on the internet. \"For sure, more female voices are being taken more seriously,\" says Cohen. \nCohen and Shenk wanted to reach out to kids like the real-life Audrie Pott and Daisy Coleman. Though social media connects teens, the directors say it also allows shaming and ridicule to go viral. For their subjects, the internet exposure was almost more painful than the physical assault. \"These girls are waking up to a public square of shame that is online,\" says Shenk. \nThe women in the film were drinking, and the directors say viewers often suggest they were asking for it. \"[It's], 'What about the alcohol?'… Does that mean our boys believe that gives them license to assault girls?\" asks Shenk. \nAlthough the helmers say their main goal was to bring Audrie & Daisy to theater audiences, they chose a distribution model with Netflix because it allows the film to reach teens in the privacy of their homes, including on their mobile devices. \nCohen describes a therapist friend who had urged a teen, who had been sexually assaulted but was afraid to go public, to watch Audrie & Daisy : \"'You can watch it on Netflix — you don't have to tell your parents,'\" she says. The girl later said Daisy's words in the doc spoke to exactly how she felt. \nThis story first appeared in a November standalone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Omega Advisors has rid itself of Netflix ( NFLX ) and continued to cut its stake in Facebook ( FB ) and Chimera Investments ( CIM ), while adding a stake in Chesapeake Energy ( CHK ) to its portfolio.\nBloomberg News/Landov The hedge fund run by Leon Cooperman , which was charged by the SEC in September with insider trading , disclosed in its quarterly 13F filing released today that it sold the 372,500 shares of Netflix it owned as of June 30 , while also slashing its position in Chimera by 47% to 2.4 million shares as of Sept. 30, cutting Dish Network ( DISH ) to 810,157 shares from just over 1.09 million shares and reducing its Facebook position to 278,100 shares form 322,400 . It also continued to cut its exposure to Dow Chemical ( DOW ) and American International Group ( AIG ).\nBut the filing showed that bought 1.14 million shares of Cliffs Natural Resources ( CLF ) and 273,650 shares of Chesapeake Energy, both new positions. It also took a 2.7 million share stake in Pandora Media ( P ).\nToday marks the deadline for big money managers to reveal holdings as of June 30 in 13F reports filed with the SEC. Requirement for investors managing more than $100 million, the quarterly filings disclose indicate the number of shares held and the value of each stake at the end of the quarter.\nJournalists and investors like to scrutinize — and in some cases copy – the portfolio moves of Wall Street titans like Warren Buffett and hedge fund gurus like Bill Ackman and Carl Icahn. For that reasons, the quarterly 13F filings are closely watched.",

Duffin ruled in August that investigators tricked Dassey into confessing he helped his uncle, Steven Avery, rape, kill and mutilate photographer Teresa Halbach in 2005. The state has appealed that ruling.\nDassey’s supervised release was not immediate and is contingent upon him meeting multiple conditions. He has until noon Tuesday to provide the federal probation and parole office with the address of where he planned to live.\nDassey was 16 when Halbach died. He’s now 27.",
