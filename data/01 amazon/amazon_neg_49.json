      "title": "(Update) All the best video game deals in Amazon's Black Friday sale",
      "text": "( Update:  Well, this is kind of awkward. Most of Amazon's Black Friday video game deals were available on Thanksgiving. There wasn't a whole lot that got added outside of the $99 black and white 3DSes that won't reliably stay in stock for extended periods of time.\nSo, what we're left with is basically yesterday's sale. Actually, in some ways, it's worse because a lot of those games sold out so there are fewer deals. But, the good news is that there is still a lot of decent stuff here, especially for those people who didn't get a chance to check it out yesterday. We've updated links and added a few entries to reflect deals that are current at the time of writing.\nAlso, wow did I ever botch that Vikings/Cowboys thing.]\nOriginal post:  It's like \"Train Kept a Rollin'\" by Aerosmith except the train is deals and it's not bad like most things by Aerosmith are bad. That's an awkward way to say that Amazon has even more video game discounts for Thanksgiving, and that's generally a good thing.\nThis is where things start to heat up. A lot of today's sales are from some of the biggest titles of 2016. The Dishonored 2  Limited Edition is $35. Doom  is $20. Dark Souls III  is $20. No Man's Sky  is $25. It goes on.\nHere are some of the best Thanksgiving video game deals we could find on Amazon. Some of them are holdovers from other days that seem pertinent to list again. If you don't see anything that suits you, well, Black Friday's just a day away.\nHappy Thanksgiving, and remember to responsibly mix family time with capitalistic pursuits. Also, spend your football time today praying for a Vikings win and a Cowboys loss. That, truly, would be the best deal.\n\nRead more... ",

      "text": "Amazon faces criticism over its handling of a special 3DS deal this Black Friday, with Nintendo fans left frustrated over being unable to pick up the deal. This Black Friday has seen a huge number of tantalizing deals left open to the gaming community. Although plenty of retailers offered up their own discounts to gamers, Amazon understandably has been drawing in the crowds after a bargain of their own, such as the Black Friday discounts for the PS4 Slim and Xbox One S . However, it turns out that not everyone has been happy with the online retailer and its sale methods during this season.\nAmazon gained plenty of traction from Nintendo fans over one deal in particular, which saw either a black or white limited edition Super Mario-themed Nintendo 3DS up for grabs for a paltry $99. Marking the first time that the handheld console was available for under $100, this Black Friday deal understandably had many gamers excited and ready to take advantage. However, when the deal became available, many found that they were unable to successfully purchase the console.\nThis was down to the fact that the deal was, somewhat bizarrely, available for pre-order as early as November 23. Savvy Amazon purchasers snapped up the pre-order stock quickly, resulting in those who were waiting for the deal to officially go live being met with sold out notifications. To make matters worse, those who had been able to get in early were then listing the device on the site at nearly double the price .\n\nUnderstandably, those who felt cheated by the perceived blunder then took their frustrations out on Amazon itself, leaving less than positive reviews on the limited edition console’s page. “My kid went around and did jobs for neighbors in hopes of scoring one of these with his own money, managed to save it up in time, and stayed up until midnight refreshing the screen to get his hard earned prize,” wrote one of the angry users. “He was rewarded with the lesson that big businesses often do dirty deeds to their most loyal customers.”\nSince that point, Amazon has sporadically added more stock, but these updates have been few and far between. As it stands, the product is still standing as sold out, aside from those selling the product as a third party at a much higher price point. Thankfully, Amazon was not the only retailer who had the deal up, with the 3DS available alongside other Nintendo discounts at shops such as Walmart and Best Buy, but the anger for Amazon still remained.\nIt’s not the only time that a Nintendo product has suffered from stock shortages, with the NES Mini crashing Amazon after selling out, and the limited availability of the Pokemon GO Plus peripheral even leading to a statement from Nintendo on the matter. Hopefully, this 3DS deal will be on the receiving end of some kind of increased availability soon.\nSource: Polygon \n",

Based on a Market Track study of holiday circulars, Walmart is offering an average discount of 39 percent, compared with 35 percent last year. At Target, the price cuts grew to 38 percent from 36 percent.\n“With the lines between traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce continuing to blur, the need to make a big splash during large retail events like Black Friday is significant,” Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, said in an e-mailed statement. “The ease of comparison shopping across channels is creating a situation that puts a definitive advantage in the consumers’ hands.”\nWalmart and others also are steering customers toward online deals, rather than just physical stores. While the chain still offers Black Friday specials at its supercenters, the day marks the beginning of a streak of online promotions called “Cyber Week.” Walmart has tripled its e-commerce selection to 23 million products this year, aiming to better compete with Amazon. The world’s largest retailer said in a statement Friday that Thanksgiving was one of its top online-shopping days this year and that about 70 percent of the traffic to its website came from mobile devices.\nRelated Articles November 25, 2016 Retailers gird for battle against online sales, offering far more in-store deals than before November 25, 2016 Sunny and warm for Black Friday in Denver November 24, 2016 Colorado advocacy group warns holiday shoppers about recalled toys November 23, 2016 Retailers are prepped to make sure Black Friday sales rush runs smoothly for shoppers — and sellers November 23, 2016 Expect more elbow room in stores on Black Friday Target, meanwhile, is offering 15 percent off almost everything in its stores and website for two days: Sunday and Monday. The aggressive discounts come at a cost. When Target slashed prices last holiday season, its profit margin slipped to 27.9 percent from 28.5 percent.\nThe retailer said that Target.com saw double-digit growth on Thanksgiving, marking its biggest day ever, driven by deals on electronics. Televisions, Apple Inc. products and wearable gadgets were among the top sellers.\nSpreading Out The National Retail Federation estimates that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that started on Thanksgiving. But the amount that Americans have spent has declined in the past three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person in 2015.\nThat’s a sign that holiday purchases are spreading out over a longer time frame. Spending during the overall season — November and December — is still expected to grow 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, the NRF estimates.\nWith Americans shifting their purchases online, the urgency of offering deals on Black Friday itself has diminished. EBay Inc. made a plea for consumers to start shopping on their phones the day before Thanksgiving, christening the event “Mobile Wednesday.”\nOne thing giving retailers optimism this year: There may be pent-up demand after a polarizing presidential election. Many chains, including Kohl’s Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc., blamed the campaign season for hurting spending. With the outcome settled, they’re expecting the dollars to finally flow.\nOptimistic Investors Investors are bullish as well. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Retail Index has risen 4.9 percent so far in November and is on pace for its best monthly return since July. Retail stocks have outpaced the broader market following the election, with the index up 4.7 percent since Nov. 8.\nHistorical studies indicate that elections affect the timing of retail sales rather than the overall volume, said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co. That means shoppers will usually spend the same amount, even if the election puts them off spending for a while.\n“Hopefully, when we get to Black Friday, which really tolls the bell of holiday shopping, then the consumer will start looking forward to Christmas,” Storch said.\nThe challenge for traditional retailers is preventing consumers from becoming “locked in” at Amazon. Many shoppers begin their product searches there — and never leave.\nAmazon Focused “If Amazon had everything, like everything you need in the world, I would buy everything from there,” said Oscar Viral, a 58-year-old chef in New York. “I wanted something from Macy’s, and I got on the internet because they didn’t have it available in the store.”\nAmazon said on Friday that mobile orders on Thanksgiving topped last year’s holiday and Cyber Monday combined. Black Friday is on pace to beat last year in terms of items orders. Top-selling items include Instant Pot cookers, Hasbro Inc.’s Pie Face game and Amazon’s Alexa devices.\nNo matter when they shop, customers will be hunting for bargains. While a survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83 percent of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season, mobile phones are making price comparisons simpler than ever.\n“We like to scope it out in person, then we go online,” said Natalie Kelly, a hospitality worker in Florida who was shopping at a mall in Manhattan earlier this week. “To get me to go into the department store, things would have to be discounted more than they are online.”",

      "text": "Microsoft has released the world’s most advanced container service via Windows Server 2016. \nMeanwhile, Amazon has made a deal with VMware for diversifying its hybrid cloud offerings. \nContainers will allow Microsoft not to lose ground against Amazon. \nGoldman Sachs recently upgraded Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) to buy from neutral, and raised price target to $68 from $60. Goldman Sachs believes that Microsoft's gross profit will grow at an accelerating pace and gross profit margin will improve due to Azure's cloud opportunities. \nSince profitability is a matter of managerial accounting and difficult to predict, I'm not sure about profitability. However, I believe Microsoft's revenue will rise significantly going forward since the company is offering customers the world's most sophisticated, advanced and diversified container support via its recent launch of Windows Server 2016. Containers also will help Microsoft win the war against Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) AWS despite the latter's recent deal with VMware (NYSE: VMW ). \nContainers: Microsoft's New Growth Driver \nWindows Server 2016, Microsoft's latest server operating system, will help Microsoft's customers run applications both off-premises (via Azure) and on-premises with equal efficiency, which will make Microsoft a stronger hybrid cloud player in the IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) market. Containers will help Microsoft boost its cloud revenue. \nUse of containers will rise substantially in datacenters with Microsoft's extended and advanced support for Docker containers via Windows Server 2016. As a result, Microsoft will achieve two things. Gradually containers will become the standard mode of virtualization for lighter, web-based applications instead of VMs (virtual machines). With supporting container-based virtualization, Microsoft will be able to grab a significant part of the market share of cloud infrastructure leader Amazon. Microsoft provides its cloud infrastructure services primarily to large corporations. With extending the benefits of containers to SMBs (small and medium businesses) via Nano Server, Microsoft's cloud presence will expand in the SMB space as well. \nContainers Will Make Microsoft Stronger Than AWS \nContainers offer virtualization by consuming much less system resources compared to VMs. While VMs need an entire OS (operating system) to run along with copies of hardware the OS uses, for containers, a portion of an OS is sufficient. In addition, containers can accommodate more apps compared to VMs. \nHowever, since containers share the kernel of the host OS, they are less secure. Microsoft has released two types of containers, namely Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers. Enterprises can deploy the containers via Docker APIs and Docker client. Hyper-V containers are capable of providing a container its own kernel for offering more security. \nNow the question is how Microsoft will be able to grab Amazon's market share? Amazon and VMware made a deal in October for extending the latter's VM-based server virtualization platform vSphere into AWS public cloud. For running on-premises applications on cloud they need to be rewritten, which is a difficult and time-consuming task. The deal aims to make the task a lot easier and faster. \nDespite being a strong VM-based virtualization player, VMware's presence in the public cloud market is insignificant. On the other hand, Amazon doesn't have a strong presence in the hybrid cloud market. While VMware's interest in the deal is to expand its public cloud footprint, Amazon's interest is capturing the hybrid cloud market. The Amazon-VMware deal will intensify competition in the hybrid cloud space, and Microsoft will also feel competitive pressure. Containers will help Microsoft fight competition. \nServer virtualization is a crucial cloud infrastructure component. Microsoft already has a stable VM-based virtualization market share. It offers both Linux VMs and Windows Server VMs via Azure. Now it is offering sophisticated container-based virtualization, which makes it the world's leading virtualization company. Microsoft has a rich portfolio of software suites targeted at the IaaS space, which the company will be able to sell to customers that will use its virtualization platforms. \nMicrosoft has introduced Nano Server with Windows Server 2016. Nano Server is a smaller version of Windows Server 2016. It's actually 20-25 times smaller compared to Windows Server 2016 and targeted at the SMB segment, as mentioned above. Nano Server can be used as the OS for both Windows Server containers and Hyper-V containers. As a result, SMBs can use most of the features of Docker containers. Nano Server will help Microsoft address the needs of relatively small companies. \nConclusion \nI believe Microsoft will come significantly closer to Amazon when Windows Server 2016 and Azure Stack will dominate the cloud IaaS market in full swing. In a previous article , I discussed the prospects of Microsoft's upcoming Azure Stack. According to VentureBeat , Microsoft's revenue from Azure climbed 116% in the third quarter of this year compared to Amazon's 58% in the second quarter. Clearly, Microsoft is growing faster and about to surpass Amazon. Disclosure: I am/we are long MSFT.    ",

      "text": "Trump hat ornament draws ire of Amazon reviewers Posted: Updated: A Donald Trump-inspired Christmas ornament has been bombarded with negative reviews on Amazon. (Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - Holiday shopping took a political turn on Amazon after a Donald Trump themed Christmas ornament popped up on the retail giant's marketplace. \nThe ornament is in the shape of Trump signature red hat, which he donned on the campaign trail. It simply reads across the top \"Make American Great Again.\" \nThough the ornament is no longer available, the reviews have become a sounding board for critics of the president-elect. Many reviewers left snarky comments parodying Trump, while others more directly criticized the president-elect. \nOne reviewer even brought Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton into the fray, taking fire a Trump's defeat in the popular vote. \n\"There was a blue ornament,\" reviewer bmfc1 wrote. \"It was smarter than this one, had a lifetime of experience, supported trees of all colors and beliefs, and - get this - was love by two million more people than this ornament.\" \nMore than 80 percent of the item's reviewers are one-star, but even the five-star reviews are mostly sarcastic parodies of Trump's candidacy. \nAs of Friday morning, it had a total review score of 1.7. \nAmazon is no longer selling the ornament, but it is available from other sellers. Most are listed for more than $200 a piece. \nCopyright 2016 CNN. All rights reserved. Trump in transition President-elect Donald Trump More>>",

Trying to get one for my girlfriend, and once again, Nintendo is supporting scalpers, why don't they make enough of these things when they know demand will be insane. Most stores are receiving like 10 or 12 of them, they should be getting a f$&king pallet. I'm not a Nintendo fan, but my girlfriend is, tired of seeing her sad because the Nintendo treats their fans like sh!t.",

      "text": "In this May 9, 2013, file photo, a worker pushes shopping carts in front of a Wal-Mart store in La Habra, Calif. (Jae C. Hong / Associated Press) FRIDAY, NOV. 25, 2016, 3 P.M. Holiday price war intensifies as Wal-Mart, Target pursue Amazon By Lindsey Rupp and Sarah Very Bloomberg Twitter \nWal-Mart, Target and other brick-and-mortar chains are counting on heavier discounts and a bigger online selection to keep up with Amazon.com this holiday season. \nAs Black Friday ushers in the year-end shopping rush, chains are touting larger price cuts than in 2015 — a gamble that maintaining market share is worth squeezing margins. Based on a Market Track study of holiday circulars, Wal-Mart is offering an average discount of 39 percent, compared with 35 percent last year. At Target, the price cuts grew to 38 percent from 36 percent. \n“With the lines between traditional brick and mortar and e-commerce continuing to blur, the need to make a big splash during large retail events like Black Friday is significant,” Traci Gregorski, senior vice president of marketing at Market Track, said in an e-mailed statement. “The ease of comparison shopping across channels is creating a situation that puts a definitive advantage in the consumers’ hands.” \nWal-Mart and others also are steering customers toward online deals, rather than just physical stores. While the chain still offers Black Friday specials at its supercenters, the day marks the beginning of a streak of online promotions called “Cyber Week.” Wal-Mart has tripled its e-commerce selection to 23 million products this year, aiming to better compete with Amazon. The world’s largest retailer said in a statement Friday that Thanksgiving was one of its top online-shopping days this year and that about 70 percent of the traffic to its website came from mobile devices. \nTarget, meanwhile, is offering 15 percent off almost everything in its stores and website for two days: Sunday and Monday. The aggressive discounts come at a cost. When Target slashed prices last holiday season, its profit margin slipped to 27.9 percent from 28.5 percent. \nThe National Retail Federation estimates that about 137.4 million consumers will make purchases in stores or online over the four-day weekend that started on Thanksgiving. But the amount that Americans have spent has declined in the past three years, slipping 26 percent from 2013 to an average of $299.60 per person in 2015. \nThat’s a sign that holiday purchases are spreading out over a longer time frame. Spending during the overall season – November and December – is still expected to grow 3.6 percent to $655.8 billion, the NRF estimates. \nWith Americans shifting their purchases online, the urgency of offering deals on Black Friday itself has diminished. EBay made a plea for consumers to start shopping on their phones the day before Thanksgiving, christening the event “Mobile Wednesday.” \nOne thing giving retailers optimism this year: There may be pent-up demand after a polarizing presidential election. Many chains, including Kohl’s Corp., Gap Inc. and Barnes & Noble Inc., blamed the campaign season for hurting spending. With the outcome settled, they’re expecting the dollars to finally flow. \nInvestors are bullish as well. The Standard & Poor’s 500 Retail Index has risen 4.9 percent so far in November and is on pace for its best monthly return since July. Retail stocks have outpaced the broader market following the election, with the index up 4.7 percent since Nov. 8. \nHistorical studies indicate that elections affect the timing of retail sales rather than the overall volume, said Jerry Storch, chief executive officer of Saks Fifth Avenue owner Hudson’s Bay Co. That means shoppers will usually spend the same amount, even if the election puts them off spending for a while. \n“Hopefully, when we get to Black Friday, which really tolls the bell of holiday shopping, then the consumer will start looking forward to Christmas,” Storch said. \nThe challenge for traditional retailers is preventing consumers from becoming “locked in” at Amazon. Many shoppers begin their product searches there – and never leave. \n“If Amazon had everything, like everything you need in the world, I would buy everything from there,” said Oscar Viral, 58, a chef in New York. “I wanted something from Macy’s, and I got on the internet because they didn’t have it available in the store.” \nNo matter when they shop, customers will be hunting for bargains. While a survey of about 1,000 U.S. consumers by AlixPartners indicated that 83 percent of shoppers expect to spend about the same or more this holiday season, mobile phones are making price comparisons simpler than ever. \n“We like to scope it out in person, then we go online,” said Natalie Kelly, a hospitality worker in Florida who was shopping at a mall in Manhattan earlier this week. “To get me to go into the department store, things would have to be discounted more than they are online.” Published: Nov. 25, 2016, 3 p.m.",

      "text": "With the holiday season just around the corner, mKitchen World, Amazon’s favourite kitchen brand is excited to announce their offer. Customers have the chance to buy their Marshmallow Roasting Sticks set and the Silicone Basting Brushes with 50% discount and automatically become members of the mKitchen World Vip Club which comes with a number of benefits. Membership in the mKitchen World VIP Club is normally offered to customers who purchase more than three products. With this limited time holiday offer, with the purchase of a set of marshmallow roasting sticks or silicone basting brushes, customers receive instant membership into the Club. The Vip Club benefits include free product insurance (product replaced free of charge or refund if the product has or develops a fault), exclusive access to new products with the chance to test them for free, big discount coupons during promotional campaigns and 50% off any next purchase from mKitchen World.\nEnhanced with safety and comfort features, mKitchen World’s set of 5 marshmallow roasting sticks are excellent cookware for open campfires, BBQ or portable grills. Made from food-grade non-toxic 304 stainless steel with heat-resistant rubber handles, the sticks are extendable to 45\" and are perfectly safe for kids. They come with protective removable rubber tips so they won't poke any fingers when not in use. Great for safely roasting hot dogs, marshmallows, shrimp, potatoes, corn on the cob, baked potatoes, sausages or cherry tomatoes, the roasting sticks can be used when hiking, backpacking, mountaineering, camping, fishing, hunting and boating. When purchasing the product, a canvas pouch for transport and easy storage is also provided.\nThe versatile silicone brushes are designed to make baking, basting and cooking easier. Made from BPA-free silicone, they are heat-resistant up to high temperatures. The silicone bristles won’t fray or shed, do not absorb odour and they last longer than regular brushes. They can be used on non-stick pans and the lightweight handle provides a soft comfortable firm grip making basting easy. The small brush is perfect for spreading liquids and glazes onto the surface of foods, like adding melted butter to the tops of cinnamon buns or some milk/cream to the top of a muffin before sprinkling it with coarse sugar. The bigger brush is a basting brush and is great for glazing meats and fish.The Silicone Brushes come in a set of 2, in four different colours: orange, red, green and blue. Customers will receive 2 e-Books with pastry and basting sauces recipes.\nThe offer ends on December 24th. To enter the mKitchen World Vip Club customers have to send an email to sales(at)mkitchenworld(dot)com with their name, address, email and Amazon order number.\nAbout mKitchen World\nThe brand was created in 2015 as a result of its founder’s passion for innovative and creative kitchen gadgets designed to save valuable time, make life easier in the kitchen, stand out and be efficient at the same time. Offering top-class customer service, the brand’s success recipe is seeing every customer as a member of the mKitchen World family, listening to their feedback and implementing it straightaway.

So when you add these two together, diapers are 40% off! \nAs shown in the Amazon Shopping Cart screenshot below, the original price is $37.09, the 20 percent coupon saves $7.42 and the 20 percent for Amazon Family saves $7.42. The total savings is $14.84, which is a savings of 40 percent. Here’s the final price for a box of diapers when added to your cart.",

It’s a hectic time but there will be a lot of down time amid the chaos; Amazon Prime has you covered this December.\nReturning to Amazon’s streaming service are two of its most popular and critically acclaimed original series: Man in the High Castle and Mozart in the Jungle . Man in the High Castle is returning for its second season and explores an alternate reality in which Nazis won World World II and secretly control the US. Mozart in the Jungle is returning for its third season. The series follows maestro Rodrigo (portrayed by a fantastic Gael García Bernal), the conductor for the New York Symphony, as he tries to balance his love for music, his orchestra and all the politics involved with work.\nIf you’re more into movies, Amazon Prime has you covered as well. The service is adding a nice helping of content covering many genres. The Mark Wahlberg and Will Farrell comedy Daddy’s Home , the Woody Allen original flick Café Society starring Jesse Eisenberg and the critically acclaimed indie movie, The Lobster will be available to stream this December\nThe complete list of additions is much longer.

      "text": "Black Friday just arrived despite a full week of sales, but it feels like it’s already over. That’s because most retailers out there began selling their discounted products much earlier than normal this year. Some sales began on Monday, while most online shops opened on Thanksgiving as retailers focused on attracting as many buyers as possible to their online storefronts. You no longer have to deal with annoying people, long lines, or a rush for the limited number of doorbuster deals available — well, you still have to hurry when completing that online purchase, since deals are only good as long as supply last.\nAmazon is, of course, the king of online shopping in the US, and the company had its own early Black Friday sales. While it may still be Black Friday today and Amazon is offering its best deals of the week right now , the retailer already has Cyber Monday deals lined up for you as well.\nDEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now!\nAmazon’s Cyber Monday 2016 sale covers a variety of products, and we’re going to highlight some of the best deals in the coming hours.

      "text": "Amazon reviewers have fun with Trump's $149 Christmas ornament William Cummings , USA TODAY 7:08 p.m. EST November 25, 2016 136 Shares x Share Looks like Donald Trump wants to make Christmas great again. He is selling this unique ornament on his website for $149. Wochit \nThe election is over and Donald Trump is the president-elect, but there's still plenty of campaign merchandise to be had. One item for sale on the Trump campaign website is a Christmas ornament designed to look like one of the iconic \"Make America Great Again\" hats. \nThis particular item has drawn attention in recent days, primarily because it is finished in 24-karat gold and costs $149. \nIt is also available for sale on Amazon — which claims it is actually 14K gold — at an even steeper asking price of $222 and up. As with Megyn Kelly's recently published memoir, there appears to be a politically-motivated effort to bring down the ornament's Amazon rating. Of the 121 reviews published as of 6:45 p.m. ET Friday, 75% gave the Trumpian holiday decoration the lowest rating of one star. \nSome of the one-star reviews poked fun at Trump and his victory despite losing the popular vote, saying they were stuck with the ornament even though they didn't choose it. Others just mocked the president-elect. Here are some samples: Yuge ornament \nDespite ordering a more reasonable ornament, this one arrived. It. Is. Yuge. It's absolutely yuge. It's the biggest ornament. Yuge. I hung it on my tree, but it is so yuge that it has totally unbalanced my whole tree. No matter where I hang it, the tree leans w y over to the far right. Not what I wanted \nEvery autumn my family chooses a new ornament to go onto our holiday tree. This year it was between this ornament and another one that is less flashy, less gaudy, and just overall nicer. During our family meeting we overwhelmingly chose the other ornament but somehow we still ended up with this one. We're not sure what happened. The Blue Ornament Was Better \nThere was a blue ornament, it was smarter than this one, had a lifetime of experience, supported trees of all colors and beliefs, and (get this) was loved by two million more people than this ornament but somehow we're stuck with this ornament. Great for your drunken uncle \nJust the alt-right size to fit on the head of the tRump supporter in your family. Great for your drunken uncle, or your neo-nazi punk cousin. Warning! This ornament will ruin your data plan, as it's constantly spewing inane tweets at 3:30am. Sad. \nLow energy ornament. I will not be Putin this on my tree \nWhile it says that it will \"Make America Great Again\" after it hangs on your tree for a while you get the distinct impression that this is the center of a Russian nesting ornament and it is being sold to us under false pretenses. It's like a disease of the mind \nSome of my family members ordered this. We fought about why it clashed with everything we stood for, but they can't seem to hear anything we say. They keep calling us losers and liars. It's like a disease of the mind, this not hearing anything. Soon, the holidays will be over and we are hoping by then the thing will be put away where it belongs. Read or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2g0Vxg2 Most Popular",

The Senior Craftsmen is pleased to announce the perfect holiday gift idea for $5 dollars and under. This holiday season, buying a cool high quality gift, doesn’t have to be expensive. Ontario, OR – The Senior Craftsmen is pleased to announce the perfect holiday gift idea for $5 dollars and under on Amazon. According to the professionals, sales are expected to rise 3 to 4% for the upcoming holiday season. So why not make your buying power go further? “We searched high and low to make this list,” says Marie Golden – the newsletter spokesperson. She continues to say, “I wanted to find the type of gift that I would like to give or even get myself. Some gift guides often recommend “gag” gifts or items that are not usable. We had to have the item not only have positive ratings, but give you the ultimate value.” In many ways, gifts can be a difficult decision to make. However, if the gift is usable or even a tool, you really can't go wrong. Tools and gadgets have emerged as one of the most popular stocking stuffer, but this year we added some new categorizes that will sure to please everyone. All for $5 bucks and under! Ready for the whole list? Have at it.",

      "text": "Amazon Announces Cyber Monday Details for Its Echo Don't want to fight crowds on Black Friday? No problem. Amazon November 25, 2016 S hoppers around the world know that the best deals can usually be found in stores on Black Friday. But don’t go spending all your Christmas money just yet. Today, Amazon.com revealed its plans for Cyber Monday, and the deals promise to be every bit as enticing as the ones for Black Friday, but shoppers won’t have to deal with crowded storefronts. The online retailer says there will be over 75,000 deals starting on Monday , with new deals every five minutes — including their popular Echo devices . This time last year, Amazon reported that customers around the world ordered more than 54 million items — that’s a staggering 629 items each second — and this year they expect to surpass those numbers. Amazon’s Alexa-powered Echo, is like a Star Trek computer for your home, able to answer questions, control other household devices, and even tell corny jokes. The device has been going for $179.99, but on Cyber Monday, you can snap one up for only $139.99. Pair that with a couple hockey puck-shaped Echo dots for $39.99 each, and you will have a fully-functioning smart home in no time. Unfortunately, you will still have to make your own coffee. If the sleek, black design of the Echo products just doesn’t do it for you, Amazon will allow you to transfer the smart assistant into other devices, as the company recently opened up Alexa’s API to developers. So far, we’ve seen Alexa turn a talking wall-mounted fish , into a creepy robotic terror. But really, you can now turn any device into something a bit more practical, thanks to Alexa. Also of note in the Cyber Monday deals, are Amazon’s Dash Buttons, which lets consumers order various household items at the click of a button. On Monday you will be able to order a variety of buttons for just .99 cents each, and as a bonus, customers will receive a $4.99 credit back after their first purchase. Amazon says new deals will be added constantly and that consumers can download a special, free Amazon shopping app that will help track deals via special alerts. Head over to Cyber Monday , and preview some of the hot new offers before the sales officially kick off on November 28. As always, if you want to give back while you shop, just go over to Amazon Smile and pick out your favorite charity. Every time you shop, Amazon will donate a portion of the profits.",

      "text": "Amazon announces Cyber Monday 2016 sale – here’s everything you need to know Chris Smith Pin it Share Black Friday just arrived despite a full week of sales, but it feels like it’s already over. That’s because most retailers out there began selling their discounted products much earlier than normal this year. Some sales began on Monday, while most online shops opened on Thanksgiving as retailers focused on attracting as many buyers as possible to their online storefronts. You no longer have to deal with annoying people, long lines, or a rush for the limited number of doorbuster deals available — well, you still have to hurry when completing that online purchase, since deals are only good as long as supply last. Amazon is, of course, the king of online shopping in the US, and the company had its own early Black Friday sales. While it may still be Black Friday today and Amazon is offering its best deals of the week right now , the retailer already has Cyber Monday deals lined up for you as well. DEAL ALERT: The best Black Friday sale of the year is happening right now! Amazon’s Cyber Monday 2016 sale covers a variety of products, and we’re going to highlight some of the best deals in the coming hours.

      "text": "Amazon Reveals Cyber Week Deals, Many Available Now!   Alexander Maxham \nBlack Friday is about half over, well depending on what side of the country you’re on, and Amazon is already looking towards Cyber Monday which is this coming Monday, November 28th. They are planning to have over 75,000 deals available on Cyber Monday and throughout the week. Many of these deals are actually already available now. Including discounts on the Amazon Echo, Amazon Tap and Amazon Echo Dot. \nSome of the other deals that Amazon is offering up next week include the Amazon Fire Kids Edition tablet for just $75, the Amazon Dash buttons for just $.99 with a $4.99 credit after your purchase. There’s also a 50-inch 1080p LED TV available for $145, a 50-inch 4K Smart TV for $249, 40% off HP laptops and many more. One deal that is already available and will continue next week that is definitely worth noting and taking advantage of is the Sonos PLAY:1 speaker. This is a speaker that runs on WiFi and connects to other Sonos products through your home. By connecting over WiFi, it provides even better sound quality for whatever music you are playing back. It’s also dead simple to set up. \nThese sales will be starting up around 3AM EST on November 28th, along with many, many Lightning deals. You’ll want to act fast as some of these will be limited time and have limited quantities – meaning that as soon as they sell out, the sale price is gone. Amazon isn’t the only one holding massive Cyber Monday or Cyber Week sales next week. Many other retailers are still focused on Black Friday, but will be releasing their Cyber Monday sales in the next few hours and over the weekend. \nWhat’s interesting about Amazon’s Cyber Week Deals is that with Amazon Prime Now, users can actually get their orders delivered to them within an hour. Of course this is only in markets that have Prime Now, but it’s still a great service, especially if you’re buying something that you need right away. You won’t even need to wait until the next day for it to be delivered, it’ll be there within an hour. There will also be plenty of deals available through Alexa, which means you’ll need an Alexa-powered device to take advantage of them, like the Echo, or Amazon Tap.",

This printer is also now air print compatible … meaning you can print coupons from your phone and tablets!! \nI am a big fan of Brother printers and always suggest them when people ask for a great coupon printer. Laser Printers use toner instead of ink and cost pennies compared to inkjets. \nWhen you need a replacement toner cartridge (which is around $11), it will yield around 2,600 pages! \nNote: Prices on Amazon may change at any time. Shipping is FREE. Add A Comment Marte Archer \nnot smart to use generic cartridge replacement, we have a brother laser printer and the correct cartridge is thirty four dollars from amazon James \nIf u go to staples they will price match this and take an extra 10% off Search by Item \nLooking for a deal on something specific?

      "text": "Amazon will spend $1 billion to conquer the Middle East By buying local e-commerce giant Souq.com. Save Ted S. Warren / AP \nAmazon is one of the world's largest retail destinations, but it doesn't have much traction in the Middle East. That's why rumors that it's looking to buy Souq.com , the Amazon of the Middle East, make so much sense. Bloomberg is reporting that Jeff Bezos and crew might spend up to $1 billion on the site to gain a foothold across Egypt, Saudi Arabia and the UAE. Neither party is talking about the deal, but if it's getting reported in an august financial publication like Bloomberg then it must be serious. \nSouq has looked to solve challenges that aren't so prominent in the US and other countries where Amazon is dominant. Inc. profiled the company a few months ago, revealing that the retailer had to develop a new payment platform for a region where credit cards aren't ubiquitous. So, users are able to shop for products by topping up a prepaid card available at various brick-and-mortar retail outlets. Another issue is logistics, since some regions don't have as sophisticated delivery services as others -- but perhaps that's something that Amazon can help with.",

      "title": "Wholeness Home Releases Fancy Gold Stringed Christmas Gift Tags on Amazon",
      "text": "November 23, 2016 – /PressAdvantage/ – Wholeness Home, a home and garden company based in Pasadena, California has announced the launch of their Fancy Christmas Gift Tags with Gold String in the Amazon Marketplace. Wholeness Home is known for providing a wide array of items for the home, including Kitchen and Baking tools as well as novelty items.\nThe Christmas Gift Tags are their first seasonal offerings. Annie French, of Wholeness Home, explains that the company has been looking for manufacturers to produce high end, but reasonably priced tags for the past two years. She says, “Many of us love to spend time wrapping our gifts and making them look beautiful on the outside as we know they will be prominently displayed in the homes of our friends under their tree. So often all the attention goes into the wrapping and not into the to/from tags we attached to them. We wanted our tags to have gold string, that can be tied to a bow, would fit easily over a wine bottle or be attached to a special gift bag.”\nThe Christmas gift tags come in 16 different styles, from snowmen, ornaments and jingle bells to Christmas trees and a variety of Santas. There are 8 cards in each style for a total of 128 separate tags. The tags come in a carrying case that can hang on the wall or fold down to one quarter its size for easy storage for the ones saved for next year. They are decorated with light glitter so they will shimmer in the lights under a Christmas tree and each has a golden string. The tags also include a variety of colors for those who like to color coordinate their gift wrap and tags. With this much assortment and so many tags in the set, it may well be the only gift card tage purchase one needs this season.\nThey are currently only available in the Amazon marketplace. They will be available on Thanksgiving Day and Ms. French expects that due to the limited quantity they will sell out quickly.

      "text": "\nEach week, we scour Amazon’s list of recently published eBooks to find the most outrageous trash-erotica, libellous tell-all, outlandish conspiracy theory and bizarre personal memoir to share with you, our dear readers. \nThis week’s selection is: \nOne Fell Sweep (Innkeeper Chronicles Book 3) Ilona Andrews NYLA 259 pp; $4.88 \nThe grossest place I ever stayed was in Manitoba, somewhere near the Ontario border. I was driving across the country, and had pushed my limits to remain awake behind the wheel for a bit too long. Feeling myself begin to lose concentration on the road, I pulled off into the first motel I found. \nAt first, there was a romantic charm attached to how rundown it was. The innkeeper clearly lived on the premises, with the front desk area seconding as a living room (or maybe vice versa). He didn’t ask for a credit card or any form of identification, just the $60 it cost to spend the night in one of the motel units. Judging by how few cars were in front of these units, I doubted that business was booming. And it made me feel good to stay in such a place: off the beaten path, rough around the edges, informal, no frills. It was somehow refreshing to know that places like this still existed, where the bare minimum of lodging could be experienced while having no questions asked of a weary traveler. \nThen, I got to my unit. It smelled like an ashtray. There were weird stains on the carpet. I found whiskers in the sink. And the complimentary bar of hand soap had partially yellowed. I positioned myself above the blankets on the bed, with my own dirty laundry as a blanket. It may not have been much cleaner than the bedding underneath, but at least this was my filth, and not a stranger’s. \nLaying there, my exhaustion dissipated, and I turned on a nearby television set (so old, it had dials), hoping to be distracted from thinking about my surroundings. It had a single channel, which I quickly learned was connected to whatever the innkeeper was watching. We watched a Mad Men rerun, some CNN during the commercial breaks. It was all very nice as I began to drift off to sleep. That is until Mad Men finished, and a round of channel surfing brought the dear innkeeper to some soft-core pornography. Related eBook of the Weak: Mr. President, because ‘he’ll rule her as firmly as he’ll rule the country’ \nI turned off the television, and laid between my dirty laundry and the bedding with a dusty film on it, wondering why an innkeeper would decide to watch pornography on an open channel like that. I decided that there was no good answer to such a query. \nVisitors to Dina DeMille’s Bed and Breakfast in Red Deer, Texas, need never face such difficult questions. DeMille, the protagonist in One Fell Sweep, caters to a very particular kind of guest. The kind that no one on Earth is supposed to know about: a former intergalactic tyrant with a bounty on her head, the Lord Marshal of a powerful vampire clan, a displaced (and super-hot) werewolf and, most importantly, a robot whose last chance at saving his civilization could bring death and disaster to all Dina holds dear. \nSo, who knows? Maybe this place would be worse than my Manitoba porn motel. The point here is probably to always check with Trip Advisor. ",

Although Prime Now offers just a small subset of Amazon's overall product selection, that's the best combined discount we've seen on this service.

(Source: Amazon/CNN) \n(CNN) - Holiday shopping took a political turn on Amazon after a Donald Trump themed Christmas ornament popped up on the retail giant's marketplace. \nThe ornament is in the shape of Trump signature red hat, which he donned on the campaign trail. It simply reads across the top \"Make American Great Again.\" \nThough the ornament is no longer available, the reviews have become a sounding board for critics of the president-elect. Many reviewers left snarky comments parodying Trump, while others more directly criticized the president-elect. \nOne reviewer even brought Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton into the fray, taking fire a Trump's defeat in the popular vote. \n\"There was a blue ornament,\" reviewer bmfc1 wrote. \"It was smarter than this one, had a lifetime of experience, supported trees of all colors and beliefs, and - get this - was love by two million more people than this ornament.\" \nMore than 80 percent of the item's reviewers are one-star, but even the five-star reviews are mostly sarcastic parodies of Trump's candidacy. \nAs of Friday morning, it had a total review score of 1.7. \nAmazon is no longer selling the ornament, but it is available from other sellers. Most are listed for more than $200 a piece. \nCopyright 2016 CNN. All rights reserved. Trump in transition President-elect Donald Trump More>>",

      "title": "Amazon puts new limit on customer reviews: No more than 5 a week except for verified purchases",
      "text": "Amazon will put new limits on reviews except in cases where the purchase has been verified. Amazon will start capping the number of product reviews any customer can submit in a given week, limiting each person to five/week except for products that have been verified by the company as purchased by the reviewer.\nBooks, music and video are exempt from the limit, but the new cap applies to the rest of Amazon’s vast online selection of products.\nIt’s the latest move by the e-commerce giant to police its online reviews, a critical resource used by many online shoppers to assess products before buying. The news comes during the peak holiday shopping season, the most important time of year for Amazon, as the company aims to get even more people shopping online.\nSome of Amazon’s more prolific reviewers received emails this week informing them of the new cap, as reported by Nate Hoffelder of The Digital Reader . An Amazon spokeswoman confirmed the changes in a message to GeekWire, and they’re spelled out in Amazon’s updated Community Guidelines .\n“We are introducing a policy change around customer reviews,” said spokeswoman Angie Newman via email. “Customers can now only submit a limited number of non-Amazon Verified Purchase reviews a week. The limit is five and the count is calculated from Sunday at 12:00am UTC through Saturday 11:59pm UTC . Customer’s ability to submit Amazon Verified Purchase reviews will not be impacted. This policy also does not apply to Vine reviews or reviews on digital and physical books, music, and video.”\nShe added, “We’re always innovating on behalf of our customers and shoppers consistently tell us that they value reviews from other shoppers who they know have purchased the product on Amazon.”\nAmazon’s review system has been in the spotlight in recent days as the company reportedly suppressed some negative reviews and ratings of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly’s new memoir, politically motivated commentary submitted by people who hadn’t been verified to have purchased the book. That situation wouldn’t have been impacted by the new policy given the exception for books and other media.\nThe new cap is part of an ongoing effort by Amazon to weed out fraudulent reviews and ensure the authenticity and reliability of reviews by customers. While Amazon says the vast majority of reviews are authentic, the company previously filed suit against the alleged operators of businesses that sell fake online reviews, as well as merchants who buy them. Amazon also put new restrictions on reviews by people who received free or discounted products.\nAmazon last year also changed the algorithm for displaying reviews and ratings — giving greater weight to newer, more helpful and verified customer reviews (written comments) and ratings (the 5-star system) when determining top reviews to display, and when calculating a product’s overall rating.",
