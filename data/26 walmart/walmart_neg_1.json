      "text": "Hop on over to Amazon or Walmart where you can score this Coleman Sundome 2-Person Tent for just $25 (regularly $63.99). This tent measures 7’X5’x48″, has a center height of 48 inches.\n\nAs another option, Amazon dropped the price on this Coleman Sundome 4 Person Tent down to just $44 (regularly $59). Seems like a great deal seeing as Walmart has this priced at $63.99!\nShipping Options: Amazon: Get free shipping on a $49 order, a $25 Book order OR snag free 2-day shipping on ANY size order with Amazon Prime (you can sign up for a FREE 30-day trial here ). OR, choose free no-rush shipping and get a $5.99 credit for Prime Pantry OR a $1 credit for eBooks & more – may vary by user.\nWalmart: Choose free in-store pick up if available near you; otherwise, shipping is $4.97 or free on orders over $50. Or, score FREE 2-day shipping on ANY size order with Shipping Pass – available to select customers only ( go here to learn more).\n(Thanks, Awesome Deals 365 !) \n\n",

      "text": "Walmart invests in employees with training academy Kayla King-Sumner , The Republic | azcentral.com 8:33 p.m. MST November 14, 2016 The \"Pathways\" program is a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. Rita Adams grins after completing a floor training exercise at a Walmart in Peoria. (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner/The Republic) \nRita Adams has been selling jewelry at a Peoria Walmart for years, and she still arrives to work five days a week with the same radiant smile, resilient attitude and southern chuckle. \n\"This is my career,\" said 52-year-old Adams. \"I raised my family out of it.\" \nAdams started working for Walmart in 1996 in her small Mississippi hometown, and when she moved to Arizona in 1999, she had a job waiting for her. Her career with the nation's largest private employer allowed her to buy a house and send herself and three daughters to college, she said. \nNow, Adams seeks a promotion to jewelry-department manager. She has enrolled in Walmart's \"Pathways\" program, a training initiative aimed at increasing growth opportunities for employees nationwide. \nThe program is part of a $2.7 billion investment in training and wage increases for employees, announced in 2015 as Walmart trailed competitors in customer-service ratings and employee satisfaction. \nWalmart plans to establish 200 Pathways academies across the country before the end of 2017, according to the company. Arizona academies \nLaura Roberts, 36, trains Walmart supervisor Anna Jordan, 21 to be a department manager at Walmart. (Photo: Kayla King-Sumner | The Republic) \nWalmart held its first Arizona academy-training sessions for employees at stores in Gilbert and Mesa in August. The company employs about 35,000 people in the state. \nThe Peoria Walmart where Adams works houses the company's third Arizona academy, serving staffers from more than 20 nearby Walmart stores. \nThe academy includes a newly built classroom and school area in the back of the store where staff members attend eight-hour class sessions. Employees in the academy must attend four days of classroom training before advancing to practical training in the store. \nAdams completed a practical exercise Monday, a mock sale of an engagement ring. Nathan Seals, one of the store's associate department managers, played the customer. Study: Getting a college degree in Arizona pays off \nAcademy students choose from several areas of study, including core leadership, merchandising, operations, technology and customer service. Then they continue on to training specific to the department in which they currently work, such as jewelry or produce. \nLaura Roberts, 36, started working for Walmart 18 years ago. She said her mentors helped her advance as a professional and a leader in the company. \n\"I was kicked out when I was 16,\" said Roberts. \"This is like (my) second family.\" \nNow a department manager, Roberts is training 21-year-old supervisor Anna Jordan in the Peoria academy. \nJordan started working at Walmart immediately after high school to support herself. She said her favorite aspect of academy training is team-building activities to build a friendlier and more efficient staff. McDonald's 'Hiring Day' seeks to fill 3K jobs in Arizona Employees 'empowered' \nWalmart spokeswoman Delia Garcia said leadership is one of the company's most important core values, as laid out out by Walmart CEO Doug McMillon when he announced the investment into employee training and wages last year. \nGarcia said Walmart has cleaner stores and a better-paid staff as a result of the multibillion-dollar move. \n\"We’re seeing that associates are feeling more empowered in their jobs,\" Garcia said. \"Customer experience scores have gone up for the past eight quarters.\" \nWalmart aims to provide academy training for all of its approximately 140,000 employees in the future, Garcia said. \nThe Peoria academy students will have their graduation ceremony at the Walmart on Peoria Avenue. \n\"You can be whatever you want to be,\" said Adams, the longtime employee turned trainee.",

      "text": "You can now get one of the world’s best wines at Walmart for a mere $7.\nLa Moneda Reserva--the award-winning Chilean Malbec wine--is set to arrive at 500 different Walmart stores across the nation. Earlier this year, the Malbec won the \"platinum best in show\" award at the Decanter World Wine Awards, a prestigious wine competition. The cheap wine also beat out 16,000 others in a blind taste test, winning the \"2015 Best Red Single-Varietal Under ?15\" as well.\nJudges reportedly loved the Malbec for its \"freshly crushed black fruit, creamy vanilla yoghurt, and pepper spice,” and also said it “presented an excellent freshness.” According to Walmart, it’s best when paired with barbecued meats, lamb, pork, and dark chocolate. \n \nBefore now, the award-winning wine was exclusively offered at the British supermarket chain Asda, a subsidiary of Walmart wmt , for about $6.29 (?4.37). And since Thrillist reported that the wine promptly sold out at Asda grocery stores after it received the awards, you better act fast: The wine will only be available while supplies last, according to Walmart.",

      "text": "If you're obsessed with wine but stick to affordable bottles because, you know, rent, food, survival, then I have some exciting news! La Moneda Reserva, a fancy AF Chilean Malbec that's won awards for being so delicious, is now available at Walmart for $7. I'll drink (multiple bottles) to that. 🍷🍷🍷.\nThe wine won the award for \"Platinum Best in Show\" at the 2016 Decanter World Wine Awards in June. Previously, it won a blind taste-test — beating out 16,000 other wines — and was named the \"2015 Best Red Single-Varietal Under £15.\" The takeaway: It's delicious, cheap, and wine experts across the world think it's pretty great.\n La Moneda Reserva was originally sold at Walmart's U.K. business, Asda , and it's finally made its way to the United States. It will be available in more than 500 Walmart stores across the country but only while supplies last, so stock up ASAP — like, before Thanksgiving dinner.\nFor more food news and magical recipes, follow Cosmo Bites on Facebook !\nFollow Danielle on Instagram and Twitter .\n ",

      "text": "You don’t have to spend $250 on eBay to get an NES Classic. Have some patience, and try Walmart instead.\nAt 2 p.m. Pacific time today and every day through November 18, Walmart.com will have a quantity of NES Classic Edition systems up for sale. That means you should have your ecommerce finger ready to go within the hour on this page if you want to snag one at the $60 price. The throwback system, which is a miniaturized version of the original 8-bit NES that comes with 30 built-in games, debuted November 11. It sold out almost instantly , and it even caused Amazon and other retailers’ websites to crash. This has led GamesBeat to speculate on our official podcast that Nintendo is purposefully limiting supply to generate buzz.\nBut it looks like second and third shipments are on their way to stores like Walmart, and you should likely have the opportunity to find and purchase one before the holiday gift-giving season.\nThe NES Classic is one of Nintendo’s biggest products this fall. The company doesn’t really have anything for the Wii U, and the 3DS handheld is relying heavily on the Pokémon Sun and Moon games. But it definitely seems like the NES Classic is more than making up for a lack of other major releases. GameStop had lines out the door, and some people spent most of November 11 attempting to track down this nostalgic little box. With thousands of NES Classics up for sale on eBay at prices at around $250 or more, the demand is clearly huge.\nAnd that demand is going to make it so that Walmart’s daily allotment is going to sell out quick, so have your credit card out and ready to go.\n",

      "text": "You can now get one of the world’s best wines at Walmart for a mere $7.\nLa Moneda Reserva—the award-winning Chilean Malbec wine—is set to arrive at 500 different Walmart stores across the nation. Earlier this year, the Malbec won the “platinum best in show” award at the Decanter World Wine Awards, a prestigious wine competition. The cheap wine also beat out 16,000 others in a blind taste test, winning the “2015 Best Red Single-Varietal Under £15” as well.\nJudges reportedly loved the Malbec for its “freshly crushed black fruit, creamy vanilla yoghurt, and pepper spice,” and also said it “presented an excellent freshness.” According to Walmart, it’s best when paired with barbecued meats, lamb, pork, and dark chocolate.\nBefore now, the award-winning wine was exclusively offered at the British supermarket chain Asda, a subsidiary of Walmart wmt , for about $6.29 (£4.37). And since Thrillist reported that the wine promptly sold out at Asda grocery stores after it received the awards, you better act fast: The wine will only be available while supplies last, according to Walmart.",

      "text": "Continue reading the main story But activism against Walmart’s more than 400 stores in China in recent months has followed a different pattern: workers in several cities agitating against the same company, bypassing official unions controlled by the Communist Party and using social media to coordinate their actions — while the authorities largely stand aside. \n  Across China, Walmart employees have raised their fists at protests, chanting, “Workers, stand up!” They have appealed to local officials with patriotic fervor, invoking the struggles of Mao Zedong against foreign imperialists. They have posted screeds online against unkind bosses and “union puppets.” In doing so, the Chinese work force of the world’s largest retail chain has put the ruling Communist Party in an uncomfortable position, publicly testing its Marxist commitment to defend the working class and pitting that against its fear of independent labor activism. Ever since the Solidarity trade union helped topple Communist rule in Poland, Beijing has sought to prevent the emergence of a nationwide labor movement, suppressing efforts by workers to organize across industries or localities. But the authorities appear to be hesitating in the case of Walmart, whose workers have complained of low wages and a new scheduling system they say has left them poorer and exhausted. Photo Zhai Xiuhua, a Walmart employee in Shenzhen, was one of the most vocal leaders in the fight against the company’s new scheduling system. She was fired in September, after her bosses said she had “severely violated” company policies. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times In recent months, as many as 20,000 people, about a fifth of the company’s work force in China, have joined messaging groups set up by Mr. Wang and other activists on WeChat, a popular app . In these forums, they vent about company policies, share protest slogans and discuss plans to coordinate demonstrations for maximum effect. Mr. Wang, a former customer service representative whom Walmart has fired twice, spends his days babysitting his granddaughter and trading messages with workers across the country, often as late as 2 a.m. “What they’re doing is inhumane,” he said. “I want Walmart to return to the sympathetic company it used to be.” Eli Friedman, a labor scholar at Cornell University, said the Walmart movement was “probably the most substantive example of sustained, cross-workplace, independent worker organizing we’ve ever seen in China’s private sector.” \n  The government appears to be keeping a distance because it is worried about provoking a backlash, or about acting on behalf of a prominent American company against Chinese workers at a time when nationalism in China is rising. But by doing little or nothing, it risks encouraging disaffected workers elsewhere, especially at the growing number of national chain businesses with operations across China. Already, workers at Neutrogena stores and China Unicom, a state-owned telecom operator, have used similar tactics, while avoiding serious punishment. “We can only expect that online organizing will continue to break down local barriers,” said Keegan Elmer, a researcher for China Labour Bulletin, an advocacy group based in Hong Kong. The retail sector in particular has become a hotbed of worker activism. The government wants to shift growth from manufacturing to service industries, but many new jobs at restaurants, hotels and stores are low-paying or part-time. From July through September, there were 124 strikes and protests at service-sector firms, about double the number last year, outpacing episodes in manufacturing for the first time since at least 2011, according to China Labour Bulletin. Photo You Tianyu, 45, a Walmart employee in Shenzhen, wrote a letter to the president of the company to complain about working conditions. She said her bosses chastised her for speaking out. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times Chinese law requires businesses to establish labor unions, but they are almost always controlled by management, and companies generally use the unions to contain worker activism. In the face of labor strife, some businesses have offered back pay, bonuses and other benefits to workers. But others, concerned that labor activism could force costly concessions, have resorted to tougher tactics, retaliating against those who help organize protests. At Walmart, some of the most vocal workers have been deprived of raises, reassigned, or in some cases fired, according to interviews with more than a dozen employees. At one store in Zhongshan, west of Shenzhen, a labor activist said a supervisor photographed her in the bathroom as retribution for speaking out. She asked not be identified for fear of further antagonizing her bosses. \n  Much of the discontent stems from a new scheduling system that Walmart put in place this summer as a way, the company said, of giving workers more flexibility. Workers have argued that it has resulted in cuts to overtime pay and excessively long shifts, and some say they were coerced into signing new contracts agreeing to the system. Walmart denied that it had treated its employees unfairly or had pressured them to accept the new schedules. Rebecca Lui, a spokeswoman, said that the vast majority of its work force supported the new system, and that employees were free to keep their old schedules. “Our associates are our most valuable asset,” she said in a statement. Zhai Xiuhua, a former greeter at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, said she was fired in September after leading a fight against the new scheduling system. “I told them, ‘Even if you put a knife to my neck, I’ll never agree,’” she recalled at her home, where her uniform and identification badge — No. 14470 — still hang on the wall. Ms. Zhai, worried about medical bills, says she now hopes to find work in her hometown in the southwestern province of Sichuan. Walmart, which has resisted unionization at its thousands of stores across the world, was forced by the government in 2006 to establish branches of the Communist Party-controlled All-China Federation of Trade Unions for its roughly 100,000 Chinese employees, part of a broader push by the party to unionize foreign businesses. But union branches at many Walmart stores are under the thumb of store managers, and higher-level union officials appear torn about how to respond to complaints from workers like Ms. Zhai. Photo A Walmart in Shenzhen. About 20,000 people, or a fifth of the work force at the company’s 400 stores in China, have joined groups on WeChat, a popular messaging app, to organize against the retailer. Credit Lam Yik Fei for The New York Times While union officials here in Guangdong Province have criticized Walmart for not seeking governmental approval for the new scheduling system, they have not taken more forceful action or helped mobilize workers. Labor activists at Walmart have cited the ideals of President Xi Jinping and the Communist Party’s history of protecting workers, and experts said they appeared to be benefiting from a belief among some officials that the influence of foreign companies such as Walmart should be curtailed. \n  “If the Chinese authorities try to suppress the workers on behalf of Walmart,” said Wang Jiangsong, a Chinese labor scholar, “it will hurt the country’s image.” When Walmart opened its first store in China in 1996, workers rushed to snap up jobs that paid more than those at Chinese competitors. Now, some employees say, a Walmart job does not pay enough to comfortably support a family, with wages hovering around minimum wage, or about $300 a month. While Walmart has led a high-profile campaign in the United States to raise pay, salaries in China have remained largely stagnant, workers said, barely keeping pace with inflation. Walmart has struggled to keep up with the fast-changing tastes of Chinese consumers and tried to re-energize its business by making investments in online retailers. But the continuing labor unrest poses a potential hurdle. You Tianyu, 45, a customer service employee at a Walmart store in Shenzhen, caught the attention of her supervisors in August when she wrote a letter to the president of Walmart, Doug McMillon, to complain about the company’s efforts to silence aggrieved workers. Ms. You said her bosses now harassed her daily because she spoke out, and she has received a diagnosis of anxiety and depression. She spends most of her nonworking hours rummaging through a mess of worker manifestoes, union laws and pay slips in her tiny apartment, hoping to find a new line of attack against Walmart. “I’m on the verge of collapsing,” she said. “I don’t know how much longer I’ll last.” \nOwen Guo contributed research.",

BROWN/AFP/Getty Images) \nCOMPTON (CBSLA.com) — Walmart says a new Compton store opening this winter will need locals to fill as many as 300 new full- and part-time jobs. \nThe retailer has opened a temporary hiring center at 420 S. Long Beach Blvd., Suite 424, next door to O’Reilly Auto Parts, where applications will be accepted Monday through Friday from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. \nApplications will also be accepted at careers.walmart.com . \nNew workers will be needed as soon as December to help prepare the store for its grand opening, store manager Diana Reyes said. \nEligible full- and part-time workers can get benefits including health care, matching 401(k) contributions of up to six percent of pay, discounts, company-paid life insurance and a quarterly cash bonus based on store performance. \nWalmart says 10,000 California workers were promoted from part-time to full-time last year.",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nThe word “normalization” has been thrown around a lot lately, generally in reference to the lamestream media’s attempts to be even-handed in its coverage of people who openly hate it (i.e., Donald Trump and his team). But there’s another, equally insidious means by which extreme beliefs formerly relegated to the lunatic fringe are being woven into the fabric of mainstream society. That’s right— Walmart is now selling Burzum T-shirts . \nIn all fairness, the shirts are being sold through an outside seller, Rockabilia, on Walmart’s website, and aren’t actually available in Walmart stores. (Amazon also sells the exact same shirt , for the record.) Sellers on Walmart’s website are vetted, although it’s not clear how (Walmart’s site says its “verification process is proprietary and confidential”), and considering the shirt doesn’t have “THIS ARTIST HAS MADE SOME WORRYING STATEMENTS ABOUT JEWS” printed on it in bold letters, it’s possible that Walmart’s secret marketplace tribunal has no idea who the hell Burzum is and what he stands for. \nThen again, this is an Arkansas-based corporation operating in the year 2016, when the quintessentially Burzum-esque pastimes of hate crimes and church burnings are on the rise. Maybe Walmart knows exactly what it’s doing after all. \nThanks to reader Patrick Folz for the tip. \nSend your Newswire tips to",

      "text": "Walmart tries using blockchain to take unsafe food off shelves It could pull bacteria-laden produce before you have a chance to buy it. Save AP Photo/Danny Johnston \nIt's scary when stores have to pull unsafe food . It can take days to pinpoint the batch or supplier that caused the problem, which could lead to people getting sick... or at best, force the store to yank more products than necessary. Walmart believes technology could offer a better way. It's trying out blockchain's distributed ledger as a means of identifying the sources of poisonous food. Digital receipts for the food identify everyone in the supply chain, ranging from the original location through to the inspectors and shipping companies. If everything passing through a specific warehouse is making people ill, Walmart can identify that troublesome food and yank it within minutes -- and there's no easy way for unscrupulous suppliers to alter the info. \nIt's a modest test run at the moment. Walmart is only using blockchain to track both pork in China and a \"packaged produced item\" in the US. Provided the trial run goes smoothly, though, you'll see the tech used for more items. \nWalmart isn't conducting this experiment purely out of concern for customer safety, as you might guess -- this is a company at once famous and notorious for its cost-cutting measures. Blockchain could keep more products on sale in the event of a bacterial outbreak, and refine the supply chain by identifying recurring safety issues or slowdowns. All told, the big-box store could save money even as it saves you from a trip to the hospital.",

      "text": "AP November 21, 2016, 8:23 AM At Walmart, Cyber Monday comes on Friday Stumble \nNEW YORK - Cyber Monday is starting earlier and earlier. \nWalmart ( WMT ) said Monday it’s kicking off its so-called “Cyber Monday” deals at 12:01 a.m. EST Friday for the first time ever as it aims to grab customers ahead of its competitors. \nLast year, the world’s largest retailer pulled up the “Cyber Monday” deals to the Sunday evening after Thanksgiving for the first time. \nCyber Monday, which falls on the Monday after Thanksgiving, is typically the busiest day of the year for online shopping. The phrase was coined in 2005 by the National Retail Federation’s online arm, Shop.org, to encourage online buying when people returned to offices where they had high-speed Internet connections. \nSince then, the proliferation of smartphones has given shoppers constant web access, and now retailers are using Cyber Monday to pull in shoppers hungry for deals continually. \nThe push to start Cyber Monday deals earlier follows what has been happening with Black Friday, the day after Thanksgiving, which used to officially kick off the holiday shopping season in stores. Over the past few years, retailers such as Walmart, Macy’s ( M ) and Target ( TGT ) have started the deals earlier into Thanksgiving. And they’re now offering many of the same deals online as they do in stores on Thanksgiving. \nThis year, Walmart, based in Bentonville, Arkansas, is making Thanksgiving deals available online at 12:01 a.m. EST on the holiday, three hours earlier than last year. Walmart is starting its deals at its stores at 6 p.m. on the turkey feast, the same time as last year. \nRavi Jariwala, a Walmart spokesman, told The Associated Press that three out of the four customers it polled said that they wanted to shop Cyber Monday deals earlier -- after the kickoff in stores. \nThe move comes as Walmart aims to compete more aggressively with online leader Amazon ( AMZN ). Walmart reported last week that its online sales growth accelerated to 20.6 percent in the third quarter from its 11.8 percent pace in the prior quarter. Its online business has been helped in part by its growth in product assortment. It now offers 23 million products online, nearly triple from last year’s holiday shopping season. \nComScore predicts online spending on Cyber Monday will jump to $3.5 billion from $3.12 billion last year. \nThe firm’s preliminary holiday season shopping forecast is for online sales to rise as much as 19 percent to $81 billion. \nAside from a dip the day after the contentious presidential election , there are no signs that shoppers’ appetite for spending has been seriously weakened, said comScore analyst Andrew Lipsman. Another firm, Adobe Digital Insights, forecasts online sales will be up 11 percent to $91.6 billion this holiday season. © 2016 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

Reuters \nWalmart is kicking off its Cyber Monday deals three days early on Black Friday. \nAfter launching Black Friday discounts online on Thanksgiving, the retailer will release a fresh batch of online deals at 12:01 a.m. ET on Friday, November 25. \nInstead of referring to the second event as Cyber Monday, Walmart is calling it \"cyber week,\" since the deals will be available for a week starting Friday. (Walmart will also launch yet another round of deals on Cyber Monday). \nThe retailer is launching cyber week deals earlier to showcase its newly expanded online offering. \nThe company has nearly tripled its online assortment to 23 million products from 8 million last year in an effort to catch up to Amazon, which sells more than 353 million products (12 million directly and the rest from marketplace sellers, according to 360pi ). \nAs a result, Walmart.com now carries many items that shoppers wouldn't be able to find in a Walmart store, including products from brands like Michael Kors, Ray-Ban, and UGG. \nTo prevent customers from getting overwhelmed by all the new products, Walmart made improvements to its \"recommendation engine,\" which so far has led to a 20% increase in customer engagement with items the website recommends. \nIt has also built a new software called Electrode that helps its web pages load 33% faster, according to Walmart. \nHere are some of the cyber week deals that shoppers will be able to take advantage of starting Friday: Samsung 60\" 1080p HD Smart LED TV for $579 with $80 Walmart Gift Card ($1,120 savings)",

      "text": "Apps & Games News by John Callaham 4 seconds ago \nThere’s Android Pay , Samsung Pay and even Walmart Pay for Android users to choose from for their mobile payment needs. Now the U.S. bank Chase is entering this already crowded field with its own Chase Pay app and system. See also: Android Pay vs Apple Pay vs Samsung Pay Overview April 27, 2016 \nIn a press release, Chase says that the app is currently only supported in Starbucks and Best Buy retail locations in the US. People who own a Chase credit, debit or “Liquid” card can store it in the app and use old fashioned QR codes to pay for items at those two retailers, with Touch ID support coming in a future update. Chase Pay will expand to other retailers in the future, including ironically Walmart, along select Shell gas stations soon, along with Phillips 66, Conoco, 76, ShopRite , and The Fresh Grocer. The Chase Pay app can also be used to check account balances and available credit and view transactions from the last 90 days. \nThe launch of Chase Pay at this time, and with so few retailers supporting it, is a bit odd as both Android Pay and Samsung Pay are already well established in the US, and both are adding more and more new banks and services all the time. It would seem that Chase was extremely slow to get its own mobile payment service out of the gate, and it will be a struggle for it to compete with all the other ones that are already serving millions of customers a day.

Share WYSIWYG \nGovernor Andrew M. Cuomo today announced that New York State is partnering with Walmart, Wegmans, FreshDirect and The Coca-Cola Company this Thanksgiving Week to help deliver meals to feed more than 35,000 people statewide. \"Thanksgiving provides the opportunity both to reflect on what we are grateful for and to give back to our fellow New Yorkers,\" Governor Cuomo said. \"This partnership will provide families throughout the state with a warm meal to enjoy with loved ones. This week and throughout the holiday season, I encourage all New Yorkers to reach out to their neighbors and find ways to pitch in and help those in need.\" Thanks to generous food donations from Walmart and Wegmans, meals are being assembled and packaged to feed over 35,000 New Yorkers statewide. Each meal includes turkey, stuffing, pumpkin pie, vegetables, cranberry sauce and potatoes. Additionally, The Coca-Cola Company donated over 3,000 beverages, including juice and other drinks, to be distributed with the meals. FreshDirect has provided thousands of boxes to ensure the meals are properly packaged and delivered. Walmart and the Walmart Foundation's collaboration with Governor Cuomo and the State of New York this Thanksgiving is part of its overall commitment to assist communities and families throughout the state. Today's donation of thousands of meals adds to the more than 7.5 million meals the company has donated in New York State so far this fiscal year. Jason Klipa, Director of Public Affairs for Walmart in New York, said, \"There are far too many people in our country that go to bed hungry or unsure where their next meal is coming from. As the nation’s largest grocer, we’re strongly committed to being a part of the solution in the fight against hunger in New York and across the nation. We’re grateful for the opportunity to be involved in events like today as part of our goal to help provide meals to those that don’t have enough to eat.\" Francis McGorry, President, Tri-State Metro, Coca-Cola Refreshments, said, \"Coca-Cola has a long standing history of helping communities during times of need and the holiday season. On behalf of our 3,500 Coca-Cola associates in New York, we thank Governor Cuomo for his leadership in helping families in need throughout the holiday season.\" Wegmans Food Markets, Inc. CEO Danny Wegman said, \"We are committed to supporting hunger relief efforts throughout the year. This time of year provides a wonderful opportunity to give back to our communities and help ensure families have a warm meal. We are proud to partner with Governor Cuomo on this important work.\" Jason Ackerman, Co-Founder and CEO of FreshDirect, said , \"FreshDirect is proud to partner with Governor Cuomo on this effort to provide a warm meal to New Yorkers in need. Thanksgiving is the perfect time of year to give back, and we encourage everyone to find a way to help friends and neighbors during the holiday season.\" \nNext Section Contact the Governor's Press Office Contact the Governor's Press Office Contact us by phone:",

      "text": "Skin gels said to contain aloe vera at Walmart, Target, and CVS were found to have no evidence of the plant, according to a Bloomberg News investigation . The store-brand products were tested in a lab for aloe’s chemical markers; the chemicals were absent, indicating that no actual aloe plant is in the skin gels.\nAloe vera is a plant that’s been used for medicinal purposes for thousands of years . Today, aloe is used in products purporting to treat skin burns and cold sores, as well as constipation, although there’s no conclusive evidence aloe vera helps for most of these things. (There’s some evidence it’s a laxative!) The US market for products that say they contain aloe accounts for $146 million, an 11 percent increase in the past year, Bloomberg News reports. The US Food and Drug Administration, however, doesn’t approve cosmetic products before they’re sold, so the agency doesn’t check whether claims on packaging are accurate. \nSeveral law firms have filed lawsuits The aloe gel samples analyzed by Bloomberg News all listed aloe leaf juice as their main ingredient, or the main one after water. However, when they were tested for the plant’s three chemical markers — acemannan, malic acid, and glucose — the products were found to have no evidence of aloe. None of the samples contained lactic acid, either, which would indicate degraded aloe vera. Instead, they contained maltodextrin, a sugar used as a food additive that is sometimes used to imitate aloe and is much cheaper. ( Bloomberg News also analyzed an aloe gel from Walgreens; it contained one aloe marker, meaning that the plant’s presence can’t be confirmed or ruled out.) \nSeveral law firms have filed lawsuits against Walmart, Target, CVS, and Walgreens, after separate tests also found that no aloe is present in the retailers’ store-brand gels. “No reasonable person would have purchased or used the products if they knew the products did not contain any aloe vera,’’ attorneys wrote in a complaint filed in September, according to Bloomberg News .\nTarget declined to comment, while Walmart Stores Inc., CVS Health Corp., and Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc. all told the news organization that their suppliers had told them their products were authentic. The products Bloomberg tested are Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.",

      "text": "If you use Aloe Vera gel from Walmart , CVS , or Target , you might be soothing burns with sugar rather than extract from a plant.\nMultiple lab tests of store-brand aloe gel from Walmart, Target, and CVS showed no traces of aloe vera, even though aloe vera juice is listed as the first or second ingredient in every case, according to an in-depth report Bloomberg published Tuesday. Instead, the samples included a cheaper additive, maltodextrin, which is essentially a sugar made from starch. It’s often used as an aloe substitute, and can also be found in Jello and Splenda.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test four gels: Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\nResults showed that the three chemical markers for aloe were absent in Walmart, CVS, and Target’s samples. The Walgreens sample included just one of the markers, suggesting that the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out.\n \nFort Worth, Texas-based Fruit of the Earth made the gels for Walgreens, Walmart, and Target. Daytona Beach, Fla.-based Product Quest Manufacturing made CVS’s aloe gel. Fruit of the Earth disputed Bloomberg’s findings, while Product Quest declined to comment to Bloomberg.\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they are sold to consumers, which would allow an aloe-less aloe gel onto shelves without being stopped.\n“We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality of products they expect,” a Walmart representative told Fortune . “We contacted our suppliers and they stand behind the authenticity of their products.”\n“The quality, safety and integrity of our products is of highest priority to us, and we carefully select suppliers who share those priorities as well,” Walgreens said in a statement. ” Our supplier has assured us that the product's ingredients match its labeling.”\nTarget declined to comment to Fortune . We’ve reached out to CVS, Fruit of the Earth, and Product Quest for comment as well, and will update when they respond.",

Business Insider has affiliate partnerships so we get a share of the revenue from your purchase. \nKevin Brine/ ShutterStock \nThis year, Walmart is testing out a new Black Friday and Cyber Monday strategy in an effort to make its deals more accessible to online shoppers than ever before. \nI nstead of releasing its online sales on Cyber Monday, Walmart is launching its Black Friday deals on Thanksgiving and a new batch of deals the following day. (Walmart will also launch yet another round of deals on Cyber Monday.) \nThe company has nearly tripled its online assortment, from 8 million products last year to 23 million products, in an effort to catch up to Amazon, which carries more than 353 million products — 12 million directly and the rest from marketplace sellers, according to 360pi . \nAs a result, Walmart.com now carries many items that shoppers wouldn't be able to find in a Walmart store, including products from brands like Michael Kors, Ray-Ban, and UGG. \nWe also have guides specifically to hit certain budgets, so if you're looking for a great tech gift for under $100, or a great gift from any category for under $50, we have you covered. \nOur guides even cover some good do's and don'ts for holiday shopping and some gift ideas for people who might be harder to shop for, like your coworkers or your father-in-law . \nIf you're looking for the best deals on Walmart right now, keep refreshing this page. We'll be making sure those deals are on this list. \nThis story is developing. Bookmark this page and stay tuned for Insider Pick's Black Friday coverage on November 25, 2016.

And now, this. \nA new Bloomberg News report raises doubts about store-brand aloe vera after tests it commissioned on products bought at Walmart, CVS and Target reportedly found no trace of their claimed prime ingredient ― aloe barbadensis leaf juice. \nInstead, the products were said to have contained cheaper maltodextrin , a sugar used as a food additive that Bloomberg said can imitate aloe. \nThree gels identified as failing Bloomberg’s tests are Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; and Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera. kaanates via Getty Images Aloe offers a wealth of health benefits, with it containing vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes and fatty acids, and minerals. \nWalgreens’ Alcohol-Free Aloe Vera Body Gel was reportedly found to contain one of aloe’s three chemical makers, malic acid. Acemannan and glucose were not found, which Bloomberg said means the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out. \nThe report comes months after a class-action lawsuit was filed against the Texas-based company that manufactures aloe products for Walgreens, Walmart and Target. That company, Fruit of the Earth, responded to Bloomberg’s article by calling it utterly false. \nThe company argued in a statement to The Huffington Post that acemannan doesn’t equate to aloe, but said its tests nevertheless show Fruit of the Earth products do contain the chemical maker. The company said it would share its test results in the class-action litigation. \n“The true test of whether the product contains aloe is to trace the aloe ingredient from the aloe leaves, through processing, and to the manufacturer’s use of the aloe ingredient in the finished product,” the company said. \nAs for the presence of maltodextrin, Fruit of the Earth said a production step “uses maltodextrin to aid in the spray drying process.” \nWalmart and CVS appear to be taking their supplier’s word. A Walmart spokesman said in an email to HuffPost that the retailer would continue to sell the product. A spokeswoman for Target declined comment, citing the litigation. \nAloe vera, which contains vitamins, anti-inflammatory enzymes, fatty acids and minerals, has a range of health benefits. Acemannan has shown anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, and appears to promote cell growth, studies have shown.

      "text": "If you use Aloe Vera gel from Walmart , CVS , or Target , you might be soothing burns with sugar rather than extract from a plant.\nMultiple lab tests of store-brand aloe gel from Walmart, Target, and CVS showed no traces of aloe vera, even though aloe vera juice is listed as the first or second ingredient in every case, according to an in-depth report Bloomberg published Tuesday. Instead, the samples included a cheaper additive, maltodextrin, which is essentially a sugar made from starch. It’s often used as an aloe substitute, and can also be found in Jello and Splenda.\nBloomberg hired a lab to test four gels: Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS’ Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; and Walgreens Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel.\nResults showed that the three chemical markers for aloe were absent in Walmart, CVS, and Target’s samples. The Walgreens sample included just one of the markers, suggesting that the presence of aloe could neither be confirmed nor ruled out.\nFort Worth, Texas-based Fruit of the Earth made the gels for Walgreens, Walmart, and Target. Daytona Beach, Fla.-based Product Quest Manufacturing made CVS’s aloe gel. Fruit of the Earth disputed Bloomberg’s findings, while Product Quest declined to comment to Bloomberg.\nThe Food and Drug Administration doesn’t approve cosmetics before they are sold to consumers, which would allow an aloe-less aloe gel onto shelves without being stopped.\n“We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality of products they expect,” a Walmart representative told Fortune . “We contacted our suppliers and they stand behind the authenticity of their products.”\n“The quality, safety and integrity of our products is of highest priority to us, and we carefully select suppliers who share those priorities as well,” Walgreens said in a statement. ” Our supplier has assured us that the product’s ingredients match its labeling.”\nTarget declined to comment to Fortune . We’ve reached out to CVS, Fruit of the Earth, and Product Quest for comment as well, and will update when they respond.",

      "text": "After 20 years of working for the company, a Missouri man was fired from Wal-Mart, leaving his community outraged.\nFrank Swanson, 56, was just 20 days short of working a full 20 years at the West Plains Wal-Mart when he was fired. \nFrank's brother, Drexel Swanson, says his brother's ultimate goal in life is to \"make other people feel good about themselves and to bring a smile to their face,\" after he was left disabled from an accident as a child, Attn: reports.\nEvery day at work, Frank hugged customers who accepted his offer. Management at the store had warned Frank about hugging customers, calling it \"gross.\" He assured his managers he was respectful of customers' personal space.\n\"I was asking the ladies if I could give them hugs before I hugged them, \" Frank told Attn:. \"They said yes.\"\nFrank also tried to make customers' days better by memorizing competitors' weekly ads to price-match to help them save money, which Wal-Mart advocates.\nWhen a customer purchasing a single iced tea said she saw a lower price from a competitor, Frank gave her the small discount, saving her 50 cents, according to Attn:.\n\"I was checking out a lady who had some iced tea,\" Frank said. \"Someone had it on sale in town.\"\nBecause the customer did not have the ad she was referring to on hand, the West Plains Wal-Mart considered the 50 cent discount Frank gave the customer to be theft. \nFrank did everything he could to prove to his managers that the price he rang up was correct, but they didn't listen and he was fired from his job, according to Mad World News.\n\"My brother doesn’t have a mean bone in his body,\" Drexel Swanson said. \"He loves to hug people, especially the older generation. He says they don’t get enough hugs in their life. That’s Frank Swanson, my brother, and I am proud to call him my brother.\"\n",

(NBC/Peter Kramer/NBC) NEW YORK DAILY NEWS   11:04 AM \nWalmart is getting its money back after settling a multi-million dollar lawsuit with comedian Tracy Morgan. \nThe superstore paid Morgan and the family of his pal James (uncle Jimmy Mack) McNair — who died in the 2014 crash involving one of its trucks — an undisclosed amount in the millions, but has now received a considerable amount back from its insurance company, TMZ reports . \nWalmart and XL Insurance America recently struck a deal, despite the insurance company's initial choice to turn down the claim. McNair's family was offered $10 million from the company, but it is unclear how much Morgan — who was seriously injured in the crash — had actually received. The Walmart truck involved in the crash of the limousine bus carrying Tracy Morgan and six other people is seen early Saturday morning June 7, 2014 on the New Jersey Turnpike at the accident scene. (Will Vaultz/AP) \nFellow comedian Damon Wayans once said the former \"Saturday Night Live\" cast member settled at $90 million, but Morgan's reps denied the number. \nTracy Morgan's doctor: He will never fully be himself again \nMorgan and his friends were traveling on the New Jersey Turnpike returning from a performance when Walmart driver Kevin Roper crashed his big rig truck into the celebrity's Mercedes limo van, causing it to flip on its side and crash into other vehicles. James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair was killed in a limo vs. tractor traiiler accident in on the New Jersey Turnpike in which actor/comedian Tracy Morgan was injured. \nThe \"30 Rock\" star spent two weeks in a coma after the accident and suffered numerous broken bones and broken ribs in the crash. He had a long arduous recovery over the past two years, only recently being able to perform again. \nRoper, 35, pleaded not guilty to charges of vehicular manslaughter in February after a criminal complaint stated he had not slept for more than 24 hours before the tragic crash. He is currently out on $50,000 bail. Join the Conversation:",

      "text": "11/23/16 AT 11:08 AM Close \nThanksgiving is the beginning of the holiday season, and many want to get started on their holiday shopping right away. Stores seem more than happy to let customers in before Black Friday even starts. Many stores will be open on Thanksgiving. \nOf course, not all stores are following this trend. Office Max, hhgregg, Radio Shack and Office Depot were on this list last year, but they’ve decided to close on Thanksgiving in 2016. Barnes & Noble, Ikea, PetSmart, Costco and Staples will continue to hold their sales for Black Friday as well. \nStores that decide to open are mostly starting to unlock the doors in the early evening or late afternoon. Keep in mind that the list below won’t be exact for every area. Some franchise owners will change their hours, and some won’t open at all. Blue laws prevent Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Maine locations from being open on Thanksgiving Day, so remember to check your local store’s hours before heading out. \nBelk : 4 p.m. [ store locator ] \nBest Buy : 5 p.m. to 1 a.m. [ store locator ] \nBig Lots : 7 a.m. to midnight [ store locator ] \nBon-Ton : 5 p.m. to midnight [ store locator ] \nCVS : open, but hours vary [ store locator ] \nDick’s Sporting Goods : 6 p.m. to midnight [ store locator ] \nDollar General : 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. [ store locator ] \nExpress : 6 p.m. [ store locator ] \nFive Below : 6 p.m. to 1 a.m. [ store locator ] \nGander Mountain : 8 a.m. to midnight [ store locator ]",

Story continues below \nAccording to the news agency, the lab results show Walmart’s Equate Aloe After Sun Gel with pure aloe vera; Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel with pure aloe vera; CVS Aftersun Aloe Vera Moisturizing Gel, did not contain evidence of the key ingredient of aloe vera even though the products list aloe barbadensis leaf juice (AKA aloe vera) as the number one or number two ingredient after water. \nGlobal News has not independently tested these products. \nBloomberg said the three main chemical markers of aloe; acemannan, malic acid and glucose, were absent from the sample tests of the gels sold at CVS and Target. Walmart’s gel, which is sold in Canada , also had no traces of the three chemicals. \nWalmart Canada did not respond to Global News when asked for comment on the Bloomberg report. A Walmart spokesperson in the U.S. told Fortune magazine the retailer stands behind its product. \n“We hold our suppliers to high standards and are committed to providing our customers the quality of products they expect,” the magazine quoted the Walmart rep as saying. “We contacted our suppliers and they stand behind the authenticity of their products.” \nCiting stats from market researcher SPINS LLC, Bloomberg reported the aloe product market racked in over $145 million U.S. in 2016, an 11 per cent increase over the course of the year. \nThe lab tests showed a presence of an aloe imitator dubbed maltodextrin, a sugar often used in place of aloe, in the Walmart, CVS and Target sample tests, according to Bloomberg’s report. \nHowever, Bloomberg noted that one of the four products, Walgreens’ Alcohol Free Aloe Vera Body Gel, contained one of the three key chemical markers of aloe and couldn’t confirm or rule out the presence of the plant. \nREAD MORE: Homeopathic drugs must carry labels telling consumers there’s no proof products work, U.S. government says \nA spokesperson for Walgreens Boots Alliance told Global News the retailer’s supplier “has assured us that the product’s ingredients match its labeling.” \n“The quality, safety and integrity of our products is of highest priority to us, and we carefully select suppliers who share those priorities as well,” James W. Graham said in an email. \nCiting pending litigation, Target spokesperson Erika Winkels declined to comment any further to Global News. The retailer is the subject of a class-action lawsuit filed in California claiming Target’s Up & Up Aloe Vera Gel contains no aloe. Target has denied the claims made in the lawsuit. \nAs the Consumerist points out, cosmetics sold in American retail stores do not need to be approved by U.S. Food & Drug Administration, and it’s on the suppliers to own up to what is labelled on their products. \n“The law does not require cosmetic products and ingredients, other than color additives, to have FDA approval before they go on the market, but there are laws and regulations that apply to cosmetics on the market in interstate commerce,” reads a message on the FDA website . \nTexas-based Fruit of the Earth, the maker of Walmart, Target and Walgreens’ aloe gel, disputed Bloomberg’s findings . \n“We’ve been in the business a long time and we know where the raw ingredients come from,’’ John Dondrea told Bloomberg. “We stand behind our products.’’ \nFruit of the Earth’s aloe supplier Concentrated Aloe Corp., based in Florida, said the test results are unreliable because of the presence of multiple ingredients interferes with the results. \n“Acemannan has been misinterpreted,” Meadows told Bloomberg . “The cosmetics industry requires highly processed aloe. How that affects acemannan is anybody’s guess.’’ \nCVS did not respond to Global News’ request for comment on its product. © 2016 Global News, a division of Corus Entertainment Inc. ",

      "text": "Walmart intentionally failed to pay hundreds of truck drivers in California the minimum wage, a federal jury decided Wednesday, awarding the drivers $54m in damages and opening up the retail giant to penalties.\nThe seven jurors returned the verdict in a lawsuit accusing the company of not properly paying drivers in accordance with California law for activities that included inspecting and washing their trucks and for layovers. Civil penalties will be determined by a judge. \nThe company argued that the drivers were paid for activities that include those tasks and that they were not working during layovers. A lawyer for Walmart didn’t immediately return calls seeking comment on the verdict. \nThose luxury Egyptian cotton sheets you own may not be luxurious – or Egyptian Read more \nAttorneys for the more than 800 drivers who worked for Walmart between October 2005 and October 2015 were seeking $72m in damages, the bulk of it for layovers. They said during the trial that additional damages and penalties could push the total amount Walmart owed to more than $150m. \nArkansas-based Walmart Stores Inc, the nation’s largest private employer, has faced other criticism over its pay and treatment of US employees. \nThe company announced last year that it was giving a raise to about a half-million US workers. The raises were part of a $1bn investment that the retailer said was also intended to give workers more opportunities to advance and more consistent schedules. \nWalmart drivers are not paid by the hour. Wages are based on mileage and specified activities. \nThe drivers’ attorneys pointed to a ruling in their favor from US district judge Susan Illston, who said last year that Walmart would be in violation of California law if it enforced its driver pay manuals because they say no pay is earned for certain tasks. \n“There’s nothing in any of those three manuals that covered 10 years of time that show the drivers were paid for any of these tasks that are on your verdict form,” attorney Butch Wagner said during closing arguments. \nDrivers were also not paid minimum wage for layovers even though Walmart controlled their time by requiring them to stay with their trucks, the plaintiffs’ attorneys said. \nThe company argued that it paid drivers for activities that included other, smaller tasks and could not have a separate payment designation for everything they did, some of which took just minutes. \nWalmart attorney Scott Edelman likened what the plaintiffs were asking for to a baker who charges a flat fee for a cake, not the individual tasks of buying the eggs, putting the cake in the oven or cleaning the dishes after. \n“When you pay a baker $20 to bake a cake, what are you paying that baker to do?” Walmart attorney Scott Edelman said during his closing argument. “Is it just to put the cake in the oven for however long? Because that’s essentially what the plaintiffs are arguing.” \nWalmart pays drivers $42 for 10-hour overnight layovers as an extra benefit, but it does not control their time during that period, Edelman said. Drivers are free to go to the movies, exercise or do other activities, he said. \nThe company has said its drivers are among the best-paid in the industry, with some making more than $100,000 a year.",

      "text": "A California federal jury on Wednesday handed down a $55 million verdict against Walmart wmt Stores Inc for failing to pay about 850 of its truck drivers all of the compensation to which they were entitled.\nThe jury held that Walmart owed the drivers backpay for conducting pre- and post-trip inspections, mandatory rest breaks and layovers between trips, but not for other tasks, such as fueling and washing trucks.\nCurrent and former Walmart truck drivers in California sued the company in 2008, claiming a plan that compensated drivers by mileage and activity rather than hours worked violated state law. Walmart dropped the plan in 2015.\nU.S. District Judge Susan Illston in San Francisco previously ruled that Walmart violated California law for not paying its truck drivers minimum wage for all work performed. Illston left the determination of damages for trial.\nIllston could double the jury award if she finds that Walmart acted willfully.\nFor more on Walmart, watch Fortune’s video:\nWalmart spokesman Randy Hargrove said the company disagrees with the verdict.\n“We strongly believe that our truck drivers are paid in compliance with California law and often in excess of what California law requires,” Hargrove said, noting that its drivers’ average earnings range from $80,000 to more than $100,000 per year.\nHe said the company will be filing post-trial motions and is likely to appeal the verdict.\nAn attorney for the plaintiffs did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",

      "title": "American Stores Are Far From Overwhelmed as Black Friday Sales Begin",
      "text": "Faith Ruggieri, standing in the damp and chilly night air outside a Walmart in Providence, Rhode Island on Black Friday, represented a hopeful sign for traditional retailers squeezed by online rivals such as Amazon amzn .\nThe mother of two hoped to buy Pyrex dishes for her 20-year old daughter, who is about to move into her first apartment.\nSure, she says, she could have bought online. But brick-and-mortar retailers offer instant gratification, making it worth her while to turn out at 1 a.m. along with hundreds of other shoppers to look for bargains.\nStill, the store was not overwhelmed after the doors opened--a scene replicated across the country on what used to be the biggest shopping day of the year.\nTracy Watkins, a Bed, Bath and Beyond bbby store manager at the Chicago Ridge Mall, said “nobody was busting down the doors at 6 a.m.” as the temperature lurked below freezing.\nThe popularity of Black Friday has been on the wane over the past couple of years as more stores open earlier--even on Thanksgiving--and online retailers offer Black Friday-type deals year-round.\n“It used to be very busy but for the past two years the mornings are not very crazy,” said Gina Reynolds, a 39-year old housewife, shopping at a Macy’s m store in the Water Tower Place Mall in Chicago.\nCrowds were also relatively thin at other stores in the mall, including J.C. Penney jcp and Abercrombie & Fitch anf .\n \nThe holiday shopping season, which traditionally and unofficially begins on the day after Thanksgiving, can account for about as much as 40% of retailers’ annual sales.\nThe National Retail Federation, which has been overly optimistic with projections in the past, has said it expects sales this holiday season to increase by 3.6% to about $656 billion, mainly due to a rise in online shopping.",

      "text": "SEE IT: Brothers arrested for driving dirt bike through Walmart in cape and underwear Brothers arrested for driving dirt bike in Walmart in underwear  39 AM \nIt's a bird, it's a plane, it's an idiot. \nBrothers Justin and Howard Bell were arrested this week after posting video of themselves racing a dirt bike through an Alexandria, Ky., Walmart while wearing nothing but a helmet, cape and white underpants. A GoPro camera attached to his helmet, Justin Bell, 27, sped through a local Walmart while his brother Howard Bell, 44, filmed the randy race. (MediaPress) \nSince no one from the store called police to report the bare brothers barreling through the Walmart, authorities only learned of the crime because the Bells posted it to YouTube, WCPO TV reports. \nThe video of the nearly nude Justin Bell driving through the grocery entrance, swerving around the automotive section and exiting via the lawn and garden area was reportedly taken down Tuesday — the same day they were arrested for felony wanton endangerment. \nJoe Biden’s imagined pranks on President-elect Trump go viral \n\"There are all these side aisles right through here,\" Sgt. Natalie Selby told WCPO. \"I mean, if anybody would've walked through there or pushed a stroller or whatever, I mean, he could've hit 'em.\" Of Justin and Howard Bell’s store aisle stunt, Sgt. Natalie Selby, “The potential for someone getting hurt is really high when you’re acting like that.” (Police Handout) \nPrevious video topics on the brothers' YouTube page include peeing on a Tazer, peeing on a bug zapper and trying to fit 100 condoms over a foot. \nThe Bells have since been released on $50,000 bail, with a preliminary hearing set for Dec. 1.

      "text": "print \nA customer uses Walmart's app during Walmart's Black Friday event in Bentonville, Arkansas. Gunnar Rathbun/AP Images for Walmart \nBlack Friday online sales are slated to hit an all-time high of more than $3 billion this year, representing 11.3% growth over last year, according to Adobe Digital Insights. \nAdobe is basing its forecast on early results from the shopping holiday, which show that it brought in roughly $490 million in the first 8.5 hours of the 24-hour event. \nTop selling electronics so far include iPads, Samsung 4K TVs, and LG TVs, according to Adobe. Best-selling toys include drones, mini vehicles for kids, and Lego sets. \nAdobe's data also shows that people are shopping more than ever before from their smartphones. About 60% of site traffic and 40% of purchases are coming from mobile phones so far, Adobe said. \nThe surge in online sales this year has led Cowen & Co. analysts to re-brand Black Friday as \"couch Friday\" since so many people are shopping without leaving home. \nCowen & Co. expects shopper foot traffic in stores to fall 3.4% on Friday. \n\"We still expect negative traffic given earlier start this year of the holiday selling season and rise of mobile, which could be as much as 60% or more of all traffic, and consumer exhaustion from a saturated promotional environment,\" the analysts wrote in a note published Friday. \nThanksgiving Day online sales totaled $1.93 billion, which is slightly lower than expected but still represents 11.5% growth over last year. \nAdobe attributed the slower growth on Thanksgiving to the start of Black Friday promotions before Thanksgiving by retailers like Target and Walmart. \nOnline sales on November 23 — the day before Thanksgiving — soared 19% to $1.57 billion. \nCheck out the rest of our Black Friday coverage from the Insider Picks team. We're covering the best tech deals around the web , deals over at Amazon , deals at Target , Walmart and Macy's . \nBIQ Podcast: Black Friday is becoming a battle of values vs. values. Some stores open early with doorbuster deals; others are closing and advertising a commitment to family. Listen:",

      "text": "Faith Ruggieri, standing in the damp and chilly night air outside a Walmart in Providence, Rhode Island on Black Friday, represented a hopeful sign for traditional retailers squeezed by online rivals such as Amazon amzn .\nThe mother of two hoped to buy Pyrex dishes for her 20-year old daughter, who is about to move into her first apartment.\nSure, she says, she could have bought online. But brick-and-mortar retailers offer instant gratification, making it worth her while to turn out at 1 a.m. along with hundreds of other shoppers to look for bargains.\nStill, the store was not overwhelmed after the doors opened—a scene replicated across the country on what used to be the biggest shopping day of the year.\nTracy Watkins, a Bed, Bath and Beyond bbby store manager at the Chicago Ridge Mall, said “nobody was busting down the doors at 6 a.m.” as the temperature lurked below freezing.\nThe popularity of Black Friday has been on the wane over the past couple of years as more stores open earlier—even on Thanksgiving—and online retailers offer Black Friday-type deals year-round.\n“It used to be very busy but for the past two years the mornings are not very crazy,” said Gina Reynolds, a 39-year old housewife, shopping at a Macy’s m store in the Water Tower Place Mall in Chicago.\nCrowds were also relatively thin at other stores in the mall, including J.C. Penney jcp and Abercrombie & Fitch anf .\nThe holiday shopping season, which traditionally and unofficially begins on the day after Thanksgiving, can account for about as much as 40% of retailers’ annual sales.\nThe National Retail Federation, which has been overly optimistic with projections in the past, has said it expects sales this holiday season to increase by 3.6% to about $656 billion, mainly due to a rise in online shopping.",

      "text": "Charlotte Allen—Alamy Stock Photo Get your discount codes here. \nUp to 122 million Americans plan on doing some Cyber Monday shopping, according to the National Retail Federation . If the projections hold up, it will be a record high. \nSo how are the prices? Well, like every Cyber Monday , there are always some truly compelling bargains. Amazon continues to offer some of the special deals introduced last week for Black Friday, like the Fire tablet for only $33.33 (normally $50). There are also new short-lived promotions rolling out regularly just for Cyber Monday . Likewise, Walmart is promoting a range of impressive Cyber Monday deals, like a 32-inch Samsung 4000 Series LED TV for $148 (normally $420) and up to $210 off trampolines. \nWhile these deals tend to be hit or miss, what makes Cyber Monday wonderful for shoppers is that so many retailers discount their merchandise across the board by 30%, 40%, even 50% off. In other words, if you’ve had your eye on a special item waiting for it to go on sale, today could be your lucky day—because virtually everything is on sale sitewide at the e-commerce operations highlighted below. Check them out, and try not to get caught shopping on the job. (Oh, and if you want to see how the discounts compare to last year’s Cyber Monday, check out our old story .) \nEXTRA 15% OFF \nTarget: A 15% discount isn’t that exciting at most stores. But it’s a very special deal when Target offers 15% on all merchandise because it sells such a huge variety of goods—and they’re generally priced reasonably to begin with. \n6pm.com: The shoes and apparel on this site are always discounted—oftentimes 30% or more—so the bargains are extra special when everything is marked down by an extra 15% off like they are for Cyber Monday. Use code CYBERMON at checkout to get the additional 15% off. \n20% TO 30% OFF \nDick’s Sporting Goods: Nearly all merchandise is discounted by an extra 25%, and standard shipping is provided for free on Monday. \nJ.C. Penney: Shoppers get an extra 25% off purchases of under $100, or 33% off orders of $100 or more on Monday. \nKohl’s: Use the code DEALSEEKER for an extra 20% off on Monday—though, to be honest, Kohl’s periodically offers 30% off everything to most shoppers throughout the year. Standard shipping is free for orders of $25 or more. \nL.L. Bean: Use promo code THANKS20 to get 20% off any purchase of $50 or more made through Tuesday, November 29. Shipping is always free for all purchases from L.L. Bean too. \nMacy’s: Shoppers get an extra 20% off nearly all purchases on Monday with the code CYBER. Because most items in the store are already on sale, the discounts can really pile up. Shipping is free for purchases of $25 or more. \nPayless Shoes: Enter code ZZCYBER1 at checkout for 30% off at this discount footwear store. \nWalgreens: The pharmacy chain’s website is offering 25% off most regular-priced items now through December 3, so it could be an excellent time to stock up on regular purchases. Use the code 7DAYS at checkout to get the discount. \n40% TO 45% OFF \nBuild-A-Bear Workshop: Enter code CYBERMONDAY1 at checkout to get 40% off make-your-own furry pets. \nCrocs: A 40% off discount is applied to nearly everything on the site (some exclusions apply). \nLands’ End: Enter the code CYBER at checkout (pin: 1000) to get 45% off everything on Monday. \nReebok: Use the code CYBER and get an additional 40% off prices across the entire site. \n50% OFF \nAbercrombie & Fitch: Everything in the store is 50% off, plus shipping is free for all orders. \nAnn Taylor: Get 50% off everything and free shipping on all purchases by entering the code CYBER50 at checkout. \nBanana Republic: Everything is 50% off on Monday for online purchases from Banana Republic. \nCalvin Klein: Everything in the store is 50% off and comes with free shipping on Monday. \nEddie Bauer: Use code ONLINE50 for 50% off everything at Eddie Bauer on Cyber Monday. Free delivery and free returns for all orders too. \nExpress: There are 50% off discounts on nearly all purchases (“featured brands” are excluded), plus free shipping comes with all orders on Cyber Monday. \nGap: Use code CYBMON for 50% off everything. \nGymboree: Nearly the entire store is discounted by 50% to 80% off, and Gymboree is offering an extra 25% off any purchase of $100 or more on Cyber Monday with use of the code BONUSDAY. Free standard shipping is provided for all purchases too. \nHollister: Enter the code CYBER50 at checkout for 50% off everything, with free standard shipping on all orders. \nJustice: Everything on the site is 50% off and all orders come with free shipping. \nLoft: Use the code CYBERMONDAY for 50% everything in stores and online. \nOld Navy: The 50% off Cyber Monday discount is automatically deducted when making an online purchase, no discount code necessary. \nTalbots: Shoppers get 50% off any regular-price item, plus 40% off their entire purchase on Cyber Monday. Free shipping for all purchases too. \nTommy Hilfiger: Enter the code CYBERGIFT50 at checkout for 50% off sitewide on Monday. ",

      "text": "Walmart is promoting its Cyber Monday deals today with a QVC-style, four-hour stream . If you missed its live run from 9AM to 1PM ET today, good news! It’s looping all day. Yes, you too can partake in this bizarre collection of corny jokes, caroling, holiday beats, and sales online. \nThe infomercial-style of hawking products is probably familiar to late-night-TV watchers, but it’s jarring to watch from your work computer. In the cold hard light of day, this level of camp feels forced, or perhaps self-aware as it all unfolds in real-time. The loop features a rotating cast of excitable salespeople promoting everything from tablets to dog food. There are also caroling segments, mini cooking shows, a hunky elf, and a guy I think is supposed to be a TV anchor of sorts for the entire program. Honestly, I’m watching the second loop now, and I’m still just as conflicted as I was the first time. \nIf you have questions about specific products, there’s also a sidebar where you can chat or ask questions. Queries are vetted by a moderator. I know this, because after a while, mine stopped showing up. Apparently someone got sick of me wondering about toothbrushes and commenting on tablet screen size.\nI won’t be buying anything from this stream, but I’m strangely captivated by its close-up shots that linger just a few seconds too long, and its hosts, whose goofing appears to cover up a great and underlying sadness. As one woman modeled a phone for the camera, she lamented having the “ugly” hands of her deceased mother. Those Cyber Monday sads are hitting me hard right now. \nReal hard.",

      "text": "Walmart wmt has tripled its online assortment of products in the last year thanks to an overhaul of its marketplace . But one company—Cartier—is less than thrilled that its pricy jewelry is now sold on Walmart’s website.\nWalmart made headlines last week when the Wall Street Journal reported that a third-party vendor , New York-based Jewelry Unlimited, was selling a $18,000 diamond watch by Cartier on walmart.com on Black Friday.\nBut Cartier took aim at Walmart on Monday and said it could not vouch for the authenticity of the watches sold via walmart.com. (Walmart does not take possession of items sold in its marketplaces. It simply provides the e-commerce infrastructure and charges a fee to the vendor.)\n“Wal-Mart is not a Cartier authorized retailer therefore Cartier has no knowledge or involvement in the selling or marketing of this watch nor can confirm the authenticity of the piece,” Cartier, a unit of Swiss luxury conglomerate Richemont, said in a statement. But the statement did not explicitly call on Walmart to stop selling the watches.\nNeither Walmart nor Cartier responded to a request by Fortune for comment. Jewelry Unlimited web site lists Cartier as a brand it sells, but Jewelry Unlimited could not be reached to comment about whether it is an authorized Cartier dealer.\nFor a company like Cartier, being sold at Walmart can be seen as potentially damaging to its luxury aura. Cartier tries to control the distribution of its goods by selling its products solely through its own stores and authorized retailers. Cartier acknowledges that its products can be found in unauthorized stores, both online and brick-and-mortar, raising the risk that faulty or even fake Cartier items may be sold to unwitting customers.\nCartier watches were also available on Amazon as of Monday evening. In the past, Cartier has been aggressive about protecting its brand identity by suing the likes of Amazon, HauteLook, and Apple aapl over in various intellectual property cases.\nEarlier this year, Walmart completed a massive upgrade of its marketplaces as it looks to compete with eBay eBay and Amazon.com amzn more effectively. There are now 23 million different products on the site, up from 8 million a year ago, allowing Walmart to offer more upscale brands like Michael Kors kors online than it has in stores.\nLast year, Tiffany & Co tif successfully sued Costco Wholesale over the sale of engagement rings that the bulk retailer called “Tiffany” by using an argument similar to Cartier’s.",

      "text": "Walmart's ( WMT ) website has become more popular this holiday season.\nThe world's largest retailer said Tuesday it saw a record number of visits to its online business from the start of Black Friday through to Cyber Monday. And once at Walmart.com, shoppers clicked on the \"buy\" button. Gross merchandise volume of items sold by third-party sellers more than doubled from last year.\nWalmart must be pleased that its stepped up efforts to compete with digital foe Amazon ( AMZN ) this holiday season are paying off. Walmart kicked off its Cyber Week deals the day after Thanksgiving at 12:01 a.m., headlined by a Samsung ( SSNLF ) 60-inch HD smart TV for $579, a savings of about $1,120.\nHelping to make the early start to Cyber Week possible was the significantly expanded number of items available for sale on Walmart's website. The company now boasts more than 23 million items for sale, in large part spurred by more third-party sellers, up from 8 million a year ago.\nWalmart also kicked off its traditional online-only sales on Thanksgiving Day, three hours earlier than last year. As for the user experience online this holiday season, Walmart has improved how fast its pages load by an average of 33% through various infrastructure investments.\nBut what looks to be a strong start for Walmart online for the holidays may come at a price to the company's bottom line.\nAbout 95% of orders from Walmart's online store shipped for free on Cyber Monday, similar to the period between Thanksgiving Day and Cyber Monday. Walmart offers free shipping to a person's home on orders of $50 or more, plus free pickup at its stores.",

      "text": "Walmart truck driver in fatal Tracy Morgan crash avoids jail Walmart truck driver in fatal Tracy Morgan crash avoids jail A fatigued Kevin Roper (r.) had been awake for over 28 hours at the time of the deadly wreck, he admitted as part of the plea deal. (Bill Denver/for New York Daily News)  53 PM \nThe sleepy driver behind the wheel of a Walmart truck that rear-ended a limo van carrying Tracy Morgan a accepted a plea deal to avoid prison for the New Jersey crash that seriously injured the comedian and killed one of his best friends. \nKevin Roper, 37, of Jonesboro, Ga., pleaded guilty to vehicular homicide and four counts of aggravated assault in the June 7, 2014, crash that killed comedian James \"Jimmy Mack\" McNair and injured Morgan so badly that it took him nearly a year to recover and resume his work. \nRoper had earlier pleaded not guilty to the charges, but took responsibility in exchange for his participation in a three-year pretrial intervention program followed by 300 hours of community service. \nRoper acknowledged he had been awake for more than 28 hours when his truck rammed into to the limo in Cranberry, N.J. Three others were also injured in the collision. The scene of the fatal crash where Roper’s 18-wheeler hit Tracy Morgan’s limousine, killing Morgan’s friend and severely injuring the comedian. (Will Vaultz/AP) \n\"It gives him an opportunity to go forward with his life without a conviction if he does what he's supposed to do,\" Roper's attorney, David Glassman, said outside the Middlesex County Courthouse in New Brunswick, \n\"It puts his future in his own hands. He's led an exemplary life up until that one mistake. And, assuming it's going to go forward like that, he has his destiny in his own hands, and he won't have a record.\" \nBefore starting his Walmart shift, Roper had driven 12 hours in his personal vehicle from his home in Georgia to his base in Delaware, according to the NTSB. Morgan’s convalescence has been slow, but steady. (Mike Coppola/Getty Images) \nAfter being hit by the Walmart truck, the limo then struck three other vehicles and rolled over before coming to rest on its side on the New Jersey Turnpike. \nThe crash left Morgan, then 45, in critical condition, with multiple broken bones and a traumatic brain injury. \nMorgan has since resumed his career. \nWalmart reached a $10 million settlement with McNair's two children in January 2015. The company also settled a lawsuit with Morgan, but the amount of the settlement was not disclosed. Join the Conversation:",

KDKA contacted Walmart on Tuesday for a timeline, but the company did not want to specify. \nBut regulatory approval by spring could open the way for work to start, and if the Moon Township Walmart – which opened a couple weeks ago is any indication – it will take about of year or so of construction. \nStay Up To Date, Follow KDKA On Twitter \nMeanwhile, just up McKnight Road at McCandless Crossing, the light at Cumberland Road is going to get a tad longer with the addition of protected left turns for safety reasons. \n“All the way around the intersection of Cumberland and McKnight [Road], and Cumberland and Babcock [Boulevard],” said Cordek. \nIn the heart of the McKnight Road business district, the cameras and sensors are now in for the intelligent traffic system. \nHowever, Kravits says, “We’ve just receive all the equipment that we need, the computers that actually run the traffic signals, so we’re going to be installing those over the next few months.” \nSo, no relief for this holiday shopping season. \n“Really, that system is not going to be operable until next spring,” Kravits said.

      "text": "December 1, 2016 Colorado sets record with Black Friday gun sales background checks \n“We’re just looking for better ways to serve our customers,” said Walmart e-commerce market coach Gina Kretoski. “The way customers shop is changing and our time is such a valuable commodity.” \nThe Thornton store, which celebrated its grand opening Wednesday, is just the second Walmart Pickup with Fuel nationwide. The first opened this spring in Huntsville, Ala . \nWalmart has chosen the Denver area to test new efforts before, including its initial forays into online grocery pickup . Denver is also a test market for the chain’s grocery delivery program. \n“This market offers great insight for what our customers want,” Kretoski said. \nNationwide, online grocery sales are growing at a pace that far exceeds those at brick-and-mortar supermarkets, said Madeline Hurley, a lead analyst at industry research firm IBISWorld. \nIn recent years, online grocery sales have increased 11 percent per year on average, compared with just 1.3 percent at supermarkets, she said. \n“There’s definitely a lot more growth opportunities in online grocery than there is in regular grocery stores,” Hurley said. \nAnd while it’s still a small piece of the overall pie — online grocery revenue was expected to hit $12.3 billion to brick-and-mortar’s $600.8 billion this year, according to IBISWorld — both startups and established grocery players are getting in on the action, she said. \n“Online grocery delivery has been around for a long time, but today it’s a lot more accessible and easier to use through mobile apps,” Hurley said. “The traditional stores like Safeway and others are seeing that, so they’re also investing as to not lose market share.” \nIn the Denver area, Walmart isn’t the only retailer to see the opportunities, either. A flood of food-delivery startups have entered the market in recent years , and Safeway recently launched its first fleet of online grocery delivery trucks in the metro area. King Soopers has been offering home delivery for years. \nWalmart has 20 Supercenters and Neighborhood Markets in metro Denver that offer free online grocery pickup, according to the company. Walmart Pickup with Fuel, though, is the only location that also has a gas station on site, Kretoski said. \n“If we offer more than one service in one location, we feel like we’re taking better care of our customers and the way they live their lives,” she said. “Customers are looking for that convenience factor.” \nOnline grocery pickup is available from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., with same-day service for orders placed by 1 p.m. Orders are fulfilled at local Walmart Supercenters and delivered to Walmart Pickup with Fuel via refrigerated truck. \nCustomers also can have other Walmart.com items delivered there for pick-up — treadmills included, Kretoski said \nInside, the store looks like a convenience store — there are hot dogs on roller grills, fresh donuts and a wall of drink options. Signs advertise “Same low price. Smaller store.” \nA small selection of grocery items are also available, with an eye toward last-minute needs, Kretoski said. The store is open from 5 a.m. to 11 p.m. \nOutside, Pat Johnson of Northglenn pulled her Honda Civic into the grocery drive-through around 10:30 a.m. Thursday. After a brief wait, a Walmart associate loaded her trunk with bag after bag of groceries. \nThe retiree said she’d definitely be back again this winter. \n“If the weather’s bad, we can just drive here,” she said.
