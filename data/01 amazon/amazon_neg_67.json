      "text": "  \nAmazon is dropping the hammer on fake goods. Purging the online marketplace of counterfeit goods is a full bore charge for the company heading into 2017, according to Bloomberg . \nNo one but the fraudsters themselves can be happy about sales of counterfeit products on Amazon. Manufacturers, brand owners, and legitimate retailers have been frustrated by fake products. Ripoffs often seem to show up immediately after a hot product launch and sell for much lower prices. Customers may leap for the knockoffs, but often rue the ‘great buys’ when they discover they paid money for low-quality goods. The brand suffers and the manufacturers, legit retailers, customers, and Amazon all suffer as well. \nMore: Amazon is taking big steps to reduce crummy reviews \nAccording to Randy Hendrix, who has sold his TRX Training System on Amazon since 2008, fake copies of his product started appearing on Amazon in 2013. His company reported every instance they found to Amazon but more fake resellers kept showing up. “We realized this was an epidemic,” said Hetrick. Although TRX enjoys annual sales of $50 million, Hetrick estimates the fakes rake in about twice that amount each year, Bloomberg reported. \nNow Amazon is making a major effort to stop the sale of phonies by not letting companies sell them on its platform. U.S. and European Amazon teams are going to reach out to brands owners to register their products with Amazon. The teams will include companies that have never sold on Amazon themselves, in some cases companies that have resisted precisely because of the presence of phonies. Once a product is in the registry, any merchant who lists the product for sale must prove to Amazon that they have a legal right to sell it online. \nDuring 2017 Amazon will focus on large companies and top brand names, hoping to build the registry fast and get the approval process working efficiently. The payoff will be huge for companies that have seen lost sales on Amazon and for companies that have stayed away because of concerns about fake products. Brands will be protected, consumers will get what they pay for, and Amazon, of course, will simultaneously boost its reputation with merchants and increase revenues. \n“Amazon has zero tolerance for the sale of counterfeit items on our site,” Amazon said in a statement. \n“The depressing thing about it is, brands that invest the most to innovate and create new products are the ones that lose the most because they are the ones the counterfeiters target,” said Hetrick, who is pleased with Amazon’s plan, according to Bloomberg. “You end up becoming the sales and marketing arm” for the counterfeiters.

      "text": "PR Brands strive for inclusivity with holiday marketing Apple, Delta, Amazon and Zales have all earned positive feedback for their efforts to bridge divisions among consumers and across the nation as a whole. By Beki Winchel | Posted: November 29, 2016 Tweet The 2016 presidential election has proven to be divisive, but many brand managers are attempting to bridge the chasm in their marketing and PR efforts. \nDelta endeared consumers—and pacified critics—when it banned a passenger for shouting belligerent political statements on a flight. \nThe New York Times reported : Delta Air Lines has barred a disruptive passenger who shouted pro- Donald Trump and anti- Hillary Clinton remarks at fellow passengers on a flight from Atlanta to Allentown, Pa., last week, the airline’s chief executive said on Monday. The chief executive, Edward H. Bastian, said in a memo published on Delta’s website that other travelers on the flight Nov. 22 would receive refunds for their tickets. \nThe decision came as many travelers lashed back after Delta’s crew allowed the passenger to remain on the flight. \nBastain praised Delta’s employees for their actions and admitted to the airline’s mistake, writing that Delta’s values include “treat[ing] one another with dignity and respect”: Part of being a reliable travel partner and a servant leader is acknowledging our mistakes so we can learn from them and respond more effectively in the future. Delta has apologized to the customers onboard that flight. We are also refunding those customers the cost of their tickets. I also want to make sure all of you know we have your backs. The heightened tension in our society means that now more than ever we must require civility on our planes and in our facilities. We must stay true to Delta’s core values and treat one another with dignity and respect. We also must remain committed more than ever to the safety of our customers and our crew members. We will not tolerate anything less. \n[ JUST ANNOUNCED: The 2017 Social Media Conference for PR, Marketing and Corporate Communicators at Disney World ] \nApple, Amazon and Zales call people to come together \nOther brand managers have made statements of inclusivity through seasonal ad spots. Here’s Apple’s holiday commercial: \nThe commercial is a message of togetherness, Techcrunch’s Romain Dillet wrote : If the message isn’t clear enough, Apple also wrote “Open your heart to everyone” at the end of the spot. While the holidays are a good opportunity to spend time with your families and friends, the company is saying that you should look beyond that. The divisions that led to the presidential election are probably one of the driving factors behind this ad too. We all share the same fears, the same smartphones and the same hesitation. So let’s be nice to one another. \n“We never pegged Frankenstein as someone who celebrates Christmas, but thanks to Apple's heartwarming Christmas commercial we wouldn't have it any other way,” Good Housekeeping’s Ryan Adelson wrote . \nApple wasn’t the only marketing team urging viewers to come together. \nForbes reported : Apple’s ad comes on the heels of a similar commercial released last week by Amazon . In that ad, an imam and priest come together over tea, share a hug, and show a genuine care for each other. It’s widely been viewed as a response to the anti-Muslim speech that characterized part of the 2016 Presidential campaign. After the ad’s release, Amazon AMZN -1.79% CEO Jeff Bezos said last week that he was “proud” of his team for creating a powerful ad. \nAmazon’s message is decidedly more overt than Apple’s: \nZales Jewelers’ marketers also embraced inclusivity with a nod to same-sex marriages in its recent holiday ad: \nThough Frankenstein’s monster, priests and imams proved to tug on consumers’ heartstrings, Zales’ use of a lesbian couple brought its social media and marketing teams controversy. \nAdweek reported : On its website, One Million Moms released a statement accusing Zales of attempting to \"normalize sin.\" It calls for people to boycott the brand, stop into Zales stores and share concerns with store managers, and urge Zales to pull the commercial and \"remain neutral\" in the culture wars. \"An even greater concern is that the commercial is airing when children are likely watching television,\" the group says. \"To make matters worse, this ad has aired during family viewing time such as football games and prime-time shows.\" As a result, Zales social media channels have been flooded. And no post—not even an innocuous one advertising Bulova watches—is safe from outrage. LGBTQ supporters are being vocal as well, pledging to back Zales with their wallets this holiday season. Ragan readers, how is your organization sending messages of togetherness this holiday season?",

      "text": "Amazon Announce ‘Best-Ever Holiday Weekend’ For Amazon Devices   John Anon \nIf you are a keen shopper, then it has probably been a busy few days for you. In fact, it seems it has been a pretty busy few days for everyone, with Thanksgiving, followed by Black Friday, which was in turn followed by Cyber Monday all taking place. Of the three days, it is starting to look as though Cyber Monday was the big winner though, with a report out earlier today stating that this year’s Cyber Monday set an online shopping record of $3.39 billion and just beating out this year’s Black Friday. One of those retailers who was likely extremely busy over the last few days is Amazon and especially during Cyber Monday, as the retailer has now confirmed that Cyber Monday was a record-breaking day for them as well. In fact, when it comes to their own hardware options, Amazon has now announced that the whole weekend was the “ best-ever Holiday shopping weekend for Amazon devices ” – which was likely helped by a number of price cuts that Amazon introduced over the weekend on their hardware products. \nAccording to the Amazon announcement, the top selling products on Amazon during the weekend included the Amazon Echo Dot, the Amazon Fire TV Stick with Alexa Voice Remote, the Amazon Fire Tablet, and the Amazon Echo. In terms of year-over-year change, Amazon notes that Amazon Echo devices sold 7 times more this Cyber Monday than they did last Cyber Monday. Likewise, Amazon Fire TV devices sold more than 2.5 times the amount they did last Cyber Monday. While their tablet sales were also twice the amount they were last Cyber Monday, which is fairly impressive on its own and when considering tablet sales in general seem to be in perpetual state of decline. \nAs is typical with these announcements though, firm numbers on exactly how many units were sold by Amazon have yet to be provided, with the retailer simply stating that there were “ millions of devices sold ”. Although Amazon is making it clear that their range of products were not just their being selling products over the weekend, but were actually the best selling products “ from any manufacturer in any category across all of Amazon ”. Which in itself is a fairly telling statement. Interestingly, the announcement from Amazon does note that the increase in figures is not just resigned to their hardware products either. As in addition to the actual device sales, Amazon notes that during Thanksgiving, Amazon Music was listened on Alexa devices 40-percent more than on any other device. Likewise, the two most streamed TV shows on Thanksgiving via Prime Video were ‘The Grand Tour’ and ‘Goliath’ – which are both ‘Amazon Original’ shows. So all in all, it seems it has been a pretty good few days over at Amazon. Post navigation",

      "text": "Amazon Prime Video Enters Canada on December 1st   Cory McNutt \nCanada takes great pride in their contributions to made-in-Canada OTT (over-the-top) services, such as the over 1 million Canadians that subscribe to CraveTV. Canada has invested money in programs of national interest as they also promote original Canadian content such as the internationally popular Orphan Black and Frontier. Bell Media operates CraveTV and is responsible for fan favorites – Saving Hope, Motive, Killjoys, and Bitten. The CRTC just had their hearing on renewing TV licensing and are concerned about a significant number of Canadians that are cutting the cord and watching TV exclusively through down streaming. It is literary changing the way that viewers enjoy their favorite TV shows or movies. \nNetflix is the largest service in Canada at 5.2 million subscribers and growing fast – up one million from just a year ago – and represents over half of the BDU (Broadcast Distribution Undertakings) households in Canada. In fact, Canadian households account for over $600 million of Netflix’s income. Now it looks like more competition is arriving with Amazon’s streaming service, Amazon Prime Video will be going live on December 1. Now as Canadian shows go bidding, the local broadcasters/streamers will have two, rather than one, additional streaming service to bid against. What troubles many is that while Netflix and Amazon are not subject to the same local regulatory requirements, they also have much more buying power behind them. \nPrime video allows access to their Original programming and Exclusive TV shows such as The Grand Tour, Red Oaks, Good Girls Revolt, PBS’ Downtown Abbey Suits, and much more. You will see Amazon Original comedies such as Fleabag, One Mississippi, Transparent, and more. They offer Prime Popular Movies, Best of Movies, and Popular TV sections and sort the content by TV Genres, and they break down the movies by Action and Adventure, Comedy, and Drama. If you use Netflix, you get a good idea how Amazon Prime Video is setup. \nSo come December 1st, Canadians will get yet another choice for streaming content to their TV or other mobile devices. There were no prices given, and we do not know if this will be the full Amazon catalog or just selected shows. However, December 1st is just a couple of days away, and Bell should reveal all of the prices and facts. Post navigation",

      "title": "Amazon Reportedly Making Alexa-Powered Echo Speaker With 7-Inch Screen",
      "text": "Amazon Reportedly Making Premium Alexa-Powered Echo Speaker With 7-Inch Screen Reddit \nAmazon.com is developing a premium Echo-like speaker with a screen, a sign the world's largest online retailer is trying to capitalize on the surprise success of its voice-controlled home gadgets and fend off competition from Google and Apple. \nThe new device will have a touchscreen measuring about seven inches, a major departure from Amazon's existing cylindrical home devices that are controlled and respond mostly through the company's voice-based Alexa digital assistant , according to two people familiar with the matter. This will make it easier to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news, the people said. They asked not to be identified speaking about a product that has yet to be announced. \nThe latest Amazon speaker will be larger and tilt upwards so the screen can be seen when it sits on a counter and the user is standing, one of the people said. \nHigh-grade speakers will make the gadget sound much better than current Echo devices, this person also said. Amazon's new device is scheduled to be announced as soon as the first quarter of 2017, this person added. Amazon , based in Seattle, Washington, declined to comment. So-called smart home gadgets are one of the latest computing battlefields fought over by the largest technology companies. However, they have so far failed to match the popularity of smartphones and personal computers. Amazon's hardware track record has been mixed too, with the disappointing launch of the Fire Phone in 2014 . Its Echo speakers have been a surprise hit though, with Consumer Intelligence Research Partners estimating US sales of more than 5 million units since 2014.\nAmazon's planned expansion of the Alexa-powered line coincides with growing competition from Alphabet Inc.'s Google Home speaker and Apple Inc.'s interest in building a home device using its Siri digital assistant. \n( Also see: The Amazon Echo Already Has a Competitor in China - The LingLong DingDong ) \nThe new Amazon device will use an optimized version of Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box. The gadget will still respond to verbal commands and spoken questions, just like current Alexa devices. Amazon is also testing a feature that allows users to pin items such as photos on their speaker's screen akin to physically placing items on a refrigerator door, one of the people said. \nAmazon plans to keep selling the Dot , Tap and Echo speakers that are typically stationed in living rooms and bedrooms, one of the people said. The current speakers cost $50, $130 and $180, respectively, while the model with a screen will likely be priced higher, the other person said. \n( Also see: Amazon's New Echo Dot Speaker Is Both Better and Cheaper ) \nSome reviewers panned the current Echo for poor audio quality, which is partly due to Amazon designing it to sound better at moderate volume levels, according to one of the people. The new speaker will play high-quality audio at all volume levels, this person said. At least one prototype version of the device places the speakers below and behind the screen, they added. \nThe Wall Street Journal reported earlier this year that Amazon's Lab126 hardware unit was working on an Alexa-powered device featuring a tablet-like computer screen known internally as \"Knight.\" \n© 2016 Bloomberg L.P.",

      "text": "6 hours ago \nAlexa is heading to the big screen. \nNot the movies, as such, but the digital assistant built into Amazon’s Echo speakers is apparently set to appear in a new, larger device with a screen in early 2017, according to a report from Bloomberg. \nThe new device will have a 7-inch touchscreen that’s tilted upwards so that it could be easily read from a countertop, according to Bloomberg. Presumably, this would make the future Echo-like device a lot easier to use to access certain types of information. For example, right now, you can ask Alexa to buy items for you off Amazon, but given that the retailer sells countless variations of the same products (for example, there are apparently 680 versions of “Hefty kitchen trash bags” available for purchase on Amazon’s US site), it’s actually quite difficult to know exactly what you’re getting without looking at the item. Similarly, if you ask Alexa a question it doesn’t know the answer to, it performs a web search and tosses the results into the Alexa app on your smartphone. In both cases, being able to display this information visually on the same screen as the device you’re interacting with may prove a lot more useful than having Alexa narrate information to you. It could well be like a more integrated version of the iPad-with-stand setup that many companies are trying to sell for using tablets in the kitchen. \nGiven that Alexa seems to be far more capable of understanding what people ask of it than Apple’s Siri voice assistant tends to be, an Echo with an integrated screen may well be a more useful device than an iPad currently is to have around the kitchen while working on a recipe and trying to set timers, convert ounces to grams, and look up ingredients. \nIn recent weeks, Amazon has seen a new contender in the smart-hub space in Google’s Home. Amazon didn’t originally have high hopes for the Echo, which emerged from the company’s skunkworks, Lab126. But the tall cylinders have become somewhat of a sleeper hit , reportedly selling over 5 million units since they were released in late 2014. Amazon has been selling the Echo for $180 (although it momentarily dropped the price to $130 for Black Friday), and a smaller Dot version for $50, but Google’s Home debuted at $120, and pretty much performs all the tasks that the Echo does just as well. \nThere have been reports that Apple too may be entering this area , and it seems that instead of competing in a race to the bottom on price, Amazon may be more interested in differentiating itself with premium products. According to Bloomberg, the new device with a screen will likely cost more than the current Echo devices available. Amazon declined to comment on its Echo plans. Read full story",

      "title": "Amazon Is Reportedly Developing a New Echo Digital Assistant With a Touchscreen",
      "text": "In a move to capitalize on the success of the Echo and Echo Dot, Amazon ( AMZN ) could release a new Echo-like speaker in 2017 that features a 7-inch touchscreen, sources told Bloomberg .\nThe device would still operate using Amazon's voice-activated Alexa software, but would have a large screen to make the weather, news and other items easily accessible. The screen will be able to tilt upwards and packs better speakers than the current Echo models, according to Bloomberg.\nThe new Echo device is expected to be pricier than the Dot, Tap and Echo speakers, which go for $50, $130 and $150, respectively. The new device will use a version of the Fire OS, the software that runs Amazon's Fire tablets and Fire TV set-top box, the sources said, according to Bloomberg .\nA touch-based device might seem like somewhat of a step backward, however, with all the buzz around voice activated technology, said Werner Goertz, an analyst at market research firm Gartner. Plus, Amazon's Alexa software isn't exactly a \"match made in heaven\" for its Fire OS, Goertz noted.\nThe Fire OS is currently optimized for use on its Fire HD8 tablet, which makes it operate somewhat clumsily since the HD8 is on par with most e-readers, Goertz said.\nThat said, a touchscreen voice assistant would help with tasks that require more complex processes, such as ordering a plane ticket.\n\"If you think of a tablet that provides a use-case where multiple options are given, tactile would add to that,\" Goertz noted. \"Voice is not as good at that.\"",

      "title": "Amazon's New Echo; Netflix-TiVo Deal; Intel's Self-Driving Car Plans -- Eye On Tech",
      "text": "Amazon is reportedly planning an upcoming release of a touchscreen Echo device. \nNetflix and TiVo agree on a product and IP deal. \nIntel's partnering with Delphi and Mobileye in an effort to build out its self-driving car business. Amazon Echo Gets a Facelift Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN ) not afraid to try out new products. Just think about its more successful run with Kindle…and its not-so-successful attempt at smartphones. Well, it looks like we can count the Echo as one of its more successful endeavors . The device sold well over the Thanksgiving to Cyber Monday stretch and is one of the best sellers on Amazon in its electronics category, trailing only its Fire TV product. Incidentally, the Fire TV Stick is also powered by Alexa, the artificially-intelligent brains behind the Echo. Now it looks like this category-leading product is about to get a facelift. Reportedly coming as soon as Q1 2017, a seven-inch touch screen Echo with better speakers and a higher price point is on the way. Good idea? Most definitely. The company's A.I.-powered device is an area that others - like Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG ) (NASDAQ: GOOGL ) - are getting involved in and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL ) sort of has via Siri. However, Amazon is a leader within that category and as its capabilities expand and versatility grows, it will be more and more useful for its customers. Amazon has every reason to continue building out the Echo lineup, be it from direct sales and a more personal, direct link to its most valuable asset: the customer. Just like with the Fire phone, Amazon knows how to react. It pulled the plug on its phone device when it didn't gain traction. The opposite is happening here, in that Echo has a lot of early traction and Amazon is pressing it along to take advantage. Good call, Bezos. Netflix, TiVo Sign Deal Shares of TiVo (NASDAQ: TIVO ) were up about 10% in Monday's after-hours trading session after it signed a deal with Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX ), but those gains evaporated in Tuesday morning's trading session. The stock finished higher by just 0.24%, while shares of Netflix climbed about 50 basis points. From the SA announcement: \"TiVo says it will integrate NFLX into its set-top boxes, and include searches across the content catalog and a Netflix button on remote controls; a separate agreement between the two companies gives NFLX a license to TiVo's patent portfolios.\" Is this a win-win for both companies? Think about it like this: Netflix gains access to patents and presumably a wider audience base. TiVo latches on to what many consider the future of TV/video consumption. While TiVo isn't exactly a mega-sized set top box provider, it is noteworthy that Netflix has found itself working with another, more classic company. Earlier this year it signed a deal with Comcast (CMSCA) to get exposure to its customers as well. It's like cable companies are finally admitting that Netflix isn't going away anytime soon and instead of fighting the tide, they will make incremental changes to be a part of it as well. It's more than likely a smart move. Netflix may have its own share of execution issues from quarter to quarter, but make no mistake about its long-term potential. The company has been a true disruptor to the video consumption world and with big (albeit expensive) deals coming down the pipe, I don't think its popularity will fade any time soon. Intel Into Self-Driving Cars? \" Auto parts maker Delphi Automotive (NYSE: DLPH ) and Mobileye (NYSE: MBLY ) are putting an Intel (NASDAQ: INTC ) chip at the heart of their joint effort to produce self-driving cars by 2019.\" The sole comment on that announcement comes from Dr. Polaris , where he says, \"Intel needs to do something to avoid becoming the next Xerox.\" I agree with Dr. Polaris and man, wouldn't it have done Intel a lot of good to get in on the M&A consolidation storm that has been sweeping through the semiconductor space. Yes, yes, Intel has made a number of small acquisitions over the year, like in virtual reality or deep learning (and yes, there was Altera last year ). But do you know what company is crushing it when it comes to growth in a number of emerging technologies? Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA ). Unfortunately, Nvidia now sports a market cap close to $50 billion thanks to the 200% appreciation to its stock price this year. However, even earlier this year the stock traded with a market cap south of $20 billion. While we will never know if Intel made an offer for Nvidia and while hindsight is indeed 20/20, it seems like the company should have pulled the trigger and tried. For the first five months of 2016 or so, a $36 billion offer would have represented about 100% premium to the company's current price. NVDA Market Cap data by YCharts It would have given Intel growth in self-driving cars, A.I., VR and a number of other markets. Technically standing at $167 billion, Intel could still do the deal. But it's too late for that now. Perhaps its recently formed Automated Driving Group can help too, but even that feels too late. It's a good idea for Intel to work with others in the space to get there. But I don't know if working with Mobileye and Delphi will be what ultimately gives Intel the growth boost it needs. Perhaps a bigger partnership or an acquisition would get Intel pointed in the right direction.

      "title": "Amazon reportedly working on a new Echo speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen",
      "text": "Youtube Amazon reportedly working on a new Echo speaker with a 7-inch touchscreen \nAmazon is working on a premium “Echo-like” speaker powered by the company’s voice assistant Alexa, according to a latest report from Bloomberg . The speaker is expected to come with a 7-inch touchscreen. \nCiting sources familiar to the matter, the report said the premium variant of the Echo will undergo a major design overhaul different from its current cylindrical one. The touchscreen will mainly make it easier for users to access content such as weather forecasts, calendar appointments, and news. Giving details about the design, the report added that the new Echo speaker will be larger in size tilt upwards so a user while standing can access the screen. Along with the touchscreen, the new Echo will have much-improved speakers. It will run on a modified version of Fire OS which is the Android-based OS that powers Amazon’s Kindle Fire tablets. \nA report from WSJ in May said that Amazon is working on a tablet-like device that is code-named as ‘Knight”. Earlier this year, Google released Google Home voice activated personal assitance. A different report from Bloomberg in September claimed tha Apple is working on an Amazon Echo-like smart-home device based on the Siri voice assistant. \nThe new permium Echo speaker could be announced as early as the first quarter of 2017, added the report. There is no word on the pricing of the speaker but it will cost more than the current Echo that retails at $179. \nSource Author: Sneha Bokil Sneha Bokil is a tech enthusiast and is currently using Nexus 5X but she still treasures her Nokia N70 (M).

      "title": "HAProxy max session limit",
      "text": "up vote 0 down vote favorite \nI have an Amazon OpsWorks stack running HAProxy (balance = source) and several node.js instances running socket.io. It seems HAProxy determines the max session limit for a given instance based on the memory limits of that instance, which is fine, but my application can often expect clients to be utilising two pages, both connected to a socket, for upwards of 4 hours. \nWith the max session limit at 40 or 180, I'd only be able to have 20/60 concurrent clients until one disconnects. So with that said, if the limit is reached, other clients will be placed in a queue until a slot becomes free which given the nature of the site is likely to not be for some while. That means I only have a working site for a serious minority. \nWhat's the best way of getting around this? I read several posts where they'll have a backend of 4,000 - 30,000 and a max session limit of just 30 per each server, but how do they achieve this? Is there a setting in HAProxy, or is it more likely they continuously reconnect/disconnect the client either through their actual application? \nEdit \nTo shed some more light on the application - it itself is a PHP application that makes use of sockets for real-time events. These sockets are done so through socket.io with that server being generated using express . This server.js file communicates with an Amazon ElastiCache Redis server (which to my understanding socket.io 1.0 handles all of this backend). \nOn the client side of things, user's connect to the socket server and emit a connect event so that to join a room unique to them. A user will then load a second page and again emit a connect event and join that same unique room. This then allows for them to emit and receive various events over the course of their session - again, this session can last upwards of 4 hours. \nHAProxy routes the user to the same server based upon their IP hash ( balance source ) - the rest of the options are kept to the OpsWorks default - see the config file below. \nI guess what I need to know is if Cur sessions hits 40, and these connections are long-lived (i.e. they don't get readily disconnected), what will happen to those in the queue? It's no good if they are left waiting 4 hours obviously. \n-- \nHAProxy.cfg global log 127.0.0.1 local0 log 127.0.0.1 local1 notice #log loghost local0 info maxconn 80000 #debug #quiet user haproxy group haproxy stats socket /tmp/haproxy.sock defaults log global mode http option httplog option dontlognull retries 3 option redispatch maxconn 80000 timeout client 60s # Client and server timeout must match the longest timeout server 60s # time we may wait for a response from the server. timeout queue 120s # Don't queue requests too long if saturated. timeout connect 10s # There's no reason to change this one. timeout http-request 30s # A complete request may never take that long. option httpclose # disable keepalive (HAProxy does not yet support the HTTP keep-alive mode) option abortonclose # enable early dropping of aborted requests from pending queue option httpchk # enable HTTP protocol to check on servers health stats auth strexm:OYk8834nkPOOaKstq48b stats uri /haproxy?stats # Set up application listeners here. listen application 0.0.0.0:80 # configure a fake backend as long as there are no real ones # this way HAProxy will not fail on a config check balance source server localhost 127.0.0.1:8080 weight 1 maxconn 5 check \nServer.js var express = require('express'); var app = express(); var server = require('http').Server(app); var io = require('socket.io')(server); var redis = require('socket.io-redis'); io.adapter(redis({ host: ###, port: 6379 })); server.listen(80); // opsworks node.js server requires port 80 app.get('/', function (req, res) { res.sendfile('./index.html'); }); io.sockets.on('connection', function (socket) { socket.on('join', function(room) { socket.join(room); }); socket.on('alert', function (room) { socket.in(room).emit('alert_dashboard'); }); socket.on('event', function(data) { socket.in(data.room).emit('event_dashboard', data); }); }); \nClient",

      "title": "Amazon’s Takeover Of The Economy Is The Real Threat To American Jobs",
      "text": "View Comments Amazon’s stranglehold on the U.S. economy is growing ever tighter, with devastating effects for the job market, says a report released Tuesday afternoon. The group’s wide-ranging analysis details how Amazon, which recently saw annual revenue top a stunning $100 billion, has reshaped the way Americans shop and radically altered the job market. After years of undercutting other retailers by selling products at a loss, funneling its customers into its super-convenient Prime service and ― essentially ― perfecting the art of online retail, Amazon is now synonymous with online shopping itself. Taking into account goods sold through third-party retailers on its site, nearly $1 of every $2 spent online currently flows through Amazon, the report found. That’s had devastating consequences for retailers who simply can’t compete ― both online and out in the real world (remember Borders?). About 149,000 jobs have been lost as Amazon’s business has expanded, according to the analysis from the nonprofit Institute for Local Self-Reliance, which advocates for fair, sustainable local economies. Amazon declined to comment on the report. In a letter to shareholders this year, the company claimed that its Marketplace, where third-party sellers offer up goods, has created 600,000 jobs. It’s unclear what kind of jobs these are, however. Donald Trump got himself elected, in part, by talking about how American jobs shifted overseas as factories closed up shop and moved abroad. That’s a process that began decades ago and, most economists would concede, has largely already rippled through the country with heartbreaking effects. Now, Amazon’s growing business poses a similar kind of threat. “I have a hard time seeing the company as anything less than a new wave of economic dislocation on par with the earlier collapse of manufacturing and small businesses that devastated so many regions of the country,” said Stacy Mitchell, co-director at the Institute and one of the report’s co-authors. Yet Trump so far has mainly confined his criticism of Amazon mostly to jabs at CEO Jeff Bezos (who has also publicly criticized Trump) and some pointed comments about how the retailer avoids paying taxes and famously doesn’t prioritize profit-making, choosing instead to push growth. Most Amazon customers have already made the tradeoff between in-person service and the slick convenience the shopping site provides. And, of course, technological advancement in the retail space isn’t solely Amazon’s province. However its utter dominance has had wide-ranging consequences. The researchers point out some other downsides to Amazon’s takeover of retailers, including fewer new products getting created or new businesses starting up. The growing popularity of online shopping also translates into store closures. The report’s authors say that Amazon has, so far, caused more than 135 million square feet of retail space to become vacant. That’s “the equivalent of about 700 empty big-box stores plus 22,000 shuttered Main Street businesses,” they write. Overall, you don’t need as many people to sell goods online as you do to sell stuff in the real world. Brick-and-mortar retailers with the same sales as Amazon would employ 294,574 people, the researchers estimate using Census data. Amazon employs just 145,800 people. And the jobs the company has created at its warehouses often pay less than comparable work, according to the report. The company pays its fulfillment workers an average of 15 percent less than the prevailing wage for comparable work in 11 metro areas where Amazon has a significant presence, the report finds. The company also relies on a growing number of temporary workers to fulfill customer orders and those jobs don’t provide the kind of benefits or simply the stability of a full-time job. In October, Amazon announced it was hiring 120,000 seasonal workers. The rub: These jobs are expected to eventually be displaced by automation, something Amazon has been particularly keen on exploring. “Amazon appears to be aiming for a future in which it employs few workers and instead relies on machines and a bench of on-demand freelancers,” the authors write. The company’s labor model is also impacting traditional package delivery companies ― UPS and the Postal service must now compete with Amazon, which is developing alternate delivery methods. The company’s low-wage, precarious labor model threatens the jobs of nearly 1 million unionized, middle-income workers at UPS and the U.S. Postal Service, the authors write. Much of the information in the new report has been detailed elsewhere ― the grueling work at Amazon’s fulfillment centers; the hard-charging atmosphere for even its white collar workers; the cutthroat tactics that led Amazon to crush competitors like Zappos and Diapers.com before eventually buying them. But the researchers also offer up interesting analysis about how Amazon relies on local tax subsidies to fuel its growth. The company has gotten at least $613 million in subsidies since 2005, according to the report. Yet, at the same time its online retail business leads to brick-and-mortar store closures, which can ultimately deprive a locality of much-needed property tax revenue. Meanwhile, in some states the company still doesn’t charge shoppers sales tax. -Huffington Post",

It will bring the brand’s products within reach of American consumers. \nInitially, Amazon will only be putting up Amul Ghee and Gulab Jamun for sale but more would be following suit. Amul Ghee according to the website is one of the top stock units in its ‘butter and margarine’ category. This would mark the dairy brand’s first official entry into the online space in the US. Though it is already selling its products there through traditional retail channels for the past 20 years, this move would expand its reach to a larger audience. \nAbout Amazon’s ‘Global Selling Program’ \n• The program is aimed at making it easy for Indian sellers to sell their ‘Make in India’ products to consumers across the world. • It offers an end-to-end solution to each seller such as assisting them with imaging, logistics, tax advisory and remittance. • It covers all sellers, including small and medium-sized enterprises, manufacturers, entrepreneurs and large brands.• After the launch of the program, there has been a 70 percent increase in online sellers in comparison to last year. A total of almost 18000 Indian sellers have started selling globally across the e-tailer’s 9 global marketplaces. • Some of the retail brands that fall under the category include Biba, Fab India, Himalaya, Organic India and Liberty Shoes. These sellers have to though pay commission equivalent to a local seller of the country in which they plan to sell. Is this article important for exams ? Yes 1 Person Agreed",

      "text": "Director Vilan Trub’s freshman effort, “Susie Q” is now available exclusively on Amazon Prime Instant Video for streaming in the US and UK. The comedy/drama, set in Queens, NY, follows two immature brothers as they develop feelings for and subsequently fight over a neighborhood girl they’re planning to rob. Susie Q on Amazon Instant Video\n“The idea of two males plotting to rob a female is not exactly general audience material, but it’s exactly why I was driven to make this movie. To me, the deplorability of it all felt very Hitchcock in nature, right down to the blonde femme fatale. And when you have the two lazy and incompetent adolescents develop a crush on their target, it’s hard not to smile at the absurdity of it all,” said the film’s writer and director, Vilan Trub. “It’s an interesting story and I felt it would make for an interesting movie.”\nFilmed on a shoestring budget over the course of several years, the movie made its premiere earlier this year at the New York City Independent Film Festival to a sold out audience. When the time came to settle on distribution for the movie, the goal was to utilize a platform that is most successfully reaching modern movie-viewing audiences.\nAmazon Instant Video is transforming the media landscape and is a great home for cinema that is having an increasingly harder time competing with superhero movies at the box office. Video on demand services grant access to quality movies and television on a convenient platform, quickly gaining a reputation as the future of the industry.\nAccess the full press-kit and hi-res multimedia\nAbout Vitelloni Productions, Inc.\nVitelloni Productions was launched by Vilan Trub in 2009 as a means to independently produce feature length films. Their next movie is a crime-drama tentatively titled The Dirty Kind, scheduled to start production on December 9th. The movie follows an ambitious private investigator specializing in divorce who accidentally uncovers a grisly crime, changing his outlook on the profession and life.",

      "title": "Amazon Worker Jumps Off Company Building, 12 Stories",
      "text": "An unidentified Amazon employee jumped from the company headquarters in Seattle on Nov. 28, but survived his 12-story fall.\nAn Amazon source told Bloomberg Technology that the employee sent a company-wide email to hundreds of co-workers and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos before the apparent suicide attempt.\nAccording to police, the man was taken to a local hospital.\nAmazon said in a statement: \"Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover. He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.\"\nBloomberg Technology's Amazon source said the man wanted to be transferred to a different part of the company, but instead was moved onto an employee improvement plan, which can result in being fired if there is no improvement.\nIn 2014, several purported Amazon employees emailed Gawker with their horror stories about Amazon's \"performance improvement plan,\" also known as PIP.\nOne former Amazon employee, who said she went through PIP, told Gawker:\nI would not want such a thing to happen even to my enemy. Does Jeff Bezos have the guts to sign a PIP document himself? If so many employees are put into PIP for non performance, is that not an indication that the organization is also non performing? In that case, the CEO should also take up the PIP challenge... I can tell you in detail about the PIP program. In Amazon, PIP is being used as a tool to fire employees. That is, once you are into a PIP you can be sure that you would be made to quit within a maximum of 3 months...\nNow for the details of PIP. Let us assume that an employee works for Amazon for the past 5 years. In those 5 years, the employee would have at least made one mistake in his or her work. Once Amazon decides to fire that employee they would dig out that mistake and project that the employee had created a huge loss to the company because of that mistake.\nThen the employee would be put into what is called a \"Coaching Plan\" for 2 months (The duration might differ depending on the manager) before starting PIP. While the employee is in \"Coaching Plan\" he or she is not supposed to make even a single small mistake in his or her work.\nBut the point to be noted here is, there will not be any coaching or training to the employee during this period. They will have to work just normally like others but each and every movement of them would be monitored...\nI will share with you a few clauses from PIP agreement. It will be rude and threatening to read through those clauses.\n1) 'This is a final performance improvement plan for substandard performance'\n2) 'You have been counselled and warned about your performance issues previously'\n3) 'This is a final warning that your job is in jeopardy'\n4) 'You continued employment is subject to you meeting the following goals and objectives'\n(There will a new set of goals assigned during the PIP period, which would be much more difficult to achieve than the regular goals)\n5) 'The responsibility for bringing your performance to an acceptable level rests with you'\n6) 'A copy of this document will be placed in your personnel file'\n7) 'If you fail to meet the above stated expectations, your employment may be terminated'\nAfter the PIP starts, they will catch hold of any one mistake of the employee within those 3 months period and ask them to put down their papers. They will not be terminated but asked to resign. Gawker did not mention a response from Amazon regarding the article.\n",

      "title": "Liquidware Labs Announces Full Support for Amazon WorkSpaces with Leading Workspace Environment Management Suite",
      "text": "Liquidware Labs, a leading provider of desktop transformation solutions for virtual, physical, and cloud-based desktops, today announced that the company’s Workspace Environment Management suite, known as Liquidware Labs Essentials, now fully supports Amazon WorkSpaces. Liquidware Labs has partnered with Amazon WorkSpaces (AWS) to offer Liquidware Labs Essentials, including its Stratusphere solutions, ProfileUnity and FlexApp, to organizations that can benefit from the company’s Workspace Environment Management offerings. The Liquidware Labs products for Amazon Workspaces are available on the AWS Marketplace or by downloading at http://www.liquidwarelabs.com .\nAWS provides a powerful global infrastructure fabric upon which desktops can be rapidly provisioned and sized, based not only on initial design, but more importantly, as the environment grows and changes over time. This ease and flexibility – combined with the enhanced security the AWS cloud offers – makes cloud desktops an increasingly attractive option for many large organizations. Cloud-based desktops can be rapidly provisioned for peak usages times, to establish consistent user experience after mergers or acquisitions or to support remote workers more effectively.\nLiquidware Labs solutions will be highlighted in a presentation to be given at re:Invent that will be co-presented by Nick Frank, Practice Lead at AHEAD, a Liquidware Labs channel partner.\n“Liquidware Labs has been an AHEAD partner for six years in the on-premises VDI space. As our End-User Computing team has expanded its focus into the public cloud space with Amazon WorkSpaces, we needed solutions that can scale and support a hybrid cloud architecture,” says Nick Frank, Practice Lead for Mobility and End User Computing at AHEAD. “We wanted to present a perspective to help our customers understand why you need best-of-breed solutions when moving desktops to the cloud and how to accomplish that successfully.”\nFor more information and to register for this re:Invent session, follow this link.\nENT201 - Deploying Amazon WorkSpaces at Enterprise Scale to Deliver a New Desktop Experience\nAWS Solutions are increasingly an option for many types of organizations looking for a more streamlined approach to scaling their virtual desktops.\n“In September, we integrated the AWS WorkSpaces offering into our learning process. To better understand how our students used the newly introduced platform, we looked to Liquidware Labs to help us. Being able to use both Stratusphere and ProfileUnity allowed us to provide better support to our students and allowed us to maintain our ‘student first’ focus,” said Greg M. Smith, Associate VP, Enterprise Operations, University of Maryland University College.\nLiquidware Labs Essentials adds the following capabilities to Amazon WorkSpaces:\n Assess current physical or virtual desktops for Amazon WorkSpaces readiness with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere FIT. The solution provides joint customers with in depth usage metrics including GPU demand, application usage, storage sizing, and more for decision support when choosing the right Amazon WorkSpaces level. Gain knowledge of existing desktop environment usage which can be leveraged for desktop image design and application delivery strategies in the new Amazon WorkSpaces desktops. Migrate users to Amazon WorkSpaces and manage with User Environment Management (UEM) with Liquidware Labs ProfileUnity. Harvest and move user profiles and data and be prepared for Amazon WorkSpaces upgrades to future OS versions such as Windows 10/Server 2016. Leverage robust UEM features that go beyond Microsoft Active Directory and Group Policies. Layer applications for Amazon WorkSpaces environments without modifying base images with Liquidware Labs FlexApp. Application layering enables easy application delivery per user, group, or context aware setting. FlexApp applications co-exist easily with Amazon WorkSpaces Application Manager (WAM) applications. Monitor User Experience and Optimize Amazon WorkSpaces. Identify desktop performance bottlenecks with Liquidware Labs Stratusphere UX. Ensure that Amazon and Internet provider service level agreements are being met. Troubleshoot desktop performance issues including excessive login delays, boot storms, and identify IOPS bottlenecks. Gain decision support of desktop performance when needs change to right-size your Amazon WorkSpaces subscription level.\n“Liquidware Labs is a pioneer in the Workspace Environment Management space in the virtual desktop market and has helped many Citrix and VMware customers achieve success when rolling out both on premises virtual desktops and cloud-based desktops, said Mark Bowker, Senior Analyst, Enterprise Strategies Group. “It is exciting to see them fully embrace and extend their innovative products’ support for Amazon Workspaces. When Liquidware Labs user experience, user environment management and layering solutions are leveraged in Amazon Workspaces environment, customers gain a very mature and comprehensive desktop DaaS offering.”\nIn addition to Amazon WorkSpaces, Liquidware Labs solutions support any Windows desktop including virtual, physical or cloud-based environments. The solutions also support Citrix XenApp and XenDesktop, VMware Horizon running on premises or in any cloud such as Amazon AWS, Microsoft Azure, or Google Cloud. Therefore, organizations do not need to choose among platforms – virtual or physical – they can use Liquidware Labs solutions for all of their desktops in their environment.\n“We see a future where on-premises desktops will be consistently paired with cloud-based desktops,” said Tyler Rohrer, who spearheads alliances for Liquidware Labs and manages the Amazon relationship. “When extending our solutions to Amazon WorkSpaces, as well as all desktops in their environment, organizations can enter a new era of simplicity, scalability and control over provisioning and managing their Windows desktops.”\nFor more information on the complementary nature of the Liquidware Labs Workspace Solutions Stack for Amazon WorkSpaces, please visit the Liquidware Labs website at: http://www.liquidwarelabs.com/solutions/solutions-cloud/amazon-workspaces\nAbout Liquidware Labs\nLiquidware Labs™ provides industry leading platform-agnostic desktop solutions for hybrid Windows desktop environments including Citrix® XenApp/XenDesktop, VMware Horizon View®, and physical Microsoft® Windows PCs.

      "text": "Amazon worker attempts suicide at Seattle headquarters By Jerry White 30 November 2016 \nA distraught employee leaped off the rooftop of Amazon’s Seattle, Washington headquarters in a suicide attempt Monday morning. The unidentified worker was hospitalized in critical condition after miraculously surviving the 12-story fall from the Apollo building, one of several structures at the South Lake Union campus where 20,000 employees of the online retail giant work. \nBefore trying to take his life, the worker sent an e-mail seen by hundreds of co-workers and Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos criticizing the way the company handled his request to transfer to a different department, according to a person familiar with the situation who spoke to Bloomberg News . \nThe worker had recently put in the request but was placed on a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP), a status that means likely termination in three months or less for not meeting work quotas and other company demands. In the email, the worker “hinted that he might harm himself,” the person who asked not to be identified told Bloomberg. \nAmazon officials would not reveal the content of the email and issued a cursory statement to the media, saying, “Our thoughts are with our colleague as he continues to recover. He’s receiving some of the best care possible and we will be there to support him throughout the recovery process.” \nWhile many details are still unknown and conditions are relatively different, the tragedy cannot but remind one of the suicides of Chinese workers facing unbearable conditions at electronics manufacturing firm Foxconn. After an international furor following 14 deaths in 2010, the maker of Apple and Samsung phones installed netting and forced workers to sign pledges that they would not kill themselves. \nMonday’s event in Seattle sheds light on the realities of the “new economy” in the United States and the working conditions at Amazon, which employs 268,000 full- and part-time employees worldwide and plans to hire another 120,000 temporary workers in the US for the holiday season. \n“The suicide attempt is terrible,” Michael Subit, an attorney in Seattle who has handled unfair termination cases brought by Amazon workers, told the World Socialist Web Site . “Certainly being put in the Performance Improvement Plan frequently leads to termination in a couple of months. Sometimes a worker succeeds, but more often than not they are let go. \n“I am not a medical doctor, but for someone who has legally represented workers for 25 years I know that work is so fundamental to how workers define themselves. The prospect of losing their livelihoods also means the prospect of losing themselves, and it could trigger serious emotional responses from workplace violence to attempted suicide.” \nIn 2015, Amazon reached $100 billion in revenue for the first time, and it currently has a market capitalization of nearly $300 billion. Company CEO Jeff Bezos has a net worth of $66 billion and is number two on the Fortune 400 list for America’s richest people. He added $20 billion to his net worth over the 12 months through September 2016. \nBezos has championed the use of technology and data collection not only for determining the buying habits of consumers but also for imposing a relentless drive to sweat more output from warehouse workers, delivery drivers and office workers. \nConditions inside of Amazon’s giant “fulfillment centers” are notorious, with “pickers” expected to pull 100 items or more per hour and walk more than 12 miles over the course of a shift to fill orders. The handheld scanners workers use to locate items in the warehouses allow managers to track precisely how long it takes to fill an order, with those failing to “make rate” subject to losing their jobs. In 2011 it was revealed that workers at an eastern Pennsylvania center were working in 100-degree heat, with ambulances waiting outside to take away those collapsing from exhaustion. \nIn August 2015, the New York Times did an HYPERLINK \"http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/16/technology/inside-amazon-wrestling-big-ideas-in-a-bruising-workplace.html\" exposé of conditions facing developers, engineers, finance specialists and other office workers who regularly labor 80-85 hours a week and face cutthroat competition to retain their jobs and positions. In its offices, “Amazon uses a self-reinforcing set of management, data and psychological tools to spur its tens of thousands of white-collar employees to do more and more.” \n“The company is running a continual performance improvement algorithm on its staff,” Amy Michaels, a former Kindle marketer, told the Times . \n“Even many Amazonians who have worked on Wall Street and at start-ups say the workloads at the new South Lake Union campus can be extreme: marathon conference calls on Easter Sunday and Thanksgiving, criticism from bosses for spotty Internet access on vacation, and hours spent working at home most nights or weekends.” \nOffice workers are subjected to monthly “business reviews” where they are criticized for not meeting “team goals.” Workers are encouraged to use the “Anytime Feedback Tool” to inform on co-workers in comments only management reads. “Because team members” are ranked, and those at the bottom eliminated every year, “it is in everyone’s interest to outperform everyone else,” the Times reported. \nEvery year there is an Organizational Level Review where managers debate the rankings of their subordinates, assigning and reassigning names to boxes in a matrix projected on the wall also known as “stack ranking” or “rank and yank.” The newspaper noted, “As the hours pass, successive rounds of managers leave the room, knowing that those who remain will determine their fates.” \nIn addition to these annual cullings—referred to as “Purposeful Darwinism” by one former top Amazon human resource director—the company regularly threatens to terminate workers who take time off because of illness, pregnancy, caring for elderly parents or other pressing family needs. \n“A woman who had breast cancer was told that she was put on a ‘performance improvement plan’—Amazon code for ‘you’re in danger of being fired’—because ‘difficulties’ in her ‘personal life’ had interfered with fulfilling her work goals.” Another female worker who suffered a miscarriage was put on a PIP, telling the Times , “I had just experienced the most devastating event in my life” only to be told her performance would be monitored “to make sure my focus stayed on my job.” \nSubit said he is now working on a class action case brought by Amazon delivery drivers against the company and its subsidiaries. “This is a significant issue regarding the ‘Gig Economy,’ because the company is avoiding classifying its drivers as employees. The complaint charges that Amazon.com and Amazon Logistics are misclassifying drivers as ‘independent contractors’ so they don’t have to pay minimum wages and overtime.” \nThese conditions are not limited to the US. According to a BBC report, Amazon drivers in the United Kingdom are forced to speed, and some had to urinate or defecate in their trucks, in order to meet the company’s demanding delivery schedules. \nBezos, who also owns the Washington Post , wields significant political power. Last May he was a guest at the White House, where he joined the Obamas in announcing Amazon’s plan to hire 25,000 veterans and military spouses. A vocal critic of Donald Trump, Bezos quickly congratulated the Republican after the election, tweeting, “I for one give him my most open mind and wish him great success in his service to the country.” \nLast week, a US District judge in Cincinnati ordered a halt to a strike by pilots for Air Transport Services Groups, which hauls packages for Amazon.com. Two hundred and fifty pilots struck November 22 to protest manpower shortages. \nGranting ABX Air’s request for a temporary restraining order during Amazon’s peak sales period—from Thanksgiving through so-called Cyber Monday—US District Judge Timothy Black declared, “The public expects that purchases and shipments will be delivered in a timely fashion. Absent an injunction, ABX, its customers and the public will suffer immediate, irreparable harm. Imagine Christmas without Amazon!”",

      "text": "Turn on tldr \nSix months after launching a self-serve video distribution program, Amazon is a growing revenue provider for publishers and independent filmmakers alike. \nLaunched in May , the Amazon Video Direct program helps publishers of varying sizes and types join the Amazon Prime video ecosystem. In terms of distribution, publishers have multiple options: They can make their content available alongside thousands of movies and TV shows on the Prime streaming subscription service; sell their existing subscription streaming channels as add-ons; make individual titles available for purchase or rent; or make the content available on a free and ad-supported basis. \nWhile publishers aren’t restricted to any one option, the ability to put their content on Prime Video, which offers thousands of movies and TV shows and has tens of millions of subscribers, is the most popular choice, according to Eric Orme, head of Amazon Video Direct. “The friction in place to get content onto a tier-one service is pretty high. There are a lot of complexities and barriers there, in general,” Orme said. “We solve that problem.” Advertisement \nOnce publishers join the Amazon Video Direct program, they also retain control over how their content is distributed — all with the knowledge that every option comes with a revenue model from the get-go. For instance, if a publisher chooses to upload its content to Amazon Prime Video, it gets 20 cents per hour streamed in the U.S. (up from 15 cents per hour when the program launched), sources said. Internationally, content owners get 6 cents per hour streamed. \nThese are not the only Prime Video-related revenues, either. Amazon also sets aside a $1 million monthly bonus pool through its Amazon Video Direct Stars program, which pays content owners based on the top-performing titles on the streaming platform. (Other ways to make money through Video Direct include 55 percent of ad revenue generated from content that’s available for free, as well as roughly 50 percent of money made from sales and rentals.) \nWhile not making anyone rich just yet, the Video Direct program is beginning to bring in revenue for publishing partners. How Stuff Works, for instance, has uploaded more than 500 videos to Amazon Prime since the program launched. Revenue from the Video Direct program has “on occasion” been comparable to YouTube, where it has nine channels and close to 2 million subscribers, said Jason Hoch, chief content officer for How Stuff Works. Similarly, Video Direct-related revenue for The Young Turks Network is small but getting more meaningful every month, said Steven Oh, COO of The Young Turks Network. (Both companies have also received cash from the Video Direct Stars program.) \nFor How Stuff Works, which hasn’t experimented with a paid model to date, this is an entirely new revenue stream. This will become a bigger deal as How Stuff Works is in development on multiple longer-form shows that it can distribute on Amazon Prime starting next year. It’s something that Amazon has encouraged How Stuff Works to do, Hoch said. \n“ We may decide that some of that content might be available as a rental, some might be ad-supported, and some might be just Prime, where we’re getting a payout through hours watched,” Hoch said. “Having both the flexibility and the math behind it is pretty great.” \nFor Amazon, Video Direct is a play for the entire video ecosystem. For instance, independent filmmakers are also finding success through the Video Direct program. The ‘90s cult classic, “The Boondock Saints,” for instance, has streamed more than 500,000 hours in a month, according to Amazon. Other independent projects like Danishka Esterhazy’s “Black Field,” which premiered at film festivals in 2009 but never received a U.S. theatrical release, was one of the most-watched films in October. \nOverall, Amazon users have streamed billions of minutes of content from Amazon Video Direct self-publishers, Amazon said. \n“Our customers are looking for a variety of different things,” Orme said. “If we were to only focus on specific categories or specific providers, there will be stuff we’re going to miss.” Related",

      "text": "(credit: Amazon)\nAmazon may be adding to its Echo family very soon. A report from Bloomberg suggests the online retailer is working on a new Alexa-based speaker device with a seven-inch touchscreen, which would make it the first Alexa device with a screen. Currently Amazon's £150 Echo , Tap (not yet available in the UK), and £50 Dot are cylindrical devices, some with speakers and some without, that all contain the company's digital assistant.\nAccording to the report, the new device will have a touchscreen that can be tilted upward so it's more easily visible when sitting on a counter or table. The screen will make it more convenient for users to access information like weather reports, calendar events, and news. All of that information can currently be accessed by voice-commanding Alexa to read it out, but the screen would give that information a visual component. It's also reported that the new device will have even better speakers than the current Echo, which would likely make it a better music playback device.\nIn addition to using Alexa to control the new device, users will be able to interact with the screen almost like a tablet. Bloomberg reports the device will run \"an optimised version of Fire OS,\" which is the operating system used in Amazon's tablets. Amazon is also testing a feature that would let users \"pin\" items to the device's screen, similar to how you could use a magnet to place something on a refrigerator door. This feature sounds similar to the messaging features on Triby , one of the first third-party devices to incorporate Alexa. That device uses a small, e-ink display to show messages sent between family members as well as date and weather information.\nRead 2 remaining paragraphs | Comments ",

      "title": "Zadie Smith's 'Swing Time' Makes for a Difficult Dance (Review)",
      "text": "Amazon \nEver since James Wood irritably classified Zadie Smith’s debut novel White Teeth (2000) as “hysterical realism”, quite a lot of ink has been spilled praising or deriding the adaptability of her subsequent fiction. Yet while her techniques and influences have indeed varied over time— On Beauty (2005), for example, paid homage to the domestic interplay of E.M. Forster’s Howards End , while NW (2012) refracted contemporary London through a gaze evoking Virginia Woolf—Smith’s vivacious, wide-roving, and often satirical perspective has consistently provided a stylistic through-line. \nWith her most recent novel, Swing Time , Smith continues her protean evolution by downplaying her characteristic humor and exploring the lives of her characters through a subjective first-person viewpoint, a technique she had not attempted until now. When we first encounter our narrator, who remains unnamed throughout, she’s encamped in a London flat, recently dismissed from her position as personal assistant to an Australian pop-star named Aimee. Clearly harmed by her proximity to fame, the narrator seems to provide Smith a means of critiquing all the attention she has received since her ascendance in the literary world at the age of 24. (Surely hype and jealousy have had something to do with all the critical nit-picking.) \nBut Swing Time is chiefly concerned with other, loftier, themes, many of which—race, parenting, female friendship, the passage of time—are recurrent for Smith, allowing the novel to comfortably inhabit her oeuvre despite also being a departure of sorts. The plot is divided into interwoven twin braids that each center around one of the narrator’s defining female relationships. We find that, before professionally fawning over Aimee, the narrator was enraptured with a childhood friend named Tracey with whom she eventually lost touch. Thinking back to the day they first met outside of a dance class, the narrator notes, “There were many other girls present but for obvious reasons we noticed each other… Our shade of brown was exactly the same—as if one piece of tan material had been cut to make us both.” But even though they live in adjacent council estates, are both biracial, and are each obsessed with dance, the two girls don’t always make a perfect match. \nTo Tracey, the fact that the narrator’s father is white and her mother Jamaican means that their family has things “the wrong way round”. Tracey’s own father drifts in and out of the picture, and she explains his absence by casting him as a backup dancer for Michael Jackson. Meanwhile, Tracey’s doting mother buys her daughter all the latest toys and lets the girls watch Top of the Pops while they eat angel cakes for dinner. In comparison, the narrator’s home feels drab and loveless, if a bit more practical. Her mother spends most of her time reading political and social theory, destined to one day acquire a university degree and a seat in Parliament. Her postal worker father plays the role of primary caretaker, cooking dinner, packing lunches, and taking her to dance classes. \nWith the benefits of a progressive household not yet clear to her, the narrator is “confused and wounded” by her mother’s “refusal to submit to me”, and a feeling of inadequacy colors her conception of herself throughout the novel. She’s the sort of character who could only unveil herself over the course of an entire book, and even then we must work hard to inspect what’s been concealed. Finding it easier to idolize others than build her own self-esteem, she decides early on “that if I could dance like Tracey I would never want for anything else in this world”: \nEvery movement was as sharp and precise as any child could hope to make it, her body could align itself with any time signature, no matter how intricate… I was—I am—in awe of Tracey’s technique. \nThe girls spend a great deal of time watching music videos and imitating their raunchy dance moves (thanks to Tracey’s insistence), but the narrator prefers the more graceful choreography of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. She recalls a VHS tape she and Tracey watched countless times: “We were the first generation to have, in our own homes, the means to re- and forward-wind reality: even very small children could press their fingers against the clunky buttons and see what-has-been become what-is or what-will-be.” In the same fashion, the novel itself begins to two-step back and forth in time, dancing between Tracey’s story and Aimee’s. (The book’s title, borrowed from an Astaire film that proves pivotal to the plot, also underscores the emphasis on malleable time.) \nIt perhaps comes as no surprise that a protagonist so prone to idolatry would grow up to assist a self-indulgent pop-star, helping Aimee “float over the surface” of life while wading “through the tangled weeds” of her own selflessness. Despite having completely relinquished any life of her own, the narrator tirelessly coddles Aimee, “a person for whom I scheduled abortions, hired dog walkers, ordered flowers, wrote Mother’s Day cards, applied creams, administered injections, squeezed spots, wiped very occasional break-up tears, and so on.” With all the refuse of her life neatly stacked, Aimee is free to view her accomplishments as fated. Having purportedly experienced a difficult childhood, she’s a spokesperson for upward mobility. As selfless and banal as the narrator’s job is in practice, the global jet-setting and proximity to glamour do comprise a success story for a biracial girl from a Northwest London project. But even though she has come a long way, she remains haunted by her inability to live up to her mother’s expectations. Much of this confusion can be traced back to the “private drama” of her racial identity, which often makes her feel like “a changeling belonging to neither” her father nor her mother. Determined not to feel confused, she seems to be in denial about a world that refuses to see her as anything but black. Her mother, having no time for the trivialities of dance or pop culture, announces: \nAll that matters in this world… is what’s written down. But what happens with this”—she gestured at my body—“that will never matter, not in this culture, not for these people, so all you’re doing is playing the game by their rules, and if you play that game, I promise you, you’ll end up a shade of yourself. \nThis is the “game”, we realize along with the narrator, that Tracey has played, despite—or perhaps because of—her early success as a dancer. Having largely escaped from this particular struggle, the narrator is left to puzzle out what remains of her “blackness”. In the latter half of the novel, she spends a great deal of time in a West African village where Aimee is building a school for girls; here she finds the complexity of her identity suddenly rendered moot: \nI was not… standing… with my extended tribe, with my fellow black women… There were only the Sere women, the Wolof, the Mandinka, the Serahuli, the Fula and the Jola, the last of whom, I was told once, grudgingly, I resembled. \n\nHere, the very gains that the narrator has made threaten to shut her out of the potential catharsis of visiting the “motherland” that her own mother so blatantly romanticizes. While even the poorest members of the village can trace their ancestry for generations, the narrator—like any descendent of slaves—must grasp desperately for any authentic connection to the past. This double bind, which makes her an outsider both at home and in Africa, accentuates the importance of the novel itself as a reckoning with the crosscurrents and contradictions of history. \nVery early on, the narrator’s mother tells her of the sankofa, a bird from Ghanaian folklore that has become important to African diaspora: “It looks backward, at the past, and it learns from what’s gone before.” Swing Time is an ambitious and fulfilling exploration of this folkloric concept, swinging from one time frame to another without trying to fill in all the gaps. Whether relating to cultural heritage, childhood rivalry, or the back-and-forth routines of Astaire and Rogers, learning from the past is not as simple as pressing rewind: it’s a dance that’s quite difficult to execute.

      "text": "Tweet For anyone who's ever wondered why eSports these days seems limited to the first-person shooter or the arena battler, there's an event coming up specifically for you. Amazon has set up a $100,000 prize pool for its first-ever Appstore eSports tournament in a bid to find out who's the best around in casual gaming.Dubbed the Champions of Fire Invitational, the game will feature 16 streamers--including Renee \"lolRenaynay\" Reynosa, Albert \"Boxbox\" Sun Zheng, and Brian Kibler, as they duel to the high scores in Las Vegas on December 2. Five titles form the basis of the tournament, as Fruit Ninja Tournament, Pac-Man 256, Bloons TD Battles, 8 Ball Pool, and Disney Crossy Road all factor in. The best across all five games takes home the top prize of $30,000, while lesser prizes are likewise on hand. Those interested in catching the big show can do so via a large portion of Amazon's ecosystem.By way of explanation, Aaron Rubenson , director of Amazon's Appstore, commented \"Competitive video gaming has seen huge growth, and we see tremendous customer value in expanding the tournament experience to include the casual mobile games played by millions of people today. The Champions of Fire Invitational will see some of the top gaming pros square off in the same fun games our customers can download and enjoy today from the Amazon Appstore.”While it may seem a bridge too far to turn casual gaming into tournament-grade eSports fodder, it's really not so outlandish. Is watching two teams attempt to kill each other in Counter-Strike really so far different from watching two people go for first to 10,000 or whatever in Fruit Ninja? The basic principles stand, even if the presentation varies a bit. Plus, let's face it; casual gaming has a significant audience to it, and that's prime ground for a forward-thinker like Amazon to work. That's good news for the gaming market in general.We might well see more of this kind of eSports operation to come; if Apple and Google aren't already working on something similar, I'd be shocked. I don't know how long it will take to come around, but we'll likely see more casual gaming tourneys step in as gamers expand their horizons and the market follows along.

      "text": "The Morning After: Wednesday, November 30, 2016 Amazon's next Echo and Super Mario World IRL Save \nHey, good morning! You look fabulous. \nTake a trip to Super Mario World on MDMA while touching an Echo. It's Wednesday, where hackers are the ones getting hacked and the Internet Archive needs a Canadian backup copy. \nPut a tablet on it Amazon's next Echo could include a touchscreen \nIn case you were wondering what's next for Amazon's Alexa-connected devices, a Bloomberg rumor suggests the answer is a 7-inch embedded touchscreen. The rumor points to a \"premium\" device with the display built-in, running (of course) a version of its Android-based FireOS, optimized to show info like forecasts, calendar events and news. \nTimewasters that don't involve fake news Facebook Messenger supports 17 multiplayer games \nFacebook's Instant Articles have been joined by Instant Games, a suite of experiences built into its Messenger app and web experience that lets friends play together without installing anything extra. \"Pac-Man,\" \"Words with Friends,\" \"Galaga,\" \"Arkanoid\" and more are available, complete with leaderboards for maximum competition over bragging rights. \nWhat a twist! SF Muni hacker gets hacked \nIn a turn of events, Brian Krebs reports that the hacker who attempted to ransom the SFMTA's computers had their systems hacked, revealing quite a bit about how their business works. The data exposed indicates the individual has pulled this scheme on other companies running vulnerable Oracle server products. The transit agency told its attacker to kick rocks, however, restoring the systems from a backup instead of paying up. The lesson here? Back up everything regularly, and don't use easily-guessed password reset questions. \nIt's all about verticality Dinosaurs are a perfect fit for VR \nSince we're still in the early days of VR, everyone is trying to get a handle on what experiences work best. Plop on a headset, and you'll quickly notice that many developers have picked an element straight from our kindergarten favorites list: dinosaurs. As Oculus artist Derrick Hammond explains, they \"have an epic sense of scale that immediately makes you appreciate the potential of VR.\" \nSuper Mario World, for real Universal Osaka, Orlando and Hollywood are getting Nintendo video game areas \nNow we know a bit more about the team-up between Universal Parks & Resorts and Nintendo, like where the integrated experiences will appear. According to execs, visiting the themed areas will make tourists feel like \"they've walked into their favorite gaming platform.\" Most of the details are still fuzzy but expect to see the new areas open up separately at each park over the next few years. \nMDMA as a prescription drug? The FDA just approved large-scale trials using ecstasy to treat PTSD \nThe Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) has gained approval to expand its studies using MDMA as part of a treatment for people suffering from PTSD. They're trying to find out if drug-assisted sessions combined with therapy can help patients when currently approved methods don't work. If it's approved, the \"club drug\" could be available for use in treatment by 2021. \nThe impact of these policies go far beyond business Extremely competitive work-visa programs face an uncertain future under President Trump \nThe president-elect recently released his 100-day plan that says he will call upon the Department of Labor to investigate visa programs, but not much is clear beyond that. Cherlynn Low interviewed several lawyers about the future of H-1B visas as well as other programs tech companies rely on for hiring. But wait, there's more... ",

      "text": "Amazon’s next-gen Echo speaker will have a 7-inch display, coming early 2017 Next-gen Amazon Echo coming soon \nAmazon’s Echo connected speakers has been dominating the smart home ecosystem for a few years despite Google offering its own alternative. \nNow if you have considered purchasing an Echo this holiday season, you might want to wait a little bit. According to a new report coming out of Bloomberg indicates that Amazon is working towards a next-gen high-end speaker , due for release sometimes in early 2017. \nFollowing the surprise success of the Echo , Amazon is now looking to introduce a successor in order to keep customers interested in its home gadgets lineup. \nIt appears that the next-gen gadget will trade the cylindrical design of the current Echo for a new one. The new speaker will take advantage of a 7-inch touchscreen which tilts upwards, so that people can have a better view when the device is placed on top of the kitchen counter. \nThe 7-inch screen will run a modified version of the Fire OS , Amazon’s own custom take on Android which currently runs on Fire tablets, Fire TV and the Fire TV Stick. Naturally, the new Echo will take advantage of Alexa’s services. To make it more appealing, Amazon will probably deliver an improved, more intelligent Alexa next year. \nWhat’s more, the report at hand says that Amazon is currently testing a new feature that will allow users to pin things like image on the 7-inch screen. Think old school refrigerator notes or post-its. \nFurthermore, the next-gen Alexa is said to feature a set of high-quality speakers which will be capable of delivering great sound. \nAs mentioned earlier, the new Echo is expected to make a debut in the first quarter of 2017. In the meanwhile, Amazon will continue to sell its affordable Dot, Tap and Echo speakers . \nThe home connected speaker market seems to be growing at fast rates. Google’s already offering its Home alternative and Apple is also said to be working towards a smart-home device with Siri onboard. \nHere at Android Guys we’re big appreciators of the Amazon Echo , so we are pretty curious to see where Amazon takes it next.",

      "title": "Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini Prime Now Available on Amazon - Android Headlines",
      "text": "Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini Prime Now Available on Amazon November 30, 2016 - Written By Kristin Spradlin \nIn the smartphone world where smartphones sporting larger screen sizes have somewhat become a standard, Samsung has now come up with a 4-inch entry-level smartphone called the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini Prime. Though the device has not officially announced by Samsung yet, it now appears that both Amazon and eBay have now the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime listed on their site in the US. \nThe unlocked Galaxy J1 Mini Prime is now available for purchase in the US from online retailers Amazon and eBay; on Amazon, the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime costs $89.99 while a top seller on eBay is offering the device at a retail price of $86.99. Speaking of the device, the Samsung Galaxy J1 Mini Prime is somewhat a smaller version of the Galaxy J1 Prime , which was launched back in January this year, but it features a more recent version of the software compared to the Galaxy J1 Prime, while other hardware is mostly similar, save for the screen size, SoC and battery capacity. Talking about the specifications, the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime features a 4-inch TFT display with a 480 × 800 resolution which works out to a 233 PPI pixel density. Powering the device up is a Spreadtrum SC9830 quad-core SoC with 4x A7 cores running at 1.2 GHz clock speed, while graphics are handled by the Mali 400MP2 GPU. The device packs 1 GB of RAM and has 8 GB of onboard storage and supports microSD cards to further expand the storage (up to 256 GB). For the optics, the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime features a 5.0-megapixel sensor on the back side with an f/2.2 aperture and an LED flash, while a VGA camera is placed on the front side of the device. To keep the show running, a non-removable 1,500 mAh battery is also included in this package. Connectivity wise, the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime supports Wi-Fi 802.11 b/g/n, Wi-Fi Direct, Bluetooth v4.0 with A2DP, GPS and operates on 2G/3G networks, sadly there is no LTE support. \nThe Galaxy J1 Mini Prime comes running Android 6.0 Marshmallow version out-of-the-box with Samsung’s TouchWiz interface on top. If you’re residing in the US, and interested in picking up the Galaxy J1 Mini Prime, hit the link below.",

      "text": "echo \nAmazon , in addition to being among the world’s most popular online retailers, has made a few efforts to branch off and create its own hardware to varying degrees of success. The smart home speaker system, Amazon Echo, has been a big hit for the company and a new report is coming out that suggests that we may soon see a brand new Alexa-powered speaker complete with a large touchscreen. \nJoin us after the break for the details. \nTo recap a bit here, Alexa is the name of Amazon’s voice-controlled digital assistant, similar to Apple’s Siri and the Google Assistant . Asking questions in regards to the weather, calendar appointments, top headlines, etc will result in Alexa speaking the information back. With Amazon Echo and Alexa, you can also play music from Amazon Music, Spotify, among others, as well as control various smart home devices such as lights or thermostats. \nAmazon certainly was not the first company to develop its own voice-enabled AI system, but when Amazon Echo was introduced back in 2014, it became quite the surprise hit especially when you consider how much of a flop its Android-based Fire Phone was. Smart speakers and AI platforms are increasing in popularity with Google Assistant now found in a few of Google’s products such as the new Google Home smart speaker, which is a direct competitor to Amazon Echo. Samsung is also expected to announce its own AI-based system called Bixby . \nAccording to a new report on Bloomberg , Amazon may be in development of a new Alexa-powered speaker, but more in the form of a tablet complete with a 7-inch touchscreen. Not much is known currently about this product, and so it is currently unclear if Amazon will still market this device within the “smart home speaker” category or if it will be a full-fledged tablet that also has Alexa built-in at the system level. The report indicates a new version of Fire OS will power the device. \nThere are certainly benefits to introducing a touchscreen to a smart speaker. The hands-free voice approach, while very convenient, may not always be ideal as adding visuals can result in a much more immersive and information-rich experience. Or even more simply, sometimes you may just not want to use your voice. \nSince this possible device will be running Fire OS, it wouldn’t be surprising to see it taking advantage of all the software features and apps that would currently be found on such a tablet. While an announcement may come as early as the first quarter of 2017, there is no information about the possible price of this device. However, given that Amazon Echo retails for $180, it’s very likely this touchscreen device will go for some amount higher than that. \nWe will keep an eye out for any updates. Does this sound like a device that interests you? Can Amazon offer a rich enough experience to sway you from other Android tablets or home speakers?

      "text": "Amazon \nAfter more than a year on the sidelines, Jeremy Clarkson is back with a new car show on Amazon Prime called \"The Grand Tour\".\nClarkson, along with long-time co-hosts Richard Hammond and James May, launched \"The Grand Tour\" prior to the Thanksgiving holiday to rave reviews.\nIn fact, the first episode quickly became the most watch piece of programming in the history of Amazon Prime.\nIncredibly, Amazon's second-best performing show could only muster 1/3 of \"The Grand Tour's\" ratings, The Wrap reported.\nRecently, the bombastic TV host and long-time newspaper columnist sat down with Business Insider in New York while doing press for his new show. We had a brief chat about supercars, electric cars, and why James May should feel small and stupid.\nBenjamin Zhang : Let's talk about cars. One of our favorites this year has been the new Acura/Honda NSX. \nJeremy Clarkson : I'm annoyed to have to say that James May has driven it for the show, Richard Hammond has been in it, and I've only been looking at it. I've haven't had a go in it, not yet, but I will very soon\nIt's a very good looking car, I just hope its better than Honda's Formula One effort. (In reference to Honda's recent struggles as McLaren's engine supplier in the Formula One racing series.)\nAmazon BZ : In the past you haven't been a huge of fan of Tesla. Has your thinking changed at all?\nJC : No, because I will never be a fan plug-in electric cars. You have brown-outs in New York already when you have people charging (phones) up, and running lights. America is barely coping with its demand for electricity. Same in Britain. We're 5% and you're 16% under here in the US. So, when people start charging their cars up, where's the power going to come?\nWho knows.\nYou'll have to build more power stations. Is that environmentally friendly?\nThe answer is hydrogen. But the more plug-in electric cars that come along, the less demand there is for carmakers to get off their asses and start making fuel cell cars — which is where we must go. We must have fuel cell cars. The world has to have them.\nBZ : Back to something more traditional. What are your thoughts on the new Ferrari 488 GTB? Is it an awesome car or a turbocharged abomination?\nJC : The 488 is fabulous car — make no mistake about that. And anyone who owns a 458 ( The 488's predecessor) now would feel small and stupid because they bought the wrong car... James May.\nAmazon BZ : Yes, James May was extolling the merits of his Ferrari 458 Speciale earlier today.\nJC : Yes I know, he's the man who once drove it 26 mph. He'd certainly never go any faster than that.\nFerrari— difficult company to deal with, but extremely good cars when you get ahold of them. They are really, really good. In fact, I know of nothing, really, as a driver's machine that gets close to that.\nBZ : What about McLaren?\nJC :  It does, but it's got these extremely clever electronic roll bars and matches Ferrari in terms of all of the outright figures. But I don't know. There's a fizz , James May calls it, (that you feel) when you drive a Ferrari. I know what he means and you just don't get that from a McLaren. The spirit of (long-time McLaren boss and well-known neat-freak) Ron Dennis is in every single thing you touch in there.\nBZ : Not for much longer I guess.\nJC : Yes, I know and that's slightly amazing. (Dennis was removed from is position of McLaren Technology Group's CEO last month)\nThere's this slightly antiseptic feel to the (McLaren). You know when you see someone with really neat hair and you want to lean over and just do that . (Clarkson stretches his arm out and pretends to mess up my hair.) It's what you want to do to a McLaren. You want to just rub mud on its face. It would make the car better and more human.\nAmazon BZ : On that note, what do you think of the new generation Audi A4?\nJC : I haven't bothered with it. The last Audi I drove was the TT, which was excellent. I drive a different car every week, why the bloody hell would I make one of them an A4.\nBZ : Well, what about American cars? Have they gotten any better in your opinion?\nJC : Yeah, much better. The new Corvettes are truly fantastic. You couldn't possibly have one in Europe because you'd look like a moron. But, it's a fabulous car. In fact, the last two generations have been extremely impressive.\nBZ : Even for everyday road use?\nJC : Yeah. Very very good. And I'd also say that, for the same exact reasons I was discussing with you on the McLaren, the Mustang is also a really good car.\nWe a drove the Roush one in the opening scene (of the first episode) and that was a really good car.\nAmazon BZ : You had a (Henrik Fisker-designed, modified Mustang) Rocket as well right?\nJC : Yeah, but the Roush was better. The Roush was the best of those three.\nBZ : Even better than the Shelby GT350?\nJC : I thought so. The last Roush I drove — based on the last model Mustang — was (on the track) at Willow Springs. I was just absolutely bowled over by it. Roush are really good. Never met them. Don't even know who they are or where they are, but I've driven two of their cars now and both of them have been incredibly impressive.\nBZ : Thank you very much.\nNOW WATCH: The cheapest new Ferrari money can buy is absolutely gorgeous \n",

      "text": "WPVI   07:36AM A Delaware County man is accused of stalking an Amazon delivery driver and trying to run from police.It started in Concord Township on Monday afternoon.The 26-year-old driver told police, a man in a red car followed him for several hours, yelling racial slurs and threatening him with a gun.State troopers tracked 53-year-old Joseph Keenan to his house on Andrien Road in Glen Mills later that night.And that's when they say Keenan took off.Neighbor Paula Box said, \"I heard the screeching of brakes, the car going fast. We heard this big bang. And I looked out the door, and the police car was this way, and the man's car was this way. They were on the lawn across the street.\"Officers took Keenan into custody.

      "text": "Share \nECommerce giant Amazon said it had its best holiday weekend in its corporate history, as measured by sales of devices. The firm said that millions of pieces of hardware were sold across the weekend, beginning with Thanksgiving and continuing into Cyber Monday. \nAs reported by Investor’s Business Daily , the firm said that the Echo Dot, the Fire Tablet and the Amazon Echo were the best-selling goods across any manufacturer available on its website. The sales figures were not specified by the firm, just general trends across those devices. The total sales were more than double last year, and in terms of larger data, retailers sold $3.4 billion online on Cyber Monday alone, up 12 percent from last year, while Black Friday saw $3.3 billion in sales within the United States, up 21.6 percent year over year. \nEven as online sales rose, RetailNext reported that foot traffic-related sales fell 5 percent year over year, with a 7.9 percent decline in transactions.",
