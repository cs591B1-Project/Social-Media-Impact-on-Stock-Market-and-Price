      "text": "Abortion and immigration were the most-searched topics on Election Day in connection with presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump , according to Google.\nGoogle News Lab shows that abortion was the top policy issue included in searches of Clinton's name and the number two issue included in searches of Trump's name.\nThe data underscore arguments by opponents of abortion that it is a motivating issue for voters, although many 2016 polls have found abortion to be less important to voters than many other topics such as the economy, terrorism and foreign policy.\n\"The abortion issue has consistently been on voters' minds this election,\" Susan B. Anthony List President Marjorie Dannenfelser said. \"In the days leading up to the election, abortion has been the top issue voters are searching for related to both candidates.\"\nStay abreast of the latest developments from nation's capital and beyond with curated News Alerts from the Washington Examiner news desk and delivered to your inbox.\nSorry, there was a problem processing your email signup.

Dannenfelser's group, which seeks to elect abortion-opposing female candidates to office, said Tuesday it spent $18 million during this election cycle, garnered 19.6 million online ad impressions and sent canvassers to 1.1 million homes. The group invested in four key Senate races in Florida, North Carolina, Missouri and Ohio and in trying to re-elect Utah Rep. Mia Love.\nDannenfelser also headed a coalition of anti-abortion advocates supporting Trump. While the Republican presidential nominee has given Dannenfelser and others pause for his previous statements supporting abortion rights and his attitudes toward women, he won their applause in the final presidential debate when he slammed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for supporting late-term abortion rights.\nAbortion was the top-searched policy issue in all the Midwestern states and some central-northern and Southern states, while immigration had the most searches in states along the East and West coasts, according to Google. The economy was the most-searched term in two states, New Mexico and Vermont.\nTop Story GOP projected to keep House, Republicans looks to speaker's race \nRepublicans were on track to keep their House majority Tuesday, making their next mission the re-election of House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis.\nProjections as of 8:40 p.m. Tuesday said Republicans would keep their majority, although they were still expected to lose some seats.\nNo one expected Republicans to lose control of the House, but their diminished numbers means governing could be tougher given the ongoing split within the conference between anti-establishment and mainstream lawmakers.\nA first test of that will be choosing a speaker. The slimmer majority could have the effect of making it easier for Ryan to hold onto the gavel, since the GOP can only afford so many defections before giving away the speaker's slot to\nBy Nicole Duran • 11/08/16 8:44  ",

      "text": "Reddit \nAs removable batteries become a thing of the past, consumers, and even manufacturers, are left with a few fixes to address battery anxiety, from larger batteries in fatter phones, to power banks, to fast charging technologies. That last one, however, might soon be a rather complicated matter on Android. In the updated Android Compatibility Definition Document, Google is discouraging the use of non-standard third-party quick charging technologies for USB Type-C devices, even suggesting that, in the future, those might be completely banned from the platform. \nIt might sound like a damning piece of requirement but, in truth, Google is only addressing a very specific situation: fast charging over USB-C. Here is the full text of section 7.7.1 of the document: \n“Type-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers.” \nWhile not naming names, this basically covers Qualcomm’s Quick Charge technology, which has been around far longer than the USB-C standard, but also ropes in MediaTek’s Pump Express, and OnePlus’ DASH Charge, among other technologies. \nAdmittedly, the charging situation with USB-C is both messy and precarious. USB-C does have its own fast charging standard named Power Delivery. In most cases, the implementation of these technologies are incompatible, leading to downright dangerous situations. It still remains to be seen how OEMs and chip makers like Qualcomm and MediaTek will respond to this wording, but Google is setting its foot down in order to help push USB-C Power Delivery forward. It doesn’t say anything against the likes of Quick Charge for older USB types. \nThe new Compatibility Definition Document, now updated for Android 7.0, also has a few interesting tidbits. Most curious is perhaps the idea of Android Extensions, which seems to be designed to allow newer features to be backported to older Android versions. \nWhile the Compatibility Definition Document is a requirement for devices to be compatible with Android, the platform’s open source nature still leaves room for modification or disregard of those recommendations and requirements. That said, OEMs will have to play by Google’s rules if they want to remain within the good graces of Google.",

It adds:\nOnce Safe Browsing has determined that a site is a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be unable to request additional reviews via the Search Console for 30 days, and warnings will continue to show to users. When a site is established as a Repeat Offender, the webmaster will be notified via email to their registered Search Console email address.\nGoogle adds that the label will not be used for websites that are hacked and then get turned into malicious pages, via a third-party hacker, before being restored.

      "title": "How does the pill work? You asked Google - here’s the answer | Holly Grigg-Spall | Opinion",
      "text": "T he pill was the first drug to be created and prescribed for healthy people. Oral contraceptives became available in 1961 and within a decade were so ubiquitous as to gain the pet name of “the pill”. Fast-forward to the present: 100 million women will take a form of the pill today, right after brushing their teeth or before they go to bed. In fact, 80% of women will use oral contraceptives at some point during their lives. Many women now start taking the pill during their teens and continue taking it, every day, for several decades. The pill has become such a normalised, commonplace part of women’s daily routine that it’s easy to forget that the pill is actually a powerful medication. But all of us, at some point, will want to know: “How does the pill work?”\nThe pill is made up of a synthetic estrogen and synthetic progesterone (known as progestin). These synthetic hormones are not the same as the hormones produced by the female body. The pill actually stops the production of those endogenous hormones via the brain. It suppresses the creation and fluctuation of hormones that make up the menstrual cycle and replaces that cycle with an artificial, flat stream of synthetic hormones. The body stops producing its own hormones and the pill acts as hormone replacement.\nCould an algorithm replace the pill? Read more \nThis process switches off the ovaries, preventing ovulation (the release of the egg from the ovary). The pill also prevents the production of fertile cervical fluid (essential for sperm to reach the egg). Plus, the lining of the uterus does not grow thicker (this uterine lining is what would usually, in an unmedicated cycle, become your period). This is the three-fold action by which the pill prevents pregnancy. Although women are only able to get pregnant on six days per menstrual cycle , the pill is taken every day to ensure infertility.\nThe usual language used for describing how the pill works is too often a mix of half-truths, platitudes, and a simple fudging of the facts. Understanding how the female body works when not on the pill can help us understand how the pill works. However, the female body and reproductive health have long been after-thoughts in science, as in our society. As a result, the pill has become both a product and a proponent of a sexist set-up, creating a gap in knowledge that gets filled with a host of medical myths.\nFor example, you may have heard that the pill “regulates” periods. The pill doesn’t manage the menstrual cycle, it replaces it, and therefore the pill does not “regulate” the menstrual cycle . When women take the pill, they do not experience a cycle or periods. When they take a break from the pill once a month or take the placebo/sugar pills and bleed, this is not menstruation. The bleed experienced on the pill is a “withdrawal bleed” (your body is withdrawing from the synthetic hormones) and very different from a physiological period.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Why birth control can never regulate periods \nEarly pill researchers decided to create the break week (or the few days of placebo pills) to allow women to experience a bleed each month. At the time, it was considered a good sales tactic to design the pill packs this way; they thought women would be concerned by not bleeding month-in-month-out and, as such, would be reluctant to take the pill. Today you’ll often hear that there is no medical reason to have “periods” on the pill. What is meant is that there’s no medical reason to have “withdrawal bleeds” on the pill, and that’s precisely because the bleeds on the pill are not real periods . Withdrawal bleeds are an inessential design feature of the pill, but actual menstruation is different. There are many good medical reasons to have a period – in fact, the American Committee of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends women view their periods as “ the fifth vital sign ” of health .\nPart of the mythology that surrounds the pill is the idea that menstruation is unnatural. This developed from the “paleofantasy” of one doctor . He assumed that, because paleolithic women did not experience many periods in a lifetime (presuming they were pregnant often, breastfeeding, and then, of course, dying very young) in comparison to modern-day women, it is therefore more “natural” for women today to not have a menstrual cycle. It is more natural, he reasons, for them to be on hormonal birth control. So, the theory is that the pill takes women back to our presumed “natural” state of constant pregnancy and breastfeeding (no ovulation, no periods).\nThe pill is linked to depression – and doctors can no longer ignore it | Holly Grigg-Spall Read more \nBut it’s just a theory, without evidence, as we cannot know what occurred pre-science, or pre-society for that matter. Anyway, the pill does not actually mimic pregnancy; what happens to the body on the pill is more like a chemically induced menopause. The pregnancy hormones are estradiol, estriol and progesterone, which give many benefits. The pill contains ethinylestradiol and a synthetic progestin (like levonorgestrel or drospirenone, for example, as there are many kinds), which do not give the same benefits , and actually have many of the opposite effects.\nRather than questioning if a biological function is “natural”, it makes more sense to investigate whether it is important for good health. It’s interesting to note that there are few functions of the male body we consider obsolete, unnecessary, or unnatural. I’ve yet to hear a doctor make the argument that men might actually ejaculate too much, and as such should avoid ejaculation (preferably with ejaculation-preventive drugs), unless it’s for the purpose of conceiving a child.\nThe connection between the menstrual cycle and women’s health is not theory, but scientific fact. The menstrual cycle and ovulation, specifically female biology, allows women to get pregnant and give birth, but that’s not its only reason for being. Menstruation and ovulation are two connected parts of the same biological system . That we ask “do women need periods?” rather than “do women need to ovulate?” reveals that theorising around the necessity of menstruation is always wrapped up in the culture of period shaming and taboo.\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Vagina Dispatches: Stopping Periods \nLong-term, ovulation is connected to good bone, heart, and breast health . Short term, ovulation is connected to energy levels, libido, mood, creativity, partner choice, and more than 150 other essential biological functions, from memory to sense of smell to nutrient absorption. While we usually ask, “What are the side-effects of taking the pill?”, we could ask: “What are the benefits of having a menstrual cycle?” Ovulation and the hormones produced via ovulation, their levels and fluctuations, are intricately connected to the workings of the immune, metabolic, and endocrine system .\nThis information can help build our understanding of why the pill has so many adverse effects, with just a sampling of recent research revealing that it alters the structure of the brain , triggers Crohn’s disease , and increases the risk of depression .\nWhen will my periods start? You asked Google – here’s the answer | Rose George Read more \nThe pill has to disrupt the endocrine system in order to stop the production of endogenous hormones. The hypothalamus, the pituitary gland – the brain’s control centre for hormones – is what the pill overrides to prevent pregnancy. When we hear the term “endocrine disruptor” it’s normally in relation to other environmental toxins. In the last year nail polish, fire-retardant sofas, receipts, pesticides and household cleaners have all made the headlines for having endocrine disruptive properties and, therefore, carcinogenic and disease-causing consequences. The pill is an endocrine disruptor by design .\nDuring the early days of research for my book on the pill , I interviewed a GP. I asked him why women are so rarely told how the pill works at the time that this discussion would be most relevant: in the doctor’s office before getting the prescription. I often think of his response, which was: “‘Why wouldn’t you be satisfied with just knowing it stops you producing eggs so you don’t get pregnant?” I knew why I wasn’t satisfied, because that wasn’t all that the pill did for me – it also caused debilitating physical and psychological side-effects. It hadn’t occurred to this GP that some women experience side-effects on the pill and want to know why and how this happens; or that some want to know more about a medication they’re putting in their (healthy) body every day; or that some think any behaviour expected of only women, and never men, is always worthy of our attention.",

Other related searches included “moving to Canada if Trump wins” and “celebrities moving to Canada.” Advertisement \nCoincidentally, at the same time, Canada’s immigration website was giving users errors, unable to load. \nAccording to the website isitdownrightnow.com, the Canadian immigration website had been down for about 13 minutes as of 12:13 a.m. Wednesday.

      "text": "\nBy Aimee Ortiz Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nThe Canadian immigration website went down Tuesday night while Google searches for “moving to Canada” surged as Donald Trump won key battleground states like Florida, opening a wide path to the White House for the GOP nominee.\nAt 11:48 p.m., the phrase peaked in Google search. Other related searches included “moving to Canada if Trump wins” and “celebrities moving to Canada.”\nAdvertisement\nCoincidentally, at the same time, Canada’s immigration website was giving users errors, unable to load.\nAccording to the website isitdownrightnow.com, the Canadian immigration website had been down for about 13 minutes as of 12:13 a.m. Wednesday.\nGet Political Happy Hour in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The website crash and search surge occurred as Trump held onto his tight lead over Clinton in the popular vote, and continued to gain in the Electoral College.\nEarlier in the night, the Canada’s official Twitter account tweeted out a message about immigrants in Canada.\n“In Canada, immigrants are encouraged to bring their cultural traditions with them and share them with their fellow citizens,” the message read, causing some on the social network to speculate about the tweet’s timing.\nI don't think the timing of this tweet was random... Canada's most passive-aggressive tweet to date. https://t.co/njxqqLNMI0\n— Stephanie VanderLeek (@mrsvleek) November 9, 2016 @Canada do you mean Americans too?\n— Stephen Whyno (@SWhyno) November 9, 2016 @Canada when Canada knows they're about to get a lot of Americans\n— keyshawn (@omgkeyshawn) November 9, 2016 @Canada We coming and we bringing Obama\n— jackie (@modd25) November 9, 2016 Advertisement\nThe Google search phrase also peaked during the week of Super Tuesday in March.\nAimee Ortiz can be reached at aimee.ortiz@globe.com .

      "text": "Google slaps 'repeat offender' tag on unsafe sites Incorrigible Safe Browsing violators now get flagged for 30 days. Share Save \nGoogle is closing a loophole in its Safe Browsing search policy. While it already flags sites that violate its malware, phishing and other policies, bad actors can temporary halt those activities. Then, once the warnings are removed, they resume, and unsuspecting searchers are none the wiser. Starting today, however, Google is flagging such sites as \"repeat offenders,\" and webmasters won't be able to appeal the warnings for 30 days. \nHacked websites will not be classified as repeat offenders; \"only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy,\" Google notes. There's nothing stopping you from clicking on a link anyway, of course, but a Google Search warning will no doubt dissuade a lot of users. In addition, Google Chrome will put up another warning page that will probably convince the majority of users to not enter a dangerous site. \nGoogle's Safe Search no doubt stops a lot of hacking, and the new policy will help. What's really needed is a way to stop or limit the damage from email phishing attacks , however. Those have caused some of the largest breeches on the internet, reportedly including the hack of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta.",

      "text": "Android Nougat Compatibility Document Attempts to Reduce Hardware, Software Fragmentation Google releases guidelines for Android manufacturers to follow each year Android Nougat guidelines target fragmentation in hardware & software Manufacturers have to follow these to get access to core Google apps \nThe Android Compatibility Definition Document (or CDD) has been a set of rules and guidelines that manufacturers need to follow if they want their Android devices to work with Google’s core suite of apps, including Google Play. In the past, Google has used the CDD to ensure manufacturers do not modify certain crucial features the company has baked into new versions of Android. For example, last year it prevented makers to tamper with the Doze feature on Android 6.0 . Now, Google has released a new version of the document for devices that intend to run their latest Android 7.0 Nougat operating system, that was released this August . Although the 85-page document is laden with many technicalities, some of the interested ones were discovered by publications. For instance, Android Police reports the requirement to unify functioning of inline remotes present on earphones that connect to the 3.5mm headphone jack. The rule states that 3.5mm jacks in Android phones that intend to run Nougat must recognise and perform consistent actions when the volume up, volume down or the button in the middle typically used to end calls is clicked. This check will ensure manufacturers do not meddle the actions as per their free will, which can cause incompatibilities between the inline remote buttons and devices. Although a step in the right direction, one cannot overlook the push in the industry to drop 3.5mm jacks from phones altogether, lead by phones like the LeEco Le 2 , the Moto Z and the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus .\nThe bigger change though may soon prevent manufacturers from implementing their own variation of fast charging methods in Android phones. Currently, Qualcomm’s Quick Charge may be the most commonly used standard, but other standards like Oppo’s VOOC and OnePlus’ Dash Charging also exist among others. This obstructs chargers of one manufacturer to fast charge a phone of another, in some cases. To make matters worse, there are already incompatibilities among USB Type-C cables. Google used the USB Power Delivery standard on last years’ Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P as well as Pixel phones this year. At this point, Google is “strongly recommending” devices with USB Type-C ports to not support proprietary charging methods, thereby maintaining compatibility with USB Power Delivery Standard. It also states that in the future it might become a compulsory requirement, thereby pushing for a future where any USB C charger can efficiently charge any USB C device. \nNext, multi-window mode is a feature that Android phone makers like Samsung have implemented for many years now, with Google finally introducing its variation in Nougat. Google is now asking manufacturers not to tamper with its implementation. 9to5Google reports that although this is a mandatory requirement, manufacturers can choose not to implement multi-window altogether, which may be the case if the device has a screen to small and/or hardware too underpowered to use the function properly. \nOther notable changes include a mandatory support for call blocking, and a way for Google to bypass manufacturers and carriers to push API updates, dubbed Android Extensions. You can read the entire document in PDF form stored on Android’s official site.",

      "text": "Some Google Pixel Phone Users Reporting Issues With LTE Connectivity Several Pixel phone users reporting connectivity issue Many affected users are on LTE band 4 Few users from other bands was also affected \nAfter Bluetooth pairing issues , Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL phone users are now complaining of connectivity issues, particularly on the LTE band 4 frequency. Users across the world are reporting LTE signal issues on their Pixel phones. \nWhile users on different bands are reporting issues, the most complaints are generated from LTE band 4 (FDD-LTE, 1700MHz) users. It is worth noting that users in some areas of North and South America rely solely on LTE band 4 for connectivity. Android Police also found out that T-Mobile users were not facing any such issues, indicating that the LTE band 4 issue was exclusive to specific networks. After speaking to a representative, a user noted that Google was aware about the issue and was working on it. The rep claimed that an update was in the works, and it would solve the connectivity issue once installed.\nPixel phones came in the wrong limelight last month for having difficulty in pairing with car systems. The Bluetooth pairing was glitchy at best, and disconnected unexpectedly and repeatedly. Recently, Google was also blamed for wrongly attributing that the phones charge at 18W speed. It was found out that the base Pixel variant maxes out at 15W , forcing Google to clarify that the Pixel phones support USB-PD charging between 15-18W.",

      "title": "Google demands standard in-line headphone controls for Nougat devices",
      "text": "\nGoogle gives Android away to OEMs for free. But gaining access to Google’s suite of apps – especially the Google Play Store – comes at a cost. That cost is met by satisfying the demands of the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CCD) , the latest of which has just been released for Android 7.0 Nougat, a full two and a half months after Nougat was released.\nThe CCD has a lot of interesting tidbits in it, but some are likely to be of greater concern than others. For example, Google has hinted that it may start forcing OEMs to support fast charging via USB Power Delivery (which the Pixel phones use) in future Android versions. In many ways, this is a good thing: universal fast charger compatibility across all Android devices. So far, so good.\nThe same goes for audio standards and in-line headphone controls. The CCD has a couple of sections on audio, the first of which dictates that devices claiming “professional audio” playback must satisfy the standards laid out in the OpenSL ES for Android reference document. Again, a little consistency never hurt anyone.\nGoogle is clearly trying to minimize the amount of arbitrary differentiation in audio standards on Android Nougat devices.\nNext up are analog audio ports, which, as you know, are slowly becoming an endangered species. According to the CCD, if a device has a 3.5 mm audio jack, the system must support three basic in-line headphone controls: volume up, volume down and headsethook (which allows you to answer and hang up calls).\nJust to be clear, the CCD demands that “if a device implementation includes one or more analog audio ports, at least one of the audio port(s) SHOULD be a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack.” This means including a 3.5 mm port is entirely optional, but if a device does have a 3.5 mm port, it must meet Google’s parameters for in-line controls.\n7.8.2.1. Analog Audio Ports \nIf a device implementation has a 4 conductor 3.5mm audio jack, it:\nMUST support the detection and mapping to the keycodes for the following 3 ranges of equivalent impedance between the microphone and ground conductors on the audio plug: 70 ohm or less : KEYCODE_HEADSETHOOK\n210-290 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_UP\n360-680 Ohm : KEYCODE_VOLUME_DOWN\nSTRONGLY RECOMMENDED to detect and map to the keycode for the following range of equivalent impedance between the microphone and ground conductors on the audio plug: 110-180 Ohm: KEYCODE_VOICE_ASSIST\n\nIt must be said that a lot of OEMs already support in-line headphone controls and volume up, down and pickup/hang up are pretty standard. But by laying out the specific impedance values for each setting, Google is enforcing a degree of consistency on what has previously been left up to OEMs. The result of this has been headphones whose in-line controls don’t work on all phones.\nStandardized headphone controls, combined with the prospect of uniform fast charger adaptor compatibility in future, are definitely steps in the right direction. While Android is and should continue to be a free and open platform, reducing the amount of arbitrary differentiation on Android devices makes a lot of sense. And Google is the only one that can make it happen.\nWhat other compatibility issues would you like to see addressed in Android?",

      "text": "Nick Gray Nov 9th, 2016 \nWith most flagship phones sporting batteries with 3,000 mAh or more, proprietary rapid charging technologies have allowed users to top off their smartphones surprisingly fast. Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 standard is fairly fast, but Huawei, Oppo, and other manufacturers have proprietary charging standards which can charge smartphone batteries even faster. With USB Type-C quickly becoming the dominant port standard for new devices, the new Android 7.0 CDD shows that Google doesn’t want manufacturer messing with the USB Type-C charging standard . \nType-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers. \nFor now, Google isn’t prohibiting smartphone manufacturers from using Qualcomm’s Quick Charge or other proprietary charging technologies, but the last sentence is a bit ominous – warning that the recommendation may become a requirement in the future. The basic USB Type-C charging standard is a lot faster than what we’ve experienced with microUSB over the years, but it’s significantly slower than the rapid charging technologies that manufacturers have equipped their flagship phones with over the past year or two. \nWe understand that Google wants to level the playing field and remove any interoperability issues between devices and chargers. However, consumers and manufacturers shouldn’t be shackled by Google’s vision of universal interoperability.",

      "text": "\nBy the numbers: What a phone needs to run high-performance VR content.\nWe know Google's Daydream VR experience, introduced in Nougat , requires some pretty beefy technology to run, but so far the exact hardware and software requirements have eluded us. They're now laid bare in the new Android 7.0 Compatibility Definition Document , which shows in great detail the criteria a phone must meet in order to run in \"high performance\" VR mode.\nThe documents go into fine detail on exact numbers to do with display latency, video capabilities as well as OpenGL features, but the condensed version is basically as follows:\nBluetooth 4.2 LE Between 4.7 and 6 inches At least 1080p @ 60Hz display with 3ms or less latency and 5ms or less persistence. (Quad HD resolution or higher recommended.) OpenGL ES 3.2 and Vulkan Able to decode 2 instances of 60fps video simultaneously Consistent 60fps rendering Temperature sensors capable of reading device surface temperature This doesn't exactly make it simple to work out if a phone will support Daydream based on a spec sheet alone, since properties like display latency aren't shown in your average spec sheet. (Kind of a moot point as Daydream-ready devices are advertised as such.) Nevertheless, it's interesting to see the exact numbers Google's holding device manufacturers to.\nIt's interesting to note that the just-launched Huawei Mate 9 just about meets the spec with its 5.9-inch 1080p display, whereas a smaller, higher-res phone might not be Daydream-ready because of the display latency or sensor requirements.\nIn any case, the only Daydream-ready phones you can actually buy right now are the Google Pixel and Pixel XL \nAndroid 7.0 Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat: Everything you need to know Will my phone get Android Nougat?

      "text": "\nWe finally know what Daydream VR-ready actually means.\nGoogle recently updated the Android Compatibility Definition Document (CDD) for Android 7.0 Nougat. There are quite a few interesting changes, including some that point to consistent in-line controls for headphones , tweaks to the Android update model , and a potential ban of third-party charging standards .\nDon’t miss: Daydream VR: everything you need to know \nAnother provision of the document finally lays out the requirements that a smartphone must meet in order to be deemed Daydream VR-ready. While highly technical, these specifications give us an idea of what devices will work with Google’s new mobile VR standard.\nDaydream VR-ready phones:\nMUST have at least 2 physical cores. MUST support sustained performance mode. MUST support Vulkan Hardware Level 0 and SHOULD support Vulkan Hardware Level 1. MUST support H.264 decoding at least 3840 x 2160 @ 30fps-40Mbps. MUST support HEVC and VP9, MUST be capable to decode at least 1920 x 1080 @ 30 fps-10Mbps and SHOULD be capable to decode 3840 x 2160 @ 30fps-20Mbps (equivalent to 4 instances of 1920 x 1080 @ 30fps-5Mbps). STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to support android.hardware.sensor.hifi_sensors feature and MUST meet the gyroscope, accelerometer, and magnetometer related requirements for android.hardware.hifi_sensors MUST have an embedded screen, and its resolution MUST be at least be Full HD (1080p) and STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to be Quad HD (1440p) or higher MUST measure between 4.7″ and 6″ diagonal MUST update at least 60 Hz while in VR Mode The display latency on Gray-to-Gray, White-to-Black, and Black-to-White switching time MUST be ≤ 3 ms The display MUST support a low-persistence mode with ≤5 ms persistence Device implementations MUST support Bluetooth 4.2 and Bluetooth LE Data Length Extension. The full list of requirements is available here . A quick note on verbiage: “MUST” means that the requirement is mandatory, while “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED” and “SHOULD” mean that Google allows manufacturers to go against its recommendations.\nThe situation is a bit fuzzy when it comes to the processor requirements. While ZTE announced this summer that the Axon 7 (powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 820) is Daydream VR ready, Qualcomm later stated that only Snapdragon 821 supports Daydream VR. Vulkan 1.0 support alone doesn’t guarantee compatibility, as Samsung’s S7 and S7 Edge support Vulkan, but are not Daydream VR-ready as far as we know.\n\nGoogle doesn’t specifically demand an OLED display in the CDD, but the need for low latency and persistency probably means that only phones with OLED panels will make the cut. That could increase even further the demand for AMOLED displays, which is already on the rise and expected to boom in 2017. On the flipside, Full HD devices are supported, though Google would obviously prefer the denser Quad HD.\nSo far, if you want a Daydream VR-ready device, the safest bets are the Google Pixel and Pixel XL and the ZenFone 3 Deluxe with Snapdragon 821. There are other Snapdragon 821 devices out there, but they haven’t been officially confirmed to work with Daydream VR headsets like Google’s Daydream View. Speaking of that, the View will ship tomorrow, so there’s a good chance that Google will shed light on the matter very soon.\nThis post was originally published on VRSource.com . ",

      "text": "Google doesn't want proprietary fast charging in Android phones It might even require strict support of USB-C chargers in later versions. Share Save \nGoogle isn't a fan of non-standard approaches to fast-charging Android phones over USB-C, and it's bent on having manufacturers fall in line. Its newest Android Compatibility Definition document (for Android Nougat) now says it's \"strongly recommended\" that device makers don't support proprietary charging technology that modifies voltages beyond standard levels, or otherwise creates \"interoperability issues\" with standard USB charging. In other words, tech like Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is likely considered naughty. On top of that, the company warns that later versions of Android might even require full interoperability with standard chargers. \nThis doesn't mean that you won't see fast charging. Remember, both of Google's Pixel phones can top up quickly. However, it's evident that Google would like to fulfill USB-C's promise of cables and chargers that always work together . It doesn't like the idea that you might have to carry a specific charger for your phone to work as expected, or that a flaky cable might fry your charger, phone or both. The company might never force vendors to drop their preferred fast charging standards, but it certainly won't look kindly on them.",

      "text": "Run Time: Rosario Dawson, Kurt Russell, Zoë Bell, Rose McGowan, Vanessa Ferlito Run Time: 113 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"For Austin's hottest DJ, Jungle Julia (Sydney Tamiia Poitier), dusk offers an opportunity to unwind with two of her closest friends, Shanna and Arlene (Jordan Ladd and Vanessa Ferlito). This three fox posse sets out into the night, turning heads from Guero's to the Texas Chili Parlor. Not all of the attention is innocent: Covertly tracking their moves is Stuntman Mike (Kurt Russell), a scarred, weathered rebel who leers from behind the wheel of his muscle car. As the girls settle into their beers, Mike's weapon, a white-hot juggernaut, revs just feet away.\" \nHonestly, what is cooler than a serial killer stuntman slaughtering people with his \"death proof\" car? How about a group of badass ladies who decide they're not taking his sh*t? Go watch this one right now! 'I Am Not a Serial Killer'(2016) It takes one to know one... Director: Billy O'Brien Stars: Christopher Lloyd, Laura Fraser, Max Records Run Time: 103 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"Sixteen-year-old John Wayne Cleaver (Max Records, Where the Wild Things Are) is not a serial killer -- but he has all the makings of one. Keeping his homicidal tendencies and morbid obsessions with death and murder in check is a constant struggle that only gets harder when a real serial killer begins terrorizing his sleepy Midwestern town. Now, in order to track down a psychopath and protect those around him, John must unleash his darkest inner demons. Based on the cult novel by Dan Wells, this twisted, genre-bending thriller co-stars Christopher Lloyd and Breaking Bad's Laura Fraser.\" \nThis truly is a fresh take on the serial killer sub-genre of horror. Watch this one if you're in the mood for a horror movie that goes beyond just being a conventional horror movie by crossing over into drama as well. 'Scream' (1996) \"What's your favorite scary movie?\" Director: Wes Craven Stars: Neve Campbell, Courteney Cox, David Arquette Run Time: 110 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"After a series of mysterious deaths befalls their small town, an offbeat group of friends led by Sidney Prescott (Campbell) become the target of a masked killer in this smash-hit \"clever thriller\" (The Washington Post) that launched the Scream franchise and breathed new life into the horror genre.\" \nHands down one of the most memorable serial killer movies ever made. Scream brought the serial killer genre back to life with a unique story, lots of blood and killer cast a while being a parody of itself. Totally genius! 'A Nightmare on Elm Street' (1984) \"Whatever you do... don't fall asleep.\" Director: Wes Craven Stars: Heather Langenkamp, Johnny Depp, Robert Englund Run Time: 91 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"Can your nightmares be fatal? In this classic of the horror film genre that launched a movie franchise, a hideously scarred pedophile who was murdered by a lynch mob returns years later in the terrifying nightmares of his killers' teenage children — and the dreaming teenagers are starting to die in their sleep.\" \nAnother masterpiece from the mind of Wes Craven. This movie may be over 30 years old, but it is still terrifying to this day. Don't watch this one alone! 'Se7en' (1995) \"Yeah, just look at all the passion on that wall.\" Director: David Fincher Stars: Brad Pitt, Morgan Freeman, Gwyneth Paltrow, Kevin Spacey Run Time: 126 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"When city police find a murder victim who was somehow forced to die of overeating, it puts veteran Detective William Sommerset and his new, talented but still green partner, Detective David Mills, on a desperate hunt for a serial killer who is making statements by staging his victims as tableaus of the Seven Deadly Sins. The first corpse found was 'Gluttony,' and soon the detectives find more: a lawyer killed because of his Greed; an insurance scammer killed for his Sloth; a fashion model killed for her Pride. Each murder scene is elaborately planned, the victims chosen specifically because of who they are, and posed methodically in death. With time running out for the last two possible victims -- Envy and Wrath -- can Sommerset and Mills get ahead of the killer before his final two acts come to deadly fruition?\" \nThis is one of those movies that you can watch a hundred times while still appreciating it and discovering new details. A little disturbing at times, but should be on anyone's must-watch list (horror fans or not). 'High Tension' (2003) \"You can't escape from me, bitch!\" Director: Alexandre Aja Stars: Cécile De France, Maïwenn, Philippe Nahon Run Time: 89 minutes Google Play Synopsis: \"Two female students, Marie and Alex, set off to Alex's parent's secluded homestead in the country to relax and study. Come nightfall, Hell pulls up at the front door. Alex, bound and gagged, is taken away, with Marie left alluding the intruder. Can she save her friend's life in time? Or is everything all that it seems.\" \nThere is so much more than meets the eye in this French masterpiece. If you have a weak stomach, this may not be the movie for you. However, I challenge you to try to peel away the layers of this one because there are so many! \nWhich cinematic serial killer do you dread the most? Let us know in the comments below!

      "title": "Does Google's commitment to iOS make the iPhone a better buy?",
      "text": "\nA serious question.\nEarlier this week, Google released a redesigned version of its Gmail app for iOS , bringing it more in line with its Android equivalent. It's a big upgrade, and something that, after years of neglect, seemed a long time coming.\nBut it also brought back to life an argument that, for many people, the iPhone , with its impressive hardware, great camera(s), rich app ecosystem and, of course, iMessage, may be a better showcase for Google services than Android itself. Of course, many disagree, but the iPhone has a 44% market share in the U.S., and Apple maintains a lot of influence over the smartphone world.\nFor some Android faithful, Google's commitment to iOS development is confusing: why create great apps for a competing platform when you want people to buy Galaxys, Motos and, ideally, Pixels? Ultimately, Google wants your data, and wants to show you ads, and will do so wherever people are, and that is increasingly on iOS and Android.\n\nIndeed, the last couple of years has seen Google bring almost every notable app and service to Apple's platform, including long holdout Keep. If you look at Google's developer page on the App Store , it looks fairly similar to what you'd find on Android: YouTube, Maps, Chrome, Earth, Drive, Docs, Sheets, Hangouts, Photos, Calendar, Inbox, Books, Music, Movies, Wallet, Allo, Duo, Newsstand, Keep and plenty others. Even Google Search has its own app. What you won't find are apps that Apple doesn't allow, like an alternate dialler, or an unnecessary intervention like a camera app.\nThe last couple of years has seen Google bring almost every notable app and service to Apple's platform.\nYou'll also find apps like Gboard , a pretty great third-party iOS keyboard, that many people think should be ported over to Android in some form.\nIn all, Google has 80 apps to its name right now on iOS, slightly under Microsoft's 88 and nearly twice as many as Apple itself. This doesn't really mean anything other than Google is trying to make its most important services platform-independent, but it also brings up an important point: The prevailing tension between Android and iOS is far more about hardware than software, especially for someone entrenched in the Google ecosystem.\n\nThis is doubly true when looking at the sorry state of Android tablets , which we've been doing in the run-up to the holidays. While many Android users would be happy with a Pixel C , Yoga Book or Galaxy Tab S2, they would likely be just as happy, if not more so, with an iPad. An iPad that runs all of the above Google apps, plus hundreds of thousands of others for which care has been taken to optimize them for the larger screen.\nLots of us here at Android Central like the Google Pixel , which borrows more than a couple of pages out of the Apple playbook. It attempts to standardize elements of Android that were left to the interpretation of various third parties, and it introduces an environment where Google is comfortable offering exclusive services, like Assistant , that are not available to other hardware vendors. People use it as a pejorative, but it's true that in many ways the Pixel is the iPhone of the Android world.\nThe main argument I hear for wanting to stick with iPhone, even as an Android fan and a Google loyalist, is iMessage.\nThe main argument I hear for wanting to stick with iPhone, even as an Android fan and a Google loyalist, is iMessage. That Apple's closed-loop messaging service is hard to quit once you're in it — lock-in in the purest sense. Apple did a lot in iOS 10 to make iMessage more attractive and useful, but its success is also a source of frustration for many Android users left out of that experience.\nWhatsApp leads the charge for a cross-platform option, along with myriad other services from Kik to WeChat, but Google's own attempts to build a viable alternative to iMessage with Allo have fallen flat, and a push to introduce a more open platform built on top of existing SMS protocols will take time , and may never be a comprehensive solution.\nThe appeal of Android is considerably wider than just included Google services, though. Its success comes from the variability of the hardware — in size, form factor, material, color and, of course, price — and from inherent advantages to having an \"open\" platform. Despite the increasing similarities between the two platforms, Android — especially on Nougat — still handles notifications more elegantly, and there is an argument to be made that a universal share API is far more powerful on Android than it could ever be on iOS. The flexibility of on-screen navigation buttons alone speak to the myriad ongoing cultural differences between Android and iOS. For many people, that's enough to stay in the Android fold, and I wouldn't blame you if you never left. It's pretty nice down here.\nBut, playing Devil's Advocate for a moment, in a world where, increasingly, you can access the best of Google from anywhere, what would it take for you to switch to the iPhone?\nAndroid 7.0 Nougat Android 7.0 Nougat: Everything you need to know Will my phone get Android Nougat?

      "text": "Wednesday, November 09, 2016 Mohit Kumar Microsoft was very upset with Google last week when its Threat Analysis Group publically disclosed a critical Windows kernel vulnerability (CVE-2016-7255) that had yet to be patched. The company criticized Google's move , claiming that the disclosure of the vulnerability, which was being exploited in the wild, put its customers \"at potential risk.\" The vulnerability affects all Windows versions from Windows Vista through current versions of Windows 10, and Microsoft was set to issue a fix come this month's Patch Tuesday. So, as part of its monthly Patch Tuesday, Microsoft today patched the security flaw in Windows that was actively being exploited by hackers. According to Microsoft's security bulletin released today, any hacker who tricked victims into running a \"specially-crafted application\" could successfully exploit the system bug and gain the ability to \"install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\" Once exploited, the bug could be used to escape the sandbox protection and execute malicious code on the compromised Windows machine. Rated as \"important,\" the vulnerability was being exploited by Strontium group, also known as Fancy Bear, Sofacy, and APT 28, in targeted attacks. Fancy Bear is the same group of hackers that has also been accused by the US Intelligence community of hacking the Democratic National Committee , Clinton Campaign Chair John Podesta , and former Secretary of State Colin Powell, among others. Besides this controversial flaw exposed by Google last week, the security bulletin also fixes multiple elevation of privilege bugs. Patch Tuesday also contains several critical security patches that affect all versions of Windows as well as other important updates and fixes for both Internet Explorer and Edge. So, I strongly recommend home users and companies to ensure that their Windows PC is up-to-date with all of Microsoft's latest security fixes as of today.",

      "text": "Google enacts stricter penalties on sites that continuously spread malware Posted Twitter traffic doubled, Facebook up by 30% on Election Night \nGoogle has been protecting users against dangerous and harmful websites for many years by warning web surfers when they accidentally click on links that could lead them to sites that spread malware or attempt to phish for your private information. But many sites figured out how to work around Google’s policies. Instead of cleaning up their act, they would instead temporarily make adjustments so their site would appear to be compliant when Google verified it, then return to harming users once Google’s warnings were removed. Now, Google says it’s putting a stop to this behavior by classifying these sites as “repeat offenders” and enforcing stricter penalties. \nIn the past, when a site was in violation of Google’s Malware , Unwanted Software , Phishing, and Social Engineering Policies , it would display a warning to web searchers until Google could verify that the site was no longer harmful. This verification could be triggered automatically, or it could be made at the request of the site’s webmaster, Google explains in an announcement. \nBut that will now change. Starting today, sites that switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior will be labeled as “repeat offenders,” and will not be able to request re-verification for 30 days. That means for an entire month after being flagged and labeled, these sites will continue to show warnings to web searchers. \nThese warnings indicate that web users should avoid the site in question, and redirect you back to Google’s search results. That leads to dramatically decreased traffic for the sites in question. \nOnly after the month is up, will the webmaster be able to request a review of their flagged site. \nThe idea here is to close a gap in protection that existed with the prior policy. It will no longer be lucrative for these sites to only pretend to go complaint, as they’ll instead be continuously flagged for extended periods of time. \nGoogle says the policy won’t apply to those sites that are hacked, only those that spread malware and other harmful content intentionally. 0",

Thanks to the nearing ubiquity of USB-C on flagship devices, the feature is quickly becoming a standard – “standard” in the sense that everyone is doing it, not so much that there’s any consistency to the tech. All in all, it’s a nice addition to manufacturers’ newfound focus on battery life. \nAnd while Google has embraced its own version on its new Pixel devices, the company’s not so keen on letting everyone implement their own version. In newly released Android Compatibility Definition papers issued for Nougat, the company stops short of an outright ban on technologies like Qualcomm’s Quick Charge, though it does take a pretty clear stand, “strongly recommend[ing]” against it. \nAt issue, among other things here, is potential compatibility issues with standard USB chargers. Google wants everyone to play nicely together – that’s part of the appeal behind USB-C standardization in the first place. In fact, the document goes so far as explaining that it might make it a requirement in some future update. \nIt minces words a bit less here, \nWhile this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers. \nIt’s essentially the technical paper version of “don’t make me put my foot down.”",

As people celebrate Trump's victory in the United States (and many come to terms with it), the search trend on Google illustrates what's going on in many's minds. Searches for \"how to impeach a president\", for instance, have gone up 4,850 percent . Similarly, searches for \"how to move to Canada\", \"are people moving to Canada\", \"list of people moving to Canada\", \"immigrate to Canada\", \"list of people moving to Canada if Trump wins\" and \"where to move if Trump wins\" were also very popular, toot . Amid all of this, searches for \"nuclear shelter\" have skyrocketed as well.",

      "text": "Google's mini radar can identify virtually any object Project Soli just needs to get close to an item to determine what it is. Share Save \nGoogle's Project Soli radar technology is useful for much more than controlling your smartwatch with gestures . University of St. Andrews scientists have used the Soli developer kit to create RadarCat , a device that identifies many kinds of objects just by getting close enough. Thanks to machine learning , it can not only identify different materials, such as air or steel, but specific items. It'll know if it's touching an apple or an orange, an empty glass versus one full of water, or individual body parts. \nIt doesn't take much to realize that the potential for computing breakthroughs is significant. Your phone could perform different actions depending on how and where you hold it. You might get a different interface if you're wearing gloves, for instance. A restaurant would know to provide a refill the moment your drink is empty, and the blind could identify products in a store. It could be particularly useful for automatic sorting in farms and waste facilities, as well. The biggest obstacle is translating RadarCat from a clever concept to a practical product -- that could take a while. ",

      "title": "Where Are the Jobs for Autonomous Vehicle Engineers? GM and Google Top the List",
      "text": "Hardware and software engineers looking to work on autonomous vehicle technologies have lots of choices, according to an analysis by Indeed.com Illustration: Getty Images It’s a good time to be an engineer with some expertise in autonomous vehicles, particular a software engineer.\nThat’s what Daniel Culbertson thinks. He’s an economist for Indeed.com , the web-based job search engine.\n“This industry is on a steep line of growth right now, and I expect it to keep growing,” Culbertson said.\nCulbertson recently took a look at all of Indeed’s job listings for autonomous vehicle engineers over the past year. Most of the tech jobs in the industry were for software engineers, he told me, and the most jobs were in Germany. Interestingly, he said, there is less interest from German job seekers in those German jobs than from U.S. job seekers in U.S. jobs, generally, he said, because the U.S. is leading in autonomous vehicle innovation, and engineers want to be where the most interesting technology is.\nAll signs point to continued growth in job postings, Culbertson said. “Looking at the list of top employers,” he said, “it is good for the industry that you have both new tech companies like Google and Uber as well as the older automotive companies. That shows that we’re not seeing a flash in the pan. You also see automotive suppliers, not just car manufacturers, hiring; that ancillary companies are starting to invest also speaks to the continuing growth of this industry.”\nThe top 15 companies, in terms of share of job postings for autonomous vehicle engineers from October 2015 to October 2016, were:\nGM: 11.30 percent Google: 9.4 percent Ford: 6.4 percent Bosch: 6.4 percent Atieva ( now Lucid Motors ): 5.5 percent Workbridge Associates: 2.7 percent Daimler AG: 2.4 percent BMW: 2.1 percent Valeo: 2.1 percent HERE: 1.8 percent Nvidia: 1.8 percent Elektronische Fahrewerksystem GmbH: 1.8 percent Delphi Automotive: 1.6 percent Continental: 1.5 percent BMW-Mini: 1.3 percent Looking at worldwide trends, Culbertson considered just postings during the second quarter of this year. He did note that one posting does not necessarily always equate to one opening and can sometimes represent multiple openings, but said looking at postings can suggest general trends. The number of clicks, he indicated, shows the level of interest job seekers have in the industry.\nZeroing in on the U.S., Culbertson discovered that a spike in both job availability and interest in those jobs started about a year ago.\nA quick check of Indeed.com’s listing shows that the slope, if anything has gotten steeper since Culbertson ran these numbers. Right now, the jobs site lists at least 76 openings at Silicon Valley companies alone.\n",

Still, this is a major addition to Google’s payment system as it tries to compete with rivals like Apple Pay and Samsung Pay.\nWithout further ado, here’s the new list of 30 US banks that support Android Pay (since Capital One was added last week, it’s not on this list):\nBank Independent Bank of Rantoul Bank of the Pacific Citizens Savings Bank Colony Bank Community Bank Denver Fire Department FCU Elmira Savings Bank Federal Savings Bank First Security Bank and Trust Five Points Bank Generations Community FCU Great River FCU HAPO Community Credit Union Impact Bank Kitsap Bank Kleberg Bank Midcoast FCU Monona State Bank Novation Credit Union Palmetto Health Credit Union Pinnacle Bank Popular Community Bank Red Rocks Credit Union San Antonio Federal Credit Union Seaside National Bank & Trust Shell FCU TheBANK of Edwardsville TIAA-CREF Trust Company, FSB Vons Employees Federal Credit Union Has your bank been added to the updated Android Pay list in the US?\nGet it from Google Play ",

      "text": "Google has unveiled a potentially lifesaving function which will allow users to “unsend” controversial or embarrassing emails.\nWe’ve all sent ill-advised messages to bosses, friends, relatives or ex-lovers and then instantly wish we hadn’t.\nNow Google has stepped in with a safety net to “prevent embarrassing email mistakes.”\nIt has just announced an update to the iOS version of its Gmail app , which runs on Apple iPads and iPhones.\nProduct manager Matthew Izatt said the changes represent “the biggest overhaul of the app in nearly four years.”\nHe added: “It’s the Gmail you know and love, with a fresh new look, sleeker transitions and some highly-requested features. It’s a lot faster, too.”\n\n“With the new app, getting things done on the go is a lot easier — whether you’re trying to find a message your colleague sent you last month or trying to get through your work inbox on a Monday morning.”\nThe update also features a better search function and various interface improvements, as well as changes to the Calendar app.\nUsers of the desktop app can already unsend emails, but this is the first time the function is available on smartphones.\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun .\nFiled under apps ,  emails ,  google",

      "text": "November 9 at 10:48 AM Follow @caitlindewey\n(Google/The Washington Post) If we’ve learned anything in the past 12 hours, it’s this: Polls can be off; pundits can be wrong; predictions can be mistaken. Google searches, on the other hand, remain an excellent barometer of our collective id.\nThat was the certainly the case in the early evening on Tuesday when, according to Google Trends — a tool that identifies news topics spiking in search — Americans began searching by the tens of thousands for political news sources and basic information like “when do polls close on Election Day.”\n[ A traumatic campaign produces a shocking end ]\nIt was the case between 8 p.m. and midnight, when election results began to come in, and Americans overwhelmingly searched for counts from Pennsylvania and Florida, specifically, as well as general “poll trackers” and the ever popular “who’s winning the election.”\nBut you see a shift begin when the answer comes back, definitively, as Donald Trump. There’s suddenly a lot of concern about the stock market and Russian President Vladimir Putin. And there are a lot of questions, as there always are, about Canadian immigration. This, in short, is the story of blue America’s post-election grief, as told through Google searches.\n12 a.m. Presidential election results\nProjected election results\nLatest polls\nCNN\n1 a.m. California\nCalifornia electoral votes\nHillary Clinton for US President\n2 a.m. Pennsylvania\nElectoral votes\nWhat is an electoral vote\nHow does the electoral college work\nPopular vote\nNate Silver\nDow futures\nWho’s winning Trump or Hillary\n3 a.m. Michigan\nHow many electoral votes are there\nWho is ahead in the polls right now\nPopular vote\nCanadian immigration\nHow to move to Canada\nCanadian citizenship\n4 a.m. Elections\nWho is in the lead for President\n5 a.m. Who is our new president\nS&P 500\nConceded\nInauguration Day\nHarambe\n6 a.m. David Duke\nDemocracy\nMake America Great Again hat\n7 a.m. Riots\nMaine election results\nStock market crash\n8 a.m. Clinton concession speech\nTrump acceptance speech\nMove to Canada\nPutin\n9 a.m. Donald Trump memes\nHillary Clinton concession speech\nRiots\nRussia\nLiked that?

      "text": "Google will retire Map Maker, the tool that let anyone update Maps Most of its features will be rolled into Maps by March 2017. Share Save \nGoogle's Map Maker tool was released in April 2011 as a parallel version of its official Maps app that encouraged user-submitted geographical and business changes, essentially crowdsourcing updates. Ideally, moderators would check the edits and roll them into the official versions once confirmed, though some trolling vandalism has squeaked through in the past. But it seems the dream to trust everyone with public maps is dead. Yesterday, the search giant announced that they will retire Map Maker and fold it wholly into Maps by March 2017. \nStarting today, edits made in Map Maker won't be up for moderation, Google stated in a blog post . Instead, they'll be fully moved into Maps, . This begins a slow process for the search giant to transfer most, but probably not all of, the tools from Map Maker over to Maps leading up to and after its transition date next spring. What aspects won't make the jump are unclear, but restricting edits and suggestions to its Local Guides program might prevent another vulgar joke edit from shutting down the public-facing site for a few weeks.",

Google unveiled the redesign in June and only made it available companies that were accepted for an early adopter program. \nThe new version of Google Sites is enabled by default, but end users will only be able to use it if Google Drive and the previous version of Google Sites are both already enabled. In Google’s release terminology, the change is launching now in the rapid release track, and it will become available for end users in the scheduled release track on November 21. On the admin side, it’s launching now. For G Suite Government customers the new Google Sites won’t be available, at least not at this time.\nFor now, the older version of Google Sites will remain available as Google adds all of its capabilities to the new version. In 2017, Google will “provide and recommend options to migrate your sites from the classic Sites to the new Sites,” Google said in a blog post . “Beginning in 2018, we’ll send a timeline and instructions regarding the gradual process to shut down the classic Sites.”\nGoogle hasn’t yet chosen the date at which it will kill the previous version of Google Sites. But Google says that it will tell customers at least a year in advance.\nIf your company is already invested in the Google cloud services world — instead of or in addition to, for one, Microsoft productivity suite — this tool will be fairly easy to integrate with, and because this new version is collaborative like Google Docs, it’s certainly interesting. All files associated with new Google Sites pages are stored in Google Drive.\nMore information on the new Google Sites is here .\nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

      "text": "\nA minor problem for the Google Phone.\nGoogle's new Pixel phone has been pretty free of controversy since its release last month. No show-stopping software bugs; no severe hardware issues.\nGoogle has acknowledged the problem, but isn't saying specifically what is the outright cause.\nBut like any phone release, there have been a few waves of protest by people saying their device isn't working well in a particular situation. One such situation is on several South American and Canadian carriers that rely on Band 4, also known as AWS, to transit signal over the air. According to a number of Pixel and Pixel XL owners, their phones have trouble staying connected to the network on that band, but the problem is not consistent nor does it appear to be widespread.\nMany of the complainants live in South America , and subscribe to carriers like Claro that rely primarily on Band 4. Other people, such as Telus and Bell customers in Canada , have the same problem, but Band 4 is one of four possible frequency combinations used in many larger cities.\nGoogle has acknowledged the connectivity instability, but isn't saying specifically what is the outright cause — and Google may not know, because it may go deeper down the rabbit hole, into the X12 baseband drivers supplied by Qualcomm.\nThe bigger problem is that with connectivity issues, it is often a caused by a combination of factors — signal strength, interference, handoff instructions, carrier aggregation protocols — that can't be traced to just one source. In other words, people are saying \"the problem is with Band 4,\" but it's more likely that the problem is with merely most pronounced on that frequency. In the U.S., T-Mobile, AT&T and Verizon operate parts of their network on Band 4, and we haven't heard of any Americans with this problem.\nThroughout our testing the Pixel's signal came through strong and consistent, and we could not reproduce the issue.\nHere at Android Central, we tried to simulate the issue on a number of devices, including those on T-Mobile in the U.S. and Bell in Canada. Throughout our testing, the Pixel's signal came through strong and consistent, and we could not reproduce the issue.\nIf you're experiencing LTE problems on the Pixel, let us know, but also know this: it is almost definitely a software problem and will almost certainly be fixed in a coming update.\nGoogle Pixel + Pixel XL Google Pixel and Pixel XL review Google Pixel XL review: A U.S. perspective Google Pixel FAQ: Should you upgrade?

      "text": "Google punishes web backsliders in Chrome Browser will warn users of bad sites for at least 30 days More like this Google Chrome browser logos Credit: Gerd Altmann / Pixabay Email a friend Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 9, 2016 1:43 PM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGoogle said it will deal with website recidivists that have dodged the company's punishments for spreading malware and spawning email scams. \nWhen Google flags sites for hosting malicious code or unwanted software, or running some kind of scam, users see warnings in Chrome and other browsers. The alerts appear as long as Google believes the site poses a threat. \nBut after making changes to align their sites with Google's \"Safe Browsing\" terms, webmasters may ask Google to lift the virtual embargo. \nNot surprising, some took advantage of the mechanism for lifting the warnings. Sites would cease their illicit practices, but only long enough to get back into Google's good graces. Once Google gave the all-clear, the once-dirty-then-clean site would have a serious relapse and again distribute malware or spew phishing emails. \nTo close the loophole, Google added a new \"Repeat Offender\" website violation to its Safe Browsing rules. \n\"Repeat Offenders are websites that repeatedly switch between compliant and policy-violating behavior for the purpose of having a successful review and having warnings removed,\" said Brooke Heinichen, a Safe Browsing strategist, in a post to a company blog Tuesday. \nThat end-around was as if a restaurant scrubbed its kitchen at the order of a city health department, but as soon as the inspector left, had employees upend garbage pails. \nThe main impact on sites marked as repeaters: Webmasters may not request a re-check until 30 days have elapsed. The time-out was intended to discourage sites from repeating the dirty-clean again and again and again. \nThus, once a site is labeled a repeat offender, in-Chrome warnings will continue to appear for a minimum of 30 days. \nChrome last month was the most popular browser on personal computers by a wide margin. According to analytics vendor Net Applications, 55% of all browser users ran Chrome in October. That was nearly twice the next-most-popular browser's share; Microsoft's Internet Explorer (and successor, Edge) accounted for 28% of all browsers. RELATED TOPICS ",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Maria Sacchetti Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nMilton Lopez opened his Everett market at 8 a.m., like always, stacking the quesadillas, the fresh rolls and the tamales for customers. But by mid-morning he was all alone, watching television with tears in his eyes.\nDonald J. Trump, the Republican who would deport his relatives, his customers, and his friends, had narrowly defeated Hillary Clinton. And in some states, as the television showed, Latinos had helped him win.\nAdvertisement\n“What’s done is done. There’s no going back,” said Lopez, a father of two from El Salvador who has a green card, but is worried about those who don’t. “I couldn’t believe it. I thought it was going to be her, but then he kept winning and winning and winning.”\nAs politicians called for reconciliation Wednesday, immigrants, Muslims and others in Trump’s crosshairs remained frozen in fear. Trump has vowed to deport millions of unauthorized immigrants, strip temporary work permits from thousands of others, and bar Muslims from coming to America .\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here This is in addition to building an “impenetrable” wall on the southern border, and forcing Mexico to pay for it, ending sanctuary cities such as Cambridge and Chelsea, and tripling the number of immigration agents available to deport people.\nThe election results blared from television screens in laundromats, restaurants and bakeries on Wednesday, unsettling workers and worrying parents. Several said their children asked if they would be forced to leave the country.\nAdvocates for immigrants said they tried to reassure immigrants that they would try to keep them safe, though there were no guarantees.\nAdvertisement\nIn Chelsea, a majority Hispanic city where 44 percent of the 39,300 residents are immigrants, advocates for immigrants looked shaken. Some were still trembling the day after the election.\n“You can imagine in a community like Chelsea what this means,” said Gladys Vega, executive director of the Chelsea Collaborative, a nonprofit that aids immigrants. “This morning I’ve been in bakeries and bodegas crying with people. People are hopeless. People are in a panic.”\nWednesday night, Vega and coworker Yessenia Alfaro, also a city school committee member, were planning to travel to Washington for an already-scheduled summit on immigration. Advocates nationwide had hoped to meet to plan a new blueprint for immigration reform under Clinton.\nInstead, they said, they would have to craft a battle plan for how to deal with Trump.\nAt stake are at least 11 million immigrants in the United States illegally — not counting hundreds of thousands of others with temporary work permits from El Salvador, Brazil, Honduras and Haiti.\nSome received work permits through President Obama’s deferred action program for immigrants here illegally since they were children. Others received them because of disasters or wars in their homelands, such as those from Haiti or Syria.\nIn Massachusetts, some 210,000 immigrants were here illegally as of 2014, about 19 percent of the 1 million immigrants in the state, according to a September report from the Pew Research Center.\nMassachusetts is one of six states where the undocumented population rose from 2009 to 2014, an uptick of about 35,000 people.\nMaria Sacchetti can be reached at maria.sacchetti@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\n November 09, 2016\nDONALD TRUMP, who rolled to an astonishing victory in the presidential election, laid waste to conventional wisdom, the polling industry, his opponents, the truth, and almost every remaining rule of decency left in American politics. Regrettably, it worked. In the wee hours of the morning Wednesday, he claimed the narrowest of Electoral College victories over Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\nNow all must live with the consequences. The president-elect will immediately face challenges containing the forces that he has unleashed. If, as he vowed, Trump wants to make America great again, his first and most urgent task is to make it civil again.\nAdvertisement\nTrump’s candidacy relied on ethnic scapegoating and fear-mongering to rally blue-collar white voters, who bridled at immigration, foreign trade, and a sense that their country was slipping away from them. Claiming to speak for the everyman, he offered vague, impractical, or impossible promises like forcing Mexico to pay for a border wall in order to stop illegal immigration.\nThat demogoguery may have won him an election, but for millions of Americans, his tactics reeked of racism and bigotry. The surge in turnout by Hispanic voters, while not enough to stop Trump, was vivid evidence of the impact his rhetoric has had on American society\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Yet the nation cannot survive if it remains so polarized, and it falls to the president, above all others, to recognize that challenge. To put it charitably, Trump did nothing during the campaign to suggest he has the skills to heal a divided nation. As our president-elect, he will have to demonstrate a grace that has remained elusive, and make clear that he understands his job from this day on is to overcome divisions, not exacerbate them.\nView Story Full election results Check out the national and state results Tuesday night.\nHe will also need to do what he never did during the campaign: put together a coherent plan for his government, starting with a Cabinet. He was rightly shunned by most Republicans during the campaign, but now he will need their help to give substance to his vague promises to make everything great.\nFor the Democrats, who virtually cleared their primary field for Clinton despite her known vulnerabilities, Wednesday must prompt a reckoning. The party appears to be headed into the wilderness, having failed to gain control of either the House or the Senate. In the same way Republicans undertook an autopsy after the 2012 presidential election, Democrats must take a hard look at how they lost former mainstays like Wisconsin.\nAdvertisement\nThis outcome is not one that this page welcomes. Trump looks like a disaster in the making; all Americans can do now is pray that he proves his skeptics wrong.\nloading\nElectoral votes 228 Clinton\n31 Undecided\n279 Trump\n59,740,463 votes\n270 to win\n59,521,401 votes\n99.04% reporting\nData source: AP\nThe 2016 election Full election results Mass. ballot questions Town-by-town results Series: America on Edge",

      "text": " Google+\nTimothy A. Clark/AFP/Getty Images\nDonald Trump and Hillary Clinton on stage during the second debate.\nBy Newton N. Minow November 09, 2016\nA s a vice chairman of the Commission on Presidential Debates, I stay out of partisan activity during presidential election years. Like most Americans, I am thankful that the 2016 election is over. This was the most foul campaign period in my lifetime, and that’s a long time, because I am 90.\nI have been privileged to have had a role in organizing every televised presidential debate, starting with the broadcasting networks in 1960, and then with the League of Women Voters in 1976, 1980, and 1984, and with the Commission on Presidential Debates in 1988, 1992, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2008, 2012, and 2016. I’ve had a front-row seat as the debates have evolved.\nAdvertisement\nThe 2016 debates were the most unpleasant. Yet they may have been the most important. An estimated 200 million people watched the major candidates, warts and all. The debates provided the unique opportunity to evaluate candidates through our exceptional communication technologies. Live television, cable, satellites, radio, the Internet, cell phones, social media — all were easily available. In the United States, with 320 million people stretched over thousands of miles, voters can participate in democracy in a complicated world of globalization and technological revolution. I am proud of having had a small hand in this process for decades. I will retire from the commission next year. I believe the best is yet to be.\nWe might avoid some of our current, harmful polarization if we use communication technologies to stimulate more debate to address our problems. Serious problems of redistricting, campaign finance, and health care are already on the agenda. So today, I raise two other structural problems which also need national discussion, analysis, and debate so we can have better elections in the future. The first is our nominating process. The second is restructuring our political parties. These problems are interrelated. In 2016, a large majority of voters were dissatisfied with the choice of candidates presented to them. What our country needs now is serious debate about the way we nominate candidates and the way our political parties offer choice to the voters. Leaders of broadcasting, cable, , and social media should, in 2017, offer debates to help American voters understand these problems.\nGet Todays Headlines in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here The nominating process, now dominated by state primary elections and caucuses, extends over a period of about six months. Proponents of primaries contend that primaries take the nomination away from party bosses in the back room and give the decisions to the voters. But, as I have argued for years, they haven’t worked out that way. Instead, the current version of primaries turns the decisions over to a new kind of boss. Today a small, unrepresentative handful of activists, often concerned with only one issue, or with narrow special interests, dominates the primaries. Because the broad center of moderate and independent voters seldom vote in party primaries, decisions are abdicated to tiny groups of motivated extremists of the left or the right. Current pressures push the Democrats to the left and the Republicans to the right. And the new sort of boss system may be worse than the old.\nAs a result, this year a majority of American voters report that they did not want Clinton nor Trump. Analysts reported that a total of only 9 percent of America’s eligible voters voted for Clinton or Trump in the primaries. So, less than 10 percent of American voters chose our candidates. Take the experience of Eric Cantor, a Republican congressman from Virginia who was majority leader of the House. He was opposed in a Republican primary in his district and defeated by an extremist campaign. As a result, today moderate Republican and moderate Democratic senators and members of Congress fear that they will be “primaried” by extremists of the left or the right if they work toward compromise on issues. Like many well-intended reforms, primaries made the nominating process worse, not better.\nBetter alternatives? Go back to the old smoke-filled room? Abraham Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt were chosen that way. Nonpartisan open primaries in which the top two vote-getters proceed to the general election, regardless of their party affiliations, as in California? Mandatory voting in primaries, so you cannot vote in the general election if you have not voted in the primary? Other alternatives? National debate and discussion is badly needed. I am not smart enough to know the solution, but I do know that the present system is a dangerous failure.\nAdvertisement\nSecond issue: restructuring and realigning the parties. In 1944, I was an 18-year-old US Army sergeant in the China-Burma-India theater of World War II when I read that President Franklin Roosevelt had invited Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Republican candidate for president, to the White House for a talk. Roosevelt told Willkie that the two of them agreed more about international policy than many Republicans agreed with Willkie or many Democrats agreed with Roosevelt. Roosevelt asked Willkie to examine ways to join moderate Republican internationalists with moderate Democratic internationalists into one party and isolationist Republicans and Democrats into another party. Willkie said he agreed but was about to leave on a trip around the world and that he would work with Roosevelt on this project as soon as he returned. He left on the trip, got sick, and died.\nBut the idea of realigning the parties did not die. What if moderate Democrats and moderate Republicans today joined to form a party or coalition of the center? Ted Cruz and Donald Trump could join forces to create a party on the right, Bernie Sanders and Jill Stein could join forces to have a party on the left. Voters could have three policy choices. It would be in the public interest to have a broad national debateto see if the Roosevelt/Willkie discussion is relevant for the 21st century. Perhaps a quiet, off-the-record dinner in 2017 with Hillary Clinton and Mitt Romney, two moderates, could revive the Roosevelt/Willkie conversation and explore whether this approach makes sense.\nReaders will react that I am dreaming. True, but I am not old enough to stop dreaming or to lose optimism. The United States of America was founded on a dream. Communication technologies, which brought the presidential debates to all of us, can also stimulate new ideas in 2017 to replace our current bitter partisanship and dysfunctional government. As a Chicagoan proud of our Chicago Cubs who, after a bad century, returned this year to a national championship, I say: Keep the faith.\nNewton N. Minow, senior counsel of Sidley Austin, was chairman of the Federal Communications Commission under President John F. Kennedy.",

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Blanding/Globe staff\nSupporters of Question 4 celebrated as returns came in Tuesday.\nBy Joshua Miller Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nMassachusetts politicians and public officials were scrambling Wednesday after voters legalized marijuana for recreational use.\nGovernor Charlie Baker, House Speaker Robert A. DeLeo, and Senate President Stanley C. Rosenberg all said they would accept the will of the voters and work to implement the new law, which will make pot legal for adult use on Dec. 15, and allow retail marijuana shops to open in 2018.\nAdvertisement\nThe initiative poses an immediate challenge for state government, which will need to quickly craft new laws and regulations to oversee what could soon be a billion-dollar business. Those could mandate everything from how high is too high to be on the road, to what form edibles — the marijuana-infused treats like brownies — can take.\nBaker campaigned against Question 4, arguing, in concert with most top state officials, that it would be bad for Massachusetts. But speaking to reporters in Boston, the Republican governor said he will respect the voice of residents, while addressing some of thorny issues legalization creates.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here “Our view on this is: The people spoke, and we’re going to honor that,” Baker said at an unrelated transportation event. “But we need to make sure that we implement this in a way that is consistent with a lot of the rhetoric and the dialogue that took place during the course of the campaign — that it would be done in a way that does protect public safety and ensure that only those who are supposed to have access to these products will.”\nView Story Marijuana on the Globe’s front page Take a look back at previous times pot has landed on Page One.\nWhat you need to know\nThe new law legalizes the drug only for those who are at least 21 years old.\nAmong the most high-profile supporters of the measure was Rosenberg. The Amherst Democrat told the Globe in an interview Wednesday that the Legislature would consider making some changes to the law.\nAdvertisement\n“I believe that when voters vote on most ballot questions, they are voting in principle, they are not voting on the fine detail that is contained within the proposal,” he said, noting that the timetable was “very aggressive” and could be ripe for change.\nRosenberg said any adjustments to the law should come after the people who may be affected have their say.\n“The voices of stakeholders must be heard in this process,” he said. “When you craft a ballot question, it’s usually crafted by a group of like-minded people. I’m not going to say they ignore other interests ... but their emphasis and their direction is usually consistent with their own views about what ought to be done.”\nSo, Rosenberg said, it’s important to bring other voices to the table.\nAfter legalization passed in Colorado in 2012, Governor John Hickenlooper, who had opposed the measure, created a wide-ranging task force. Its aim was to identify the legal, policy and procedural issues that needed to be resolved, and to offer proposals for legislative, regulatory and executive actions that should be taken.\nThe group included legislators, lawyers, police, district attorneys, doctors, marijuana industry representatives, concerned citizen groups, public health officials, and local officials.\nAnd its recommendations were largely put into place by the Legislature and Hickenlooper.\nMassachusetts could well follow a similar path.\nBeacon Hill politicians have broad latitude to change the law voters just approved — and they don’t always respect the will of the voters when it comes to referenda.\nIn 2000, voters passed a ballot initiative incrementally knocking the rate down from 5.85 percent to 5 percent. The first ticks downward took place at the beginning of 2001 and 2002. But then the Legislature, facing tough economic times, froze the final tax cut.\nInstead, legislators set a series of economic growth thresholds which would — much, much more slowly than voters intended — lower the tax rate to 5 percent, but only if the state economy was humming along.\nMore than 16 years later, the tax rate still isn’t there.\nAnd implementation of complicated voter initiatives doesn’t always go smoothly. The state’s rollout of the voter-approved medical marijuana law was disastrous, rife with charges of conflicts of interest, political favoritism, and questionable vetting of marijuana companies. Even though voters approved marijuana for medical use in November 2012, the first dispensary did not open until the summer of 2015.\nBaker said he was keen to avoid a repeat of that fiasco, which took place under his predecessor, Deval Patrick.\n“I don’t want to go through, for example, sort of the disconnects and the false starts that were associated with the state’s implementation of the medical marijuana law,” the governor said Wednesday, adding he wanted the laws implementation to be “responsible and timely.”\nOn Wednesday morning, meanwhile, the Archdiocese of Boston, which had made a high-profile last minute push against marijuana legalization, issued a statement expressing regret.\n“We are very disappointed that Question Four was approved, allowing for the commercialization of marijuana in Massachusetts,” it said. “It was and continues to be encouraging that our parishes and many of our colleagues in the ecumenical and interfaith community gave significant time and support for the effort to defeat this harmful legislation. Anticipating significantly increased demands on many of the Archdiocese’s social service and assistance programs, due to the documented effects of widespread marijuana use, we will continue to as best possible provide for the needs of the people we serve.” Kay Lazar of the Globe staff contributed to this report.

      "text": " Google+\nDavid L. Ryan/Globe Staff\nElizabeth Warren left the voting booth after casting her ballot in Cambridge Tuesday.\nBy Andy Rosen and Annie Linskey Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nUS Senator Elizabeth Warren on Wednesday said she was disappointed that Donald Trump won the presidential election despite apparently losing the overall vote, but pledged to respect the outcome.\n“It’s no secret that I didn’t want to see Donald Trump win yesterday,” the Massachusetts Democrat said in a statement to the Boston Globe, noting that returns show Hillary Clinton coming up short in the Electoral College even though she appears poised to tally more votes overall.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m intensely frustrated by the apparent likelihood that, for the second time in five elections, a Democratic nominee will have won the popular vote but lost the presidency in the electoral college,” Warren said.\nIn the 2000 presidential race, George W. Bush lost the popular vote to Al Gore, but won the presidency after a protracted legal battle over the Florida vote.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Warren added that “the integrity of our democracy is more important than any individual election, and those of use who supported Hilary Clinton will respect this result.”\n“President-Elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task,” she said. “When he takes the oath of office as the leader of our democracy and the leader of all Americans, it is my sincere hope that he will fulfill that role with respect and concern for every single person in the country, no matter who they are, where they come from, what they believe, or whom they love.”\nWarren is a prominent figure in the Democratic party and was considered a potential running mate for Hillary. She clashed sharply with Trump during the campaign, exchanging barbs with him on Twitter and excoriating him in speeches.\nAdvertisement\nMassachusetts Democratic US Representative Michael Capuano said in a statement that “difficult days” lay ahead, but he would “try as hard as I can” to work with the president and Republican majorities in the House and Senate.\nStatement to The Globe from @SenWarren on the 2016 election results. pic.twitter.com/thrapUfdkS\n— Annie Linskey (@AnnieLinskey) November 9, 2016\nAndy Rosen can be reached at andrew.rosen@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBy Laura Crimaldi and John R. Ellement Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nKen Yuszkus/pool\nSalem police officer Brian Butler (left) was charged with one count each of rape and indecent assault and battery.\nSALEM — Salem’s police chief, whose husband was arraigned Wednesday on accusations that he raped a man in the police station on Halloween, said the rest of her department shouldn’t be judged by the alleged actions of one officer.\nChief Mary Butler spoke to reporters after Officer Brian Butler, 56, was arraigned in Salem District Court on charges of rape and indecent assault and battery.\nAdvertisement\n“The alleged actions of one person shouldn’t reflect badly upon the department and the officers that are working very diligently every day to do their job,\" said Chief Butler, who is taking time off because of her husband’s arrest.\nBail was at $10,000 for Officer Butler after a prosecutor described how the alleged attacks occurred in the booking area and in a broom closet at police headquarters.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here In a statement, Salem Mayor Kimberley Driscoll said the city plans to take steps to fire the officer and offered support for the police chief.\n“I fully expect that she is capable of leading the department with the same high level of integrity and commitment she has demonstrated since her appointment and throughout her career,” Driscoll said.\nIn a police report filed in court, authorities wrote that Salem police went to the Clipper Ship Inn on Bridge Street at about 3:07 a.m. on Oct. 31, where they found an intoxicated man wearing “soaking wet” clothing because he had flooded his motel room.\nAdvertisement\nThe man was taken into protective custody and driven to the police station, where he removed his clothes and fell asleep in a holding cell. Between 6 a.m. and 9 a.m., the man was lying naked in his cell when Butler asked if he could do anything to help him. The man asked for a blanket, which Butler provided.\nHe also asked to use the telephone, and while standing outside the cell, Butler allegedly placed his hand around the man’s hip in a suggestive manner, asked whether he could touch the man’s genitals, and molested him, the report said.\n“He asked if it was, ‘OK’ and I said, ‘Yes’ out of fear,” the man wrote in a statement. He contacted police with his accusations Nov. 5.\nAfter the man finished using the phone, he said, Butler took him to a broom closet near the booking room and cells and asked to perform oral sex on him, according to the statement.\n“In fear, I said, ‘Yes,’ ” the man wrote in a statement.\nThe man told investigators Butler raped him in the closet,\nEssex Assistant District Attorney A.J. Camelio said in court.\nCamelio said video from the station “confirms nearly everything” in the man’s account.\nThe man told police he was still intoxicated when Butler approached him, Camelio said, and “was afraid to do anything to stop it because he was in custody.’’\nNot-guilty pleas were entered on Butler’s behalf. Defense lawyer, Randy Chapman, said the allegations raise questions about whether the man consented to the encounter.\n“The government would have to prove beyond a reasonable doubt in this case that there was a lack of consent,” Chapman said outside court. “The government has alleged that the complainant in this matter had agreed or essentially said yes, but he says that he felt compelled to do it.”\nSalem police placed Butler on administrative leave with pay the same day the man reported the accusations, the report said.\nWhile meeting with officers, Officer Butler apologized “for putting you guys through this” and said he “gave into temptation,” according to another police report.\n“I’ve embarrassed myself, my family, and the police department,” Officer Butler allegedly said in the report. “I’ve ruined a 24-year career.”\nHe also asked if the man accused him of rape, saying the encounter was consensual, the report said. Officer Butler surrendered his badge, gun, and Salem police identification card.\nChief Butler was not present at the meeting.\nLaura Crimaldi can be reached at laura.crimaldi@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Moore/Getty Images\nTwo women comforted each other as the reacted to the voting results on Election Night.\nBy Felice J. Freyer Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nPsychologist Jason Evan Mihalko started getting texts from his patients in the middle of the night as the election results came in — people scared and overwhelmed by the news of Donald J. Trump’s presidential victory.\nDawn Cisewski, an assistant teaching professor at Northeastern University, said some students were feeling so distressed they couldn’t come to class Wednesday.\nAdvertisement\nIn other parts of the country, celebrations may be under way, but for many in Massachusetts, the shock of the 2016 presidential election is nothing short of traumatic, according to several psychologists. Mihalko likened Trump’s election to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, in the way it changed the world and made many feel unsafe.\n“People of color, women, trauma survivors, LGBT people are having a physiological flight-or-fight response,” he said. “A lot of the rhetoric has been very negative. People in those groups are experiencing it as a threat.”\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Lisa Y. Livshin, a Newton psychologist and Tufts Medical School faculty member, said people’s responses to the election remind her of survivors she has treated at disasters. “It’s like a collective trauma for a lot of people,” she said. Some of her patients were having nightmares even before the election. Now, she advises them, “Just be really gentle with yourself right now.”\nHere are several coping tips offered by psychologists:\nTake a break. Turn off the television and social media. Don’t follow the news every minute. “It’s OK to kind of pack this up and put it on the shelf,” said Mihalko, who advises absorbing the information in small doses going forward.\nAdvertisement\nTake care of yourself. Accept your feelings of fear and anxiety but don’t let them consume your life. “Utilize those coping resources that have helped you through difficult times in the past,” advises Cisewski, president of the Massachusetts Psychological Association. That can mean going out for a walk, gathering with friends, doing yoga or deep breathing, or pursuing other calming activities.\n“When we’re in the fight-or-flight response, we can’t engage in critical thinking,” Mihalko said. “It’s hard to develop plans.”\nTake action. Find a way to make a difference. Join organizations, write letters, hold up signs, talk with friends, become engaged with a social movement, Mihalko advises. “When people feel most powerful and most centered is when they feel like they have a sense of agency,” he said.\nCisewski said it’s easy “to get stuck in the quagmire of what just happened. This is the reality. There’s nothing we can do to change it. What can I do now to be productive? . . . Being solution-focused and using this as an area for motivation is going to be important for a lot of people.”\nTry to understand what happened . Cisewski said that while people in Boston are weeping, her friends in the Midwest are celebrating. “It’s important to recognize that we have a divided country and how best to change that,” she said.\nEach side has scorned the other, whether it’s the right attacking immigrants and liberals , or the left ridiculing the denizens of “flyover country,” Mihalko said.\n“We all need to be gentle with each other and curious about each other’s experiences,” he said.\nFelice J.

      "text": " Google+\nBy Yvonne Abraham Globe Columnist November 09, 2016\nI’ve got nothing for you, friends.\nI lied to my son Wednesday morning. I told him it was OK that Donald Trump had won the election, that nothing would change, really.\nAdvertisement\nI’m not going to lie to you. You’re grown-ups, after all. And if you care about women, immigrants, African-Americans; if you care about the Constitution, freedom of the press, the Geneva Conventions; if you care about the menace posed by white supremacists, anti-Semites, and Vladimir Putin; if you care about America’s place in the world, family values, tax fairness; if you care about humanity, temperament, honesty; if you care whether the leader of the free world has a basic understanding of how government works; a willingness to learn anything, or actual, specific policies of any kind, what happened on Tuesday night is terrifying.\nMy son has known only Barack Obama as president. The fact that the president is black is utterly unremarkable to him. And it looked like that dignified, thoughtful, measured president would be succeeded by another groundbreaker, the wildly competent and astoundingly well-qualified Hillary Clinton. No big deal, my son would see: The president of the United States is a woman.\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox: Sign Up Thank you for signing up! Sign up for more newsletters here Most all of us thought this was going to happen going into Tuesday night, even many of those who supported Trump. I wept as I cast my ballot for Clinton, because I thought I was helping to usher in a new world, one that would show our daughters, and our sons, that the possibilities for women are limitless.\nBefore it began to fall away, I started a column on the milestone:\n“If you’re a woman, or someone who cares about them, this is a groundbreaking, historic, inspiring moment — no matter your party,” it was going to say. “Ninety-six years after our half of the population won the right to vote, Hillary Clinton’s victory speaks to the great progress we’ve made in this country.\nAdvertisement\n“But, in the case of this particular woman, and this crazy, ugly presidential race, it also speaks to how very far we’ve yet to go.\nIt turned out I was half-right.\nIn the days leading up to the election, early voters I talked to expressed similar sentiments, seeing in Clinton’s ascendancy an antidote to the slights and wrongs women had suffered, that they had suffered themselves.\n“Growing up, people were always telling me, ‘Oh, you have to smile, dear,’ ” said Cynthia Scott, 76, of Beacon Hill. “It was so patronizing. They’ll see [Hillary] can do the job. She’ll make a difference.”\nJane Owens, 63, thought there would be parties in her South End neighborhood when Clinton won. “The three major powers will have women leaders,” she said. “Three women against Putin, imagine that!”\n“Oh my God, at last,” said Arlene Freed, 70, of the North End. “I am so excited to see a woman in the White House. I thought I would never see it. If she loses, it’s because this country is so misogynistic.”\nShe lost. And we have to recognize that yes, some of the people who voted for Trump are misogynistic themselves, or fine with that dismal side of him. They either hold views themselves that are racist, anti-Semitic, and bigoted, or they’re fine with backing someone with those views, which amounts to the same thing. Some of these voters — mostly white — feel the nation left them behind, and some of them are angry. And they were willing to throw the rest of us under the bus to follow a man whose words and deeds give the lie to all of the promises he made to win their support.\nI started hearing from some of them as Trump’s stunning upset came clear on Tuesday night, sore winners taunting me, menacing me. Whatever else it may do, don’t kid yourself that Trump’s ascendancy will make the hate and anger go away.\nSo where do we go from here?\nHillary Clinton laid out a path in her generous concession speech on Wednesday morning.\n“And to all the women, and especially the young women, who put their faith in this campaign and in me: I want you to know that nothing has made me prouder than to be your champion,” she said. “And to all of the little girls who are watching this, never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance and opportunity in the world to pursue and achieve your own dreams.”\nIt was as graceful a speech as she has ever given, a glimpse into the calm and maturity we might have had in her as a president. She urged us to move beyond the hate, and toward a more perfect union. In doing so, she made her loss feel even more gut-wrenching, more total, and even more our own.\nGlobe columnist Yvonne Abraham can be reached at yvonne.abraham@globe.com.

      "text": "Google machine learning can protect endangered sea cows Researchers are using the AI-related tech to spot and track the animal's population. Save Reinhard Dirscherl/ullstein bild via Getty Images \nIt's one thing to track endangered animals on land, but it's another to follow them when they're in the water. How do you spot individual critters when all you have are large-scale aerial photos? Google might just help. Queensland University researchers have used Google's TensorFlow machine learning to create a detector that automatically spots sea cows in ocean images. Instead of making people spend ages coming through tens of thousands of photos, the team just has to feed photos through an image recognition system that knows to look for the cows' telltale body shapes. \nLike most current machine learning experiments, this isn't completely accurate. An initial version could spot 80 percent of the sea cows that had been confirmed in existing photos. If performance improves enough, however, it would be much easier for scientists to both measure the size of endangered sea mammal populations and track their movement patterns. That, in turn, could lead to more targeted conservation efforts that could save a given species from extinction.",

      "text": "› Google might try to block fast charging systems that don't comply to USB Type C standard Google might try to block fast charging systems that don't comply to USB Type C standard Posted: Tags : Android - Android + Google - Google + While fast charging on smartphones and tablets is a very welcome feature indeed, it has led to its own specific fragmentation due to the variety of fast charging standards employed, such as Qualcomm Quick Charge, Oppo VOOC, and Media PumpExpress, to name the more prominent ones. Many phones equipped with them require special standardized chargers in order to let users benefit from fast charging. But it's usually only the high-end models that bundle a fast charging-ready charger in the box, leaving some users to a confusing search for the correct third-party fast charger for their phone.Thus, Google wants to back a universal fast charging solution, presumably the same one it uses for the Pixel phones' USB Type-C standard chargers, and is doing so by encouraging (while subtly threatening an outright ban on third-party solutions) device makers to not adopt fast charging technologies that modify operating voltages beyond standard measure. The text is found inside the latest Android Compatibility Definition document for Android Nougat. In the future, Google could require all USB Type-C devices to support full compatibility with standard USB Type-C chargers, which may or may not render third-party solutions non-viable. Mind you, this doesn't mean that Android suddenly won't support any form of fast charging. Rather, Google wants to get rid of device-specific chargers and possibly prevent accidents such as exploding (overloaded) batteries. Although smartphone batteries very rarely explode, different fast charging solutions are known for pushing li-ion batteries to their limits, and are therefore not as safe as \"standard\" chargers.",

      "text": "GUEST: \nThe demand for virtual reality hardware and content currently outweighs supply, which is a good problem to have when you’re a marketer. But the supply challenges are only temporary. In fact, Google’s new Daydream VR device is set to go live tomorrow, paired with a framework that allows Daydream apps to work on some Android phones. Brands and advertisers should use the next short window of time as an opportunity to test creative, understand what works, and get ahead of the curve when it comes to creating content and experiences for a more mature market.\nAbove: Google Daydream\nImage Credit: vr.google.com/daydream Nearly one-fourth (24 percent) of US consumers aged 18-54 said they will likely use or purchase VR in the next year, according to a Nielsen study. Another 20 percent said they didn’t plan to try it but then expressed increased interest after learning about the basics. As we enter an era of VR, we still face a number of technological hurdles before we reach mass adoption, but perhaps we are closer than we think.\nWe’ve seen the industry gravitate towards a more interactive vs. passive experience for consumers with the success of 3D ad units on mobile devices and 360-degree video. The enormous success of Snapchat Lenses showed us that augmented reality is a precursor of sorts, helping prepare the market for a full-fledged VR experience. According to Snapchat, users spend an average of 20 seconds a day with the Lens feature. During the Super Bowl, Gatorade’s Lens had an incredible 165 million views.\nAbove: Gatorade’s Snapchat lens\nWith the market primed for more interactive and experiential marketing, virtual reality will offer benefits far beyond what traditional advertising can do. Brands can build upon these first forays into AR, 3D mobile, and display ad units to create virtual worlds for consumers that completely transform the ad experience. And with the emergence of lower cost options like Google cardboard, Samsung’s Gear VR, or the recently released Xiaomi Mi VR (for an incredible $29), it’s now more financially feasible for interested consumers to access content.\nImmersive rich media formats perform well beyond traditional measures in that they are 267 percent more effective and 8X more engaging than static banners, according into an eMarketer study. Interactive VR ad units based in 3D modeling allow for truly user-driven ad experiences, where users have ultimate control over what they see, hear, and interact with in the VR world, giving them even more reason to spend time inside these new and intriguing creative executions.\nFor brands, this means identifying characteristics of your product or service that can be made interactive and drive storylines from those features and benefits. Marketing has evolved into the art of storytelling, and VR is an opportunity for brands to build experiences around messaging.\nAbove: Xiaomi Mi VR\nImage Credit: www.mi.com The travel industry has been an early adopter of virtual reality for marketing, and has used immersive video to give jetsetters and vacationers an opportunity to give their beach getaways a test run before booking their tickets. Through the Vegas VR App, the Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority offers would-be travelers 360 videos and VR experiences to see the sites from their mobile device. And several cruise lines, including Princess and Carnival, let you see the rooms in VR before you commit to booking your tickets.\nAbove: Vegas VR app\nImage Credit: www.vrtv.vegas Virtual reality also lets advertisers tap into what CNN’s executive producer Jon Farkas has referred to as the “empathy machine,” citing the powerful emotional connection VR can bring. All brands should strive to create meaningful and emotional connections with consumers, as these authentic connections are what build brand loyalty. By engaging all of a consumer’s senses, you can transport them into an entirely different mindset in a way that bridges the divide between the physical and digital worlds.\nWe’re fast approaching the time in advertising where virtual reality is the norm. Brands looking to captivate audiences with highly personalized and experiential campaigns should capitalize on its increasing popularity before widespread adoption.\nPaul DeGrote is VP of Creative Services at Amobee . \nGet more stories like this on Twitter & Facebook ",

Percy Pig has been given Santa's hat this Christmas \nEver wandered into a work canteen and had no-one to sit with? Had no-one turn around and invite you to their table? It’s awful. \nLuckily, a kid in California, US, was saved from this feeling when he was the new boy, after his family moved over from Mexico. \nRafael didn’t know much English, so was struggling to make friends – but this didn’t go noticed by his kind-hearted classmate Amanda. \nWho decided to do something about it. \nNot put off by not knowing any Spanish, 10-year-old Amanda simply wrote a letter and put it through Google Translate. \nIt read: ‘Would you like to sit with me today? Look for me and I will show you where I sit. We can color or simply tell scary stories. Thank you for your time, signed Amanda.’ \nSpoiler alert: Amanda’s efforts worked and they’re now pals. \n‘Literally I’ve been crying ever since then because I thought it was the sweetest thing in the world,’ her mum, Kimber Kinard, told CBS News . \nIn a cute turn of events, it also transpires that Rafael is actually Amanda’s neighbour! So they did what any 10-year-old buddies would do and went trick-or-treating. \nWe’re not crying, you are. ",

A kid straddled a bike, going nowhere, wasting away a cloudy afternoon, in a Make America Great Again cap.\nThis is Pike County, in the northeastern corner of Pennsylvania, a state most had expected would deliver for Hillary Clinton, part of her vaunted Blue Wall that was supposed to reach 270 electoral votes, a wall that crumbled Tuesday under an unforeseen wave of Donald Trump voters.\nAdvertisement\nManny Perez, who worked in the financial industry and now is a consultant, lives in Dingmans Ferry, part of Pike County. He speaks with a very deep, clear voice between puffs of a cigarette in an interview on Broad Street, Milford’s quaint downtown drag. There are lawyers and realtors in business in Milford, antique shops, cafes and a few bars. Even some of the locals wonder where people who live in the city manage to work.\nThe genius of the Trump campaign was not always what Trump said, Perez suggested, but how.\nGet Fast Forward “Trump didn’t offer superior details, but the spirit of the message was there: That we’re not going to be forgotten. In the Trump White House the American worker, the American innovator will not be forgotten,” Perez said.\nView Story GOP to have full control in D.C. Republicans’ success in holding on to Congress hands the party the means to, as promised, dismantle President Obama’s legacy.\nFor many, Trump is a thing called hope More white women supported Trump\nTuesday’s presidential election revealed anew a polarized country divided between the deep blue Democratic cities of the Northeast and West, where the president-elect was reviled, and the rural and suburban communities across the country that aligned in an almost uninterrupted swath of Republican red by the time the last votes were counted.\nThis Pennsylvania county is Trump country, where voters awoke Tuesday — finally — to a leader and a nation speaking on their wavelength.\nAdvertisement\nMitt Romney narrowly won Pike County in 2012, netting 2,500 votes on his way to losing the state to Barack Obama. On Tuesday, Trump demolished Clinton in Pike by nearly 2-1: 16,035 votes to 9,247, according to unofficial results.\nHe won the state, and the presidency, by banking huge margins in places a lot like Pike County: largely white, rural, or bedroom towns where people come for housing they can afford, though they probably have to work someplace else.\nFifty-nine-year-old Patrick McCarthy, of Milford, raised three kids, but he and his wife see their own financial prospects dimming with time. He is working three jobs. He staffs the heating and air conditioning store in downtown Milford, he does maintenance at the church, and he works with his wife’s cleaning company. At work at the heating store downtown, he wore a collared shirt and sweater vest.\n“Still doesn’t seem like there’s any money at the end of the month,” he said. “We’re not crazy spenders. We don’t go out; we don’t entertain.”\nTrump, to him, represented a throwback to a time when a guy willing to work could experience a level of comfort — nice home, reasonable salary.\nRomney, he said “spoke well, but looked weak.”\nRich Schultz for The Boston Globe\n“I think he touched something inside of a lot of people,” said John Longendorfer, an artist in Milford, Pa., about Donald Trump.\nBut Trump? He “spoke a little harder; he seemed to have a little more behind it. . . . The way he was talking is the way people used to talk 50 years ago and nobody got offended. They could take it.”\n‘Still doesn’t seem like there’s any money at the end of the month. We’re not crazy spenders. We don’t go out; we don’t entertain.’\nKarena Larsen, 60, a retired legal administrator, pondered the election results and the state of the nation at the Village Diner, outside of downtown. The Trump appeal, so intoxicating to her neighbors, is lost on her. It seems her region is voting against its own interest. She supported Clinton.\n“I would have voted for Jill Stein, but Trump really frightened me,” she said, referring to the Green Party presidential nominee.\nAt the next booth, another Clinton voter, Ruth Rendleman, a 68-year-old music teacher, was so upset by the results she had to take the day off work. She’s from just across the Delaware River in Montague, N.J. “I’m devastated,” she said. “I so wanted to live to see a woman in office. I guess I’m going to have to live a little longer than I planned.”\nBut Clinton voters are in the minority around here.\nAt the Golden Fish Gallery and Museum, John Longendorfer’s eyes widened at the suggestion: Had Donald Trump touched something inside him?\n“Yes! Yes! Yeah!”\n“I think he touched something inside of a lot of people, maybe even something that they didn’t know what it was.”\nLongendorfer is 86. He wears blue jeans and suspenders, and a big silver ring with a cross on it. His untrimmed white eyebrows reach off his forehead. He’s a shopkeeper and an artist, selling zodiac jewelry and swords under the same roof. Before 2008, he said, he made money at his shop. Now? Not so much. “I’m open because I’d rather die here than on the couch,” he said.\nHe says, with some pride, that he comes from a different time. “I consider myself an old-time American,” he said. Trump is a bridge to that time. “I don’t like authority. I obey laws but I don’t like people breathing down my neck — you can’t do this, you can’t do that. I was seeing more and more of that.”\nTrump, he said, raised his feelings of “old-time patriotism,” the JFK-style “ask not” kind of patriotism. “That’s gone now. Everybody has their hand out. If you fixed the economy, you wouldn’t need all these entitlements.”",

      "text": " Google+\nBy Travis Andersen Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nTwo people who drove through Wellesley College on Wednesday waving a Donald Trump flag were removed by campus security for being “disruptive” to students at Hillary Clinton’s alma mater.\nLisa Barbin, chief of the Wellesley College campus police, sent a campus-wide e-mail informing students of the incident.\nAdvertisement\n“This afternoon there were reports of two disruptive individuals driving through campus in a pickup truck with a Donald Trump flag,” Barbin wrote. “We want you to know that College leadership, Campus Police, and Wellesley Town Police were informed, and the individuals were asked to leave College property without incident. As always, your safety is our first priority.”\nThe college did not identify the two individuals. No arrests or injuries were reported.\nGet Fast Forward Clinton is a star alumnus of the elite women’s college. Students and staff gathered to watch election returns, hoping to see the former Secretary of State elected as the nation’s first female president.\nInstead, they wept and prayed late into Tuesday evening that Clinton would pull out a victory over Trump, the Republican nominee.\nClinton’s stunning loss prompted Wellesley College President Paula Johnson to issue a statement, reassuring students that “women’s leadership is the surest way to change the world.”\nAdvertisement\n“We must reaffirm our most deeply felt values as a community: equity, social justice, the embracing of difference, the search for knowledge based on fact, the demand for civil discourse that is inclusive while challenging in its rigor,” Johnson said in a statement posted on the college’s website.\n“Through our actions, our ethics and our perseverance in the face of obstacles, we must show the world that at Wellesley we believe in a path forward for every single person, no matter your race, ethnicity, religion, gender, and no matter what country you came from, your immigration status, socioeconomic background, or political affiliation.”\nTravis Andersen can be reached at tandersen@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nBoston Globe/file 2016\nRepresentative Seth Moulton promised to “fight even harder for the people of Massachusetts.”\nBy Stephanie Ebbert Globe Staff November 09, 2016\nThe day still dawned in Massachusetts, as everyone assured it would.\nBut for a state that resoundingly rejected the man who was just elected president, a state whose leading Democrats had ridiculed Donald J. Trump on Twitter and likened his rise to that of Adolf Hitler, the political prospects sure looked bleak.\nAdvertisement\nThis still-true-blue state voted against Trump by the third-largest margin in the nation and put not one, but two challengers on third-party tickets (Jill Stein and former governor William F. Weld). Massachusetts former governor Mitt Romney made a public service announcement urging his fellow Republicans to renounce Trump last spring. And the current Republican governor, Charlie Baker, proclaimed to the world Tuesday that he cast a blank vote for president, rather than support his party’s nominee.\nMassachusetts enjoyed a good relationship with the Obama White House over the past eight years, and members of the state’s Democratic establishment had already been imagining roles for themselves in a Hillary Clinton administration.\nGet Fast Forward Now, they are considering the very real possibility of four years’ political exile — or even political retribution from Trump, who wrote in a 2007 book, “I love getting even.”\n“I think what worries me is not that Massachusetts will become a target, but that initiatives and programs that benefit Massachusetts and other states will be eliminated or eviscerated,” said US Representative Jim McGovern. “In that sense, we will feel it.”\nBoston Mayor Martin J. Walsh, who played a highly visible role against the incoming president, campaigning on behalf of Clinton, said, “Any time there is a change, you are worried,’’ about federal funding. “We’ll see as time goes on. This is Day One in what will be four years.”\nAdvertisement\nMassachusetts elected officials put a brave face on it Tuesday, gritting their teeth with the same resigned optimism encouraged by Clinton, the losing Democratic standardbearer.\n“It’s time to heal a divided country, come together, improve the economy, make the country great,” said Baker, pointing to the message Trump raised in his victory speech early Wednesday morning. “I think that was exactly the right message, and Senator Clinton echoed that message this morning, and I’m going to pursue a strategy on our end that presumes that that’s in fact what this is all about.”\nDemocrats, too, expressed optimism, tinged by uncertainty, while voicing concerns about the integrity of federal funds for medical research and science that pour into Massachusetts.\nUS Representative Mike Capuano expressed hope that spending levels would be maintained. But he views Massachusetts’ fallen star as the simple price of politics.\n“Philosophically, we just lost. Philosophically, we’re relatively progressive Democrats,” Capuano said. “Our governor is relatively progressive on the Republican scale. Our issues will probably get beat up a little bit.”\nBaker told reporters it was “way too soon to draw conclusions about federal funding. The first thing the Trump-administration-in-waiting is going to have to do is to put a team together,” he said.\nThough Baker was not yet sure who Massachusetts’ point person in a Trump administration would be, he said he had already reached out to congratulate New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, a Trump campaign adviser who is heading his transition. The two Republican governors have supported one another over the years: Baker endorsed Christie in his failed presidential primary campaign earlier this year; Christie, as head of the National Governors Association, helped Baker’s 2014 campaign.\nWhile Trump had Christie, Clinton had Massachusetts US Senator Elizabeth Warren, a popular liberal Democrat, playing the role of attack dog and antagonizing Trump on one of his favorite media, Twitter.\nWarren did not return phone calls to discuss how she intended to work with a President Trump, but she issued a statement saying she intends to do so and that she respects the results of the election.\n“President-Elect Trump promised to rebuild our economy for working people, and I offer to put aside our differences and work with him on that task,” she said in the statement.\nThere was no reaction yet from Trump, who had called Warren “Pocahontas” in a swipe at her claims of Native American ancestry.\nDemocratic US Representative Seth Moulton also provoked Trump in March, comparing his ascension to the rise of Hitler, and warning constituents how easily this nation could “elect a demagogue.” On Wednesday, he called the election “disillusioning” and said it was “a very difficult day.”\n“I’m hearing this from so many of the constituents that I represent,” Moulton said, “that it’s been hard to get out of bed today, hard to go to work, hard to take their kids to school. But we have to remember our fundamental values as Americans and keep fighting for them.”\nMoulton said that Massachusetts’ values, in particular, are “under assault,” pointing to hateful rhetoric and divisions by race.\n“I’m going to fight even harder for the people of Massachusetts,” Moulton said. “But I’m not going to compromise on my values with Trump. I’m not going to back down from his hateful rhetoric. I’m not going to compromise when he wants to take away freedoms from fellow Americans or put our troops at risk overseas. I’m going to stand up to him in Washington just as I stood up to him in this campaign.”\nAsked whether he expects payback from Trump — who spent much of his presidential campaign airing grievances against those who had crossed him — Moulton said, “I don’t know and I don’t care. I think it’s too early to say, but I think if he wants to take on the people of Massachusetts, I think he’s going to lose in the long run. We’re on the right side of history.”\nloading\nElectoral votes 228 Clinton\n31 Undecided\n279 Trump\n59,814,018 votes\n270 to win\n59,611,678 votes\n99.1% reporting\nData source: AP",

      "text": " Google+\nAP Photo/Gerald Herbert\nDonald Trump speaks to retired and active law enforcement personnel at a Fraternal Order of Police lodge during a campaign stop in Statesville, North Carolina.\nBy Michele McPhee November 09, 2016\nShe fought the law and the law won.\nStunned Hillary Clinton supporters wept openly as the electoral map shifted in ways no one could predict and collapsed onto each other’s shoulders decrying the so-called uneducated white vote that catapulted the most unlikely candidate in American history into the White House. But it wasn’t just the hardscrabble deplorables who had a clear message for Washington — frankly, on both sides of the aisle — it was the cops.\nAdvertisement\nThe vote that didn’t show up in the polls, the secret groundswell of support that stunned the media establishment and the pundits and those who proudly stood with her, was not about race or gender or ethnicity. It was about blue.\nSo far in 2016, a staggering 119 police officers have been killed in the line of duty, according to the Officer Down Memorial Page. That number includes 54 shot dead with many of those fatal blasts delivered by killers who targeted cops based on nothing other than the blue uniforms they were wearing. Five in Dallas. Three in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Two in Des Moines.\nGet Todays Headlines Donald Trump, love him or hate him, has been unwavering in his support of police officers. He poses for selfies with every single cop assigned to protect him. He told me in an interview that he supports capital punishment for cop killers, a statement that helped prompt the board of the New England Patrolmen’s Benevolent Association to endorse him early on, one of the first police unions to do it.\nTrump promised Chuck Canterbury, president of the National Fraternal Order of Police, that he would back legislation sponsored by Republican Congressman Ken Buck of Colorado called the Blue Lives Matter Act of 2016 filed in March with little fanfare. In return Canterbury delivered a significant endorsement from the FOP’s 330,000 members, an endorsement that Mitt Romney did not garner in 2012.\nThen came the historic endorsement from the National Border Patrol Council, the union that represents border patrol agents. A union whose 18,000 agents form what they call its green line had never endorsed a candidate for president. Shawn Moran, a border patrol agent and spokesman for the NBPC, said that Trump was the only candidate who met with its board and “promised to give us the support that has been sorely lacking.” And Moran said it wasn’t about the wall. It was about “catch and release,” which the NBPC said has become an alarming problem along the southern borders. Agents catch, but cannot hold, immigrants streaming into the country. Many who enter illegally are given the equivalent of a desk appearance ticket, make a pinky-swear promise to show up for a hearing with immigration officials, and are never seen again.\nAdvertisement\nFor other cops, the silent majority who have watched Hillary Clinton embrace some members of the Black Lives Matter movement, law enforcement officers who were horrified when Dallas County Sheriff Lupe Valdez was interrupted with rude shouts during a moment of silence for her fallen brethren at the DNC Convention, Trump’s win was vindication for those who are doing their jobs without engaging in racial profiling or excessive force.\nI have long predicted that the true Trump voter is not the angry white guy. It’s the civil servants, many of them combat veterans who joined the armed forces after 9/11. They are the ones who have delivered a message to Washington elites on both sides of the aisle: Trump might be crass, but he’s going to take care of us.\nThat sentiment was summed up in a text I got after Clinton’s call to Trump to concede. It read, “Score one for the good guys.”\nMichele McPhee is host of the “Michele McPhee Show’’ on 1510 WMEX Boston. Her next book, “Maximum Harm: the Tsarnaev Brothers, the FBI and the Road to the Marathon Bombings” will be released in April.",

      "text": " Google+\nJessica Rinaldi/Globe Staff\nDonald Trump spoke to supporters in New York early Wednesday.\nBy Amy Forliti and Claire Galofaro Associated Press November 10, 2016\nMENOMONIE, Wis. — On election night, when Donald Trump claimed victory in Wisconsin, Shay Chamberlin was so excited she passed out.\nChamberlain believes Trump is her savior, sent by God to save America from ruin. She owns a women’s clothing store in this remote town; her husband runs a construction company. They have two children and barely get by on $44,000 a year, living paycheck to paycheck.\nAdvertisement\nIn his victory speech, Trump called people like Chamberlain and her family America’s ‘‘forgotten men and women’’ — the blue-collar workers in the manufacturing towns of the Rust Belt and the hallowing coalfields of Appalachia who propelled him to an improbable victory. They felt left behind by progress, laughed at by the elite, and so put their faith in the billionaire businessman with a sharp tongue and short temper who promised to Make America Great Again.\nWhen Trump first ran, Chamberlain thought to herself: ‘‘That’s the man everybody has been praying for.’’ And she now feels vindicated by his victory.\nGet Political Happy Hour ‘‘This is a movement,’’ she said. ‘‘This isn’t a candidate anymore. This is a movement.’’\nNot all of Trump’s support came from the blue-collar downtrodden. But the Republican’s overwhelming backing among whites with less than a college education is at least partly a reflection of how little the economic recovery since the Great Recession has benefited them. Their job opportunities have dwindled and their incomes have fallen, even as broader measures of the nation’s job market show improvement. But they also turned to him to hold back the tide of social change: same-sex marriage, transgender rights, a society growing more racially diverse.\nThe working class, long ignored, found an unlikely spokesman in Donald Trump. He promised to build the wall to keep out immigrants. He promised to tear up trade deals that have ushered American factory jobs overseas. He promised to put blue-collar America back to work restore the country to a time when the white working class felt appreciated and fulfilled.\nAdvertisement\n‘‘I feel like, not just most, but all Trump supporters are true patriots,’’ said 59-year-old Ginger Austin, who owns a graphics company in a tiny town in Jones County, one of the poorest places in North Carolina. ‘‘They love this country. But they’re taking our country away, and they’re changing it. They’re just changing everything. All our rights are just slowly being dwindled away.’’\nShe’s angry at the Republican Party she has supported all her life. She is angry at Obama and the Affordable Care Act. She is angry that America is changing, and worried that her grandchildren are growing up in a world too liberal and too politically correct.\nThe nation woke up Wednesday morning to learn just how starkly divided it has grown: Clinton won the popular vote by less than 200,000 ballots. But Trump won battleground states that had voted for Democrat Barack Obama twice. Thousands of registered Democrats, including many former union workers from the mines and factories, crossed party lines and sided with Trump.\nFor example, in Dunn County, where Shay Chamberlin lives, Barack Obama beat Mitt Romney 53 percent to 46 percent in 2012, and John McCain 57 percent to 42 percent four years earlier. But it flipped to back Donald Trump won, 52 percent to 41 percent, over Hillary Clinton.\nScott Hiltgen, a 66-year-old small business owner in Wisconsin, called Washington a ‘‘cesspool’’ of career politicians, aware and indifferent to the plight of the American worker.\n‘‘We are considered flyover country, as you well know, and they don’t care about us,’’ he said. ‘‘And I think it was the silent majority that finally said, ‘Enough’s enough. We want a change. We don’t like the way things are going.’’’\nMiddle-aged white men with only high school degrees — the core of Trump’s support — saw their inflation-adjusted incomes plummet 9 percent from 1996 through 2014, according to Sentier Research, a data analytics firm founded by former Census Bureau officials. White male college graduates in the same age bracket, by contrast, saw their incomes jump 23 percent.\nThe Great Recession wiped out millions of middle-income jobs in manufacturing, office administrative work and construction, and those jobs haven’t returned, even as the nation now has 6.5 million more jobs than it did before the recession began. In many parts of the country, they have been replaced with lower-income work in restaurants, hotels, and in home health care.\nThis ‘‘hollowing out’’ of the nation’s economy has left many Americans with high school degrees feeling shut out of the middle class.\nJerry Blackburn, a retired county official in rural Virginia, said he feels like people from someplace else took all they could from him and his neighbors and then left them with nothing.\n‘‘They took our coal out of here and everybody rich on it. And what did we get?’’ he asked. ‘‘We got black lung. We don’t have good water to drink, we don’t have roads, we don’t have anything except a bunch of broken down old coal miners that’s forgotten. But everybody else got rich on us.’’\nMiners streamed into a convenience store on a highway between one struggling, West Virginia coal town and another on Wednesday morning. From behind the counter, manager Mary Jones recognized something she hadn’t heard in years: Hope.\nThey talked about jobs returning to this broken-down county. They talked about a chance at a brighter future. They talked about Donald Trump.\n‘‘I think we sent a message to Washington that we’re tired of them sitting up there doing nothing to help the working class people,’’ said Jones, a native of Wyoming County, where the collapse of the coal industry has left behind a string tumbledown houses and a quarter of families in poverty.\nCoal trucks used to barrel by all day and the parking lot stayed full. No trucks come by anymore. The store is for sale. She’s not sure she’ll have a job much longer and is certain she won’t find another. They struggle to make enough money to pay the bills and write the paychecks.\nShe considers the ballot she cast for Trump as a protest against Hillary Clinton and every other member of the political elite.\n‘‘Working-class people built this country and now the working class people have been forgotten,’’ she said. ‘‘It’s about time they paid attention.’’\nBut in West Virginia, Jones worries that the working class is too far gone to be saved.\n‘‘There’s some things you can do as a president. And there’s something you can’t. They all make promises, I just don’t know how he can keep all those promises,’’ she said. ‘‘I feel more hopeful today than I have in a long time. But I’m still scared for the future.’’\nloading\nElectoral votes 228 Clinton\n31 Undecided\n279 Trump\n59,814,018 votes\n270 to win\n59,611,678 votes\n99.1% reporting\nData source: AP",

Walker/Globe staff\nEmma Conrad-Rooney, Allie Collins-Anderson and Vienna Thomas, all first-year students at Wellesley College, watched late election results on campus.\nBy John Hilliard Globe Correspondent November 09, 2016\nWELLESLEY — The party was over Wednesday morning for Wellesley College and its most famous graduate, Hillary Clinton, Class of ‘69.\nThe popcorn and balloons, the thousands of alumni and students who had gathered less than 24 hours earlier in the school gym to watch the election returns, seemed like a lifetime ago on the campus of the women’s college.\nAdvertisement\nBut as freshman Emily Prechtl watched on a small smartphone screen while Clinton gave her concession speech, Prechtl still felt pride in the Democratic presidential candidate. Clinton, she said, showed grace and composure in the final remarks of her hard-fought campaign against Republican Donald Trump.\n“Every woman knows the feeling of being qualified for a job, and losing out to an underqualified man,” said Prechtl. “She had a chance. She won the popular vote.”\nGet Political Happy Hour The festive atmosphere on campus a day earlier gave way to disbelief and apprehension among many students about the nation’s future. But mixed with those feelings, they said, was pride for a graduate of their college who came so close to becoming president of the United States. For most, it was the first presidential election in which they could vote.\nView Story Protests erupt at UMass Amherst After Donald Trump was elected as the next US president, scores of students staged a protest at the UMass Amherst on Wednesday.\nStudents share hopes and fears at MIT At Wellesley, Clinton fans ‘forever Blue’\nClinton appeared to make note of that in her concession speech in New York, directing part of her remarks to young women who supported her and telling them not to give up on “believing that fighting for what’s right is worth it.”\nClinton said she was proud to be the champion of young women in the race, and sounded a hopeful note that a woman will one day serve as president.\nAdvertisement\n“I know we have still not shattered that highest and hardest glass ceiling, but someday, someone will, and hopefully sooner than we might think right now,” Clinton said.\nEven in defeat, Clinton remains a source of pride for students, said sophomore Shannon Dennehy.\n“Her speech was so inspirational to see,” said Dennehy. “She’s not giving up.”\nDennehy said Clinton’s loss hasn’t deterred her from being engaged in politics. “This has made me a political activist,” said Dennehy.\nCiara Wardlow said Clinton showed a “backbone of steel” by calling on Americans to not give up on the political process, despite her shocking defeat to Trump.\nWardlow said she believes third-party candidates like Gary Johnson and Jill Stein helped contribute to Clinton’s defeat by drawing voters away from the Democratic ticket. “I honestly don’t think she could have done or said anything differently to convince those people otherwise,” Wardlow said.\nOther Wellesley students who kept a close watch on the election outcome were disappointed in the outcome, but their faith in Clinton wasn’t shaken.\n“She has spent her entire life dedicated to the love of the American dream since she was a student at Wellesley College and that’s the kind of person we want in charge,” said senior Bridget Walsh.\nSenior Myra Ahmad said Clinton’s experience made her a better choice for president, since she can work with diverse groups, including those who have pushed for gay rights. “She has always been an advocate,” said Ahmad.\nSenior Sarah Koenig said Clinton’s last speech as a presidential candidate was “humble and honest,” and pointed to Clinton’s direct message to women.\n“She ended on a good note, encouraging us to push for what we believe in,” Koenig said.\nJohn Hilliard can be reached at john.hilliard@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff\nTrump supporters in Braintreee were jubilant on election night.\nBy Isvari Mohan Globe Correspondent November 09, 2016\nAs a woman, as a 19-year-old, and as a first-generation American, I am appalled, horrified, disgusted, and shocked by this election. Donald Trump, a man who gropes women, insults minorities, is a narcissist, name-calls opponents, calls for Russia to hack our elections, and insults Gold-star families will be the next president of the United States.\nWhy did he surprise us so much in the primaries and now?\nAdvertisement\nThe answer is as it always is: millennials and other young voters.\nBut not in the way you think. It wasn’t our fault for not voting. It was the media’s fault for caring too much about us.\nGet Business Headlines The New York Times just a few weeks ago put the odds of a Hillary Clinton win at 90 percent. Even the conservative forecaster (conservative in terms of statistics) FiveThirtyEight got the elections incredibly wrong, having Clinton winning with a greater than 70% chance the morning of November 8. Never before have pre-election polls collectively missed the mark like this.\nIn the primaries, Trump surprised people because he connected with a large enough segment of the Republican party to block all other candidates from winning the nomination. But he won Tuesday night because the media greatly underestimated the eventual size of and turnout of that base.\nAs a millennial writer I too am guilty of focusing far too much on what people my age – the future of America – think. But we didn’t matter in this election. Older, white males without a college education did. And polls were so focused on us that they didn’t even think about them.\nAdvertisement\nIn the aftermath of the Brexit, we blamed millennials for not getting out and voting. In 2008, we credited them with Obama’s win. Last night, NBC quickly talked about how a larger percentage of millennials voted for third-party candidates in 2016 (9 percent) than in 2012 (4 percent). This year, if only millennials had voted, Clinton would have won in a landslide. Sure, more of us could have voted and more of us could have voted for her. But it isn’t always millennials’ fault or credit. It’s our ability to vote relative to others.\nThe Clinton campaign and the polls focused unduly on millennials and underestimated the commitment and turnout of older working-class voters. Polls focused on blacks, young people, women, and Hispanics. These groups were studied, discussed, analyzed, and made the subject of countless thought pieces.\nBut white men 45 years and older were taken for granted. They were understudied. Their interests were not often discussed. Grouping them together and analyzing them is something that is not often done, a criticism that created the Trump phenomenon in the first place. By failing to account for voter turnout and “silent majority” interest adequately, the media and the Clinton campaign missed many opportunities to analyze and swing the vote.\nOn Tuesday, it was the unexpected turnout of Trump supporters in red suburbs and rural areas and the unexpected Obama-to-Trump switch of unionized workers that won the election for the underdog.\nAmerica, if we’re going to stereotype every demographic and painfully research their every collective thought, we should have done it for older white men in the same way we did it for young black women. We should have realized how powerful they were, figured out what issues they cared about, and figured out how to change their minds. It was a really close election, where adding 1 percent to Clinton’s vote share and taking away 1 percent from Trump’s would have swung Florida, Pennsylvania, and the election.\nIt’s easy to point blame everywhere today, in a world reeling from shock. But for once, it has nothing to do with us, under-30 hopefuls, not turning out to vote. It has to do with white middle-aged men who did. (And of course, one in particular: James Comey.)\nIf we had all realized that a little earlier, maybe I wouldn’t be spending all of today crying.\nloading\nElectoral votes 228 Clinton\n31 Undecided\n279 Trump\n59,814,018 votes\n270 to win\n59,611,678 votes\n99.1% reporting\nData source: AP",

      "text": " Google+\nDavide Bonazzi for The Boston Globe\n November 10, 2016\nM any residents of Boston woke up in deep despair on Wednesday, especially those from immigrant communities. The election of Donald Trump, a candidate who promises to round up and deport all illegal immigrants, was no ordinary political setback — it felt more like an existential threat.\nThere will be no shortage of commentary in the coming weeks about what Trump’s election means for the nation, and for the world. But a more immediate, personal crisis looms in the city’s neighborhoods, where 27 percent of residents are immigrants . In East Boston, where half of the residents are immigrants — the vast majority of Latino origin — fear was taking hold. One Hispanic community leader woke up Wednesday to texts and calls from Eastie immigrants, who were crying in despair about their future. “Everyone is panicked,” she said. It’s not hyperbole. It’s not just undocumented immigrants feeling nervous. Foreign-born Bostonians expressed fears yesterday that there’s a new normal, one where anti-immigrant sentiment will be tolerated.\nMayor Marty Walsh begs to differ, and he unequivocally sent a message of support to the city as “a son of immigrants.”\nAdvertisement\n“I don’t care what the policies are that come out from the federal government,” Walsh said. “We are going to be a city that respects immigrants, both documented and undocumented.” The mayor added that the city’s Office for Immigrant Advancement will continue to offer programming and initiatives to nurture and support the foreign born in Boston – like citizenship classes and free legal advice . He also encouraged Bostonians not to join in the anti-Trump protests popping up today. “We need more advocacy than protests now” to educate everyone about the contributions of immigrants to the city.\nFor many native-born residents, too, the election results felt like a hammer blow. Trump ran against the qualities that make Boston Boston — diversity, cosmopolitanism — and he won. His election also could have economic consequences for the city and the state , especially if Trump starts the trade wars he has promised.\nGet Todays Headlines The only way for this dark election to generate a silver lining is if it inspires all Bostonians to recommit to the city’s core ideals. Indeed, there’s uplifting evidence that shows local residents are taking concrete actions to counteract Trump’s divisive rhetoric. Wendy Foster, president and CEO of Big Brothers Big Sisters of Massachusetts Bay, reports her organization has received more than 40 volunteer inquiries from the Boston metro area — and counting. The groundswell of support started, she says, “Tuesday evening as the reality of a Trump presidency became evident.” The nonprofit, which matches mentors with kids from low-income and immigrant families in the state’s urban regions, typically gets three to five such inquiries per day.\nImmigrants, including illegal immigrants, are part of this community. Shunning whole religious groups has no place in the 21st century. Tolerance and respect can atrophy into buzzwords, until a day like Tuesday reminds us how fragile and precious they really are.\nView Story Women should listen to Clinton “We must accept this result and then look to the future,” Hillary Clinton said in her concession speech.\nWhat have we done?\nBoston isn’t the only city struggling to make sense of Tuesday’s election. The people of America have spoken. But now, by forcefully resisting the forces that Trump has unleashed and supporting one another, the people of Boston can send their own message.",

He is a machine,” said Boch, a Republican. “He is going to be great for the country.”\nTrump attended a raucous rally hosted by Boch at his Norwood mansion in 2015, back when the Republican was considered a long shot to win the White House. Even after Trump became the GOP nominee, it was hard to find prominent business leaders who publicly supported such a divisive candidate.\nGet Business Headlines Boch, the CEO of Subaru of New England, knew he would be in Japan this week in an annual meeting with the automaker’s parent company, so he took advantage of early voting and cast his ballot Friday.\n“The Democrats were truly afraid of Mr. Trump,” said Boch. “People who voted for him – the regular people and I – are not in fear of Mr. Trump.”\nThe car king said he believed Trump can get a lot done in his administration. “He’s got the House, he’s got the Senate. It’s beautiful,” said Boch.\nShirley Leung is a Globe columnist. She can be reached at shirley.leung@globe.com . Follow her on Twitter @leung .",

      "text": " Google+\nJIM DAVIS/GLOBE STAFF\nProponents of Question 2 gathered at Foley’s Irish Pub and Restaurant to watch the election results.\nBy James Vaznis Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nA majority of voters in nearly every Massachusetts community — including all the state’s cities — rejected the ballot question to expand charter schools, exceeding the worst-case scenario of supporters who hoped it would at least pass in urban areas.\nThe trouncing puts the future of the charter-school movement into limbo and raises questions about whether supporters should have taken the issue directly to voters to get around a legislative stalemate, resulting in the nation’s most expensive ballot question campaign ever.\nAdvertisement\n“This may have been a Hail Mary pass that shouldn’t have been made,” said Michael Petrilli, president of the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, a policy institute supportive of charter schools. “I would have a hard time finding any argument that charters came out ahead on this one.”\nAnd supporters may have lost the chance to go back to the Legislature to pursue another lift in the state’s cap on charter schools — at least anytime in the near future — as legislative leaders expressed little appetite to take it up again.\nGet Fast Forward “The public has spoken loud and clear on this one,” Senate President Stanley Rosenberg, who opposed the ballot question, said Wednesday. “It will be very difficult for them to get any attention given how strongly the vote was.”\nSeth Gitell, spokesman for House Speaker Robert Deleo, who supported the ballot question, said simply, “the voters have spoken.”\nWarning bells went off by late summer that charter supporters could suffer a crushing defeat at the ballot box. Poll numbers at that time were trending down.\nAdvertisement\nAlthough proponents were better financed, opponents were winning the battle of converting the undecideds by sticking to a simple message: more charter schools would drain money from traditional schools. And they were armed with a ready-to-go ground game led by teacher unions with members in every community and more than 200 school committees willing to take public votes against a cap lift.\nIn the end, 62 percent of voters rejected the question, while 38 percent supported it.\nNot everyone believes future efforts to raise the cap are dead. Some advocates point out that many elected officials who support charter schools opposed the measure because they believed charters would grow too much too quickly. The ballot question would have allowed up to 12 new charters a year statewide regardless of any caps.\nA more modest proposal in the Legislature could be more successful, they said.\n“This is not going to stop charter school expansion,” said Marty Walz, chairwoman of the advisory council of Democrats for Education Reform. “Voters simply rejected a specific question, which was a broad expansion of charter schools.”\nThe vote hasn’t halted charter school growth entirely because many communities have not reached their state-imposed limits. But several cities are near or at their caps. Boston, for instance, has room to add only 250 seats for next fall.\nIn Georgia on Tuesday, voters rejected a constitutional amendment to allow the state to seize control of chronically failing schools.\nBut there have been successes. Voters in Washington State, for instance, approved a law to establish the state’s first charter schools in 2012, after three previous measures had failed.\nIn Massachusetts, charter school supporters repeatedly had threatened to take expansion efforts to voters if they didn’t get their way in the Legislature. Supporters resorted to the tactic seven years ago and then dropped it after lawmakers agreed to double charter-school enrollment in the lowest-performing districts.\nMarc Kenen, executive director of the Massachusetts Charter School Association, said Wednesday that advocates have no regrets about pursuing this year’s ballot question, but acknowledged it is unlikely the Legislature will take up an expansion bill in the near future.\n“We are so committed to helping families who need better educational opportunities for their children that we have to try everything we can,” he said.\nKenen said he thinks the vote failed by such a large margin because opponents framed the debate as a choice between charters or district schools, and that voters perceived that charters might do financial harm to their own schools.\nAdvocates attempted to blunt the debate on the funding issue by airing ads saying that charter schools would provide more money for public education.\nThat tactic was a bit misleading. While school systems receive a limited amount of state reimbursements for students who go to charter schools, districts need to find other ways to recoup the money that is lost when per-student aid follows students to charter schools.\nIn an era when many communities statewide have approved tax increases to support the rising cost of education, the message that charter schools drain money from local schools appears to have resonated with many voters.\nEileen O’Connor, spokeswoman for Great Schools Massachusetts, which was behind the ballot question, declined to comment Wednesday on the vote.\nUnion leaders said Wednesday they hope the charter debate will provide momentum to stalled efforts to revamp the state’s school funding formula and provide more money to schools, especially in urban areas where schools are serving large populations of students who are poor or those with significant disabilities or limited fluency in English.\n“It does generate a conversation that needs to continue about education funding and what we want our schools to look like,” said Barbara Madeloni, president of the Massachusetts Teachers Association.\nJames Vaznis can be reached at jamres.vaznis@globe.com .",

      "text": " Google+\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff\nLawrence Pease walked around downtown Middleborough on Wednesday. Pease, 67, said he wanted a president who was different and would tighten immigration policies.\nBy Laura Krantz Globe Staff November 10, 2016\nMIDDLEBOROUGH — People across Massachusetts met Donald Trump’s victory with general shock and dismay. But in this working-class, reliably Republican town, Trump’s stunning election felt like a new day.\nAlong downtown streets here, Trump supporters said they are desperate for change, fed up with feeling forgotten by the federal government and betrayed by politicians. For them, a Trump presidency carries a sense of possibility.\nAdvertisement\n“I’m feeling hope for the future,” said Steven Meleo, 61, a downtown business owner. Trump’s election provided the “opening that we need for something new” to take hold, he said.\nMeleo grew up in this rural town, about 40 miles south of Boston, when it bustled with hardware shops, clothing stores, restaurants, and antique boutiques. Looking out his front window Wednesday, he saw empty storefronts.\nGet Fast Forward “We need people to spread some money,” he said.\nTrump received about one-third of the vote statewide, but won 54 percent in Middleborough, part of a cluster of towns south of Boston that traditionally vote Republican. Four years ago, Republican nominee Mitt Romney took 56 percent of the vote here.\nThe town’s economy has struggled in recent years, many said, particularly after plans for a casino fell through in 2012 . Meleo recently expanded his marine electronics repair company to include snowblower and lawnmower services, looking to bring in more business.\nAdvertisement\nMeleo’s main reason for backing Trump was the hope of lower taxes. His business is already squeezed, he said, and he can’t afford to pay his workers higher wages.\nHe also sells decorative signs with patriotic emblems and sayings, popular items in a town that honors its veterans, he said. With the Veterans Day parade coming up, small American flags covered the Town Hall lawn and blue ribbons hung around light poles.\nLawrence Pease, 67, a Vietnam War veteran, said he was tired of the “same old, same old.” He wanted a president who was different and would tighten immigration policies.\n“America has spoken,” he said. “We’re just sick of the old politics.”\nEven in a Republican stronghold, some said they were hesitant to let their support for Trump be known. Several business owners said they feared a backlash from customers.\n“You just keep your mouth quiet,” said Robert Giardino, 52, as he walked down Webster Street near the Congregational church. Giardino couldn’t say exactly why he supported Trump, or what he hopes he will accomplish.\nOther supporters made it clear their opposition to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton was their primary motivation.\n‘America has spoken. We’re just sick of the old politics.’\n“Do I believe Donald Trump to be a great guy? Absolutely not. I got a lot of issues with him,” said James Thomasson, 48, a pastor at the MeetingHouse Church. “But I had different issues with Clinton.”\nTerry Laspesa, 70, left Honey Dew Donuts with a coffee, wearing a shirt with an American flag on it.\nShe said she voted for Trump because she is Catholic and opposes abortion. She dismissed Trump’s remarks disparaging women as “men talk.”\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff\nFifty-four percent of the town’s voters supported Donald Trump, but not Kostas Palaiologos.\nAlmost 40 percent of Middleborough voters chose Clinton, and some expressed concern over Trump’s victory.\n“For the first time in my life, I am scared,” said Dee, a 57-year-old black woman who asked that her last name not be used because she fears retribution from other people in town. “There’s a lot of closet racism in this town.”\nDee said she has three children and 12 grandchildren, and fears for their future.\nSmoking a cigarette outside a downtown business where she works, Dee said she had seen Confederate flags in town before this election, but never so many.\n“I can’t even believe he won,” she said. “Everybody I know is crying.”\nKostas Palaiologos, 78, a tailor from Greece who owns Middleboro Alterations on Main Street, said he voted for Clinton. It bothered him that while he and other small businesses struggle, Trump apparently avoided paying taxes on his millions.\n“I hope [Trump] can be fair,” he said as he mended a navy blue pinstriped suit. “Like other presidents were.”\nJohn Tlumacki/Globe Staff\nDee said she is afraid and would move out if she could.\nLaura Krantz can be reached at laura.krantz@globe.com .

      "text": " Google+\nScott Stewart/AP/File\nRepublican President Ronald Reagan talks with Democratic House Speaker Thomas \"Tip\" O&apos;Neill Jr. in the Oval Office.\nBy Thomas P. O’Neill III November 09, 2016\nDenial. Anger. Acceptance.\nI will admit to being shaken by the outcome of this presidential election. The surprise of the result no doubt a contributing factor in the depth of emotion many of us feel.\nAdvertisement\nMany among us in the Democratic Party will need some time to resolve our emotions, but I implore us all to move past the first phases of grief, to acceptance—and to action. Our nation, our collective interest in this great experiment that is America demands that of us.\nThirty-six years ago I sat with my father. We watched in stunned silence as Ronald Reagan rolled up a massive election victory, attracting millions of voters that had been the backbone of the Democratic Party since FDR. There are lessons to be learned from that past, when Ronald Reagan was the conservative Republican president, and my father the liberal Speaker of the House.\nGet Todays Headlines President Reagan and my father, ideological opposites with diametrically opposed views of government, both understood the importance of moving America forward through negotiation and compromise. The President knew that he and the GOP-led Senate needed to work with the House if they were going to enact elements of their agenda approved by the voters’ judgment. And House leadership, at the behest of my father, made a conscious decision that they had not been elected solely to oppose the passage of legislation.\nWhat have we done? I’m not going to lie to you. What happened on Tuesday night is terrifying.\nThe House leaders, no doubt shocked and hurt, respected the voters’ choice—the active and free choice being the very cornerstone of our democracy. That acceptance allowed those men and women to move America forward, enacting serious legislation on a range of issues – Social Security, taxes, national defense and relations with the Soviet Union.\nAs I call on my fellow Democrats to embrace acceptance, I can only hope that President-elect Trump embraces the magnitude of his responsibility—the hallowed obligation the office of the presidency confers on its occupants. I have seen men and women transformed by that responsibility when it is conferred upon them.\nAdvertisement\nUnlike the election of 1984 in which President Reagan received eight million more votes than Vice President Mondale, our country today is evenly divided. The President-elect must reach out, and we in the opposition must grasp his hand.\nThe people running the government in Washington don’t have to agree on everything – and they don’t have to like each other, but their actions must be guided by a commitment to serve all Americans. We must get past assigning our citizens to categories—Muslims, LGBTQ, millennials, disaffected working men and women. We must avoid the reflex to act only as impediment.\nOur Democratic Party has lost touch with people who were once the backbone of our party, and it for them whom we must act.\nI believe in the great experiment that is America, and I believe that over the next four years we can find a path that offers voters hope—the hope of a good job, of a belief the future can be brighter than the present, that their children’s lives might be better than their own. For far too many, this recession has never ended and we as Democrats failed to see voters’ frustration, their suffering.\nCompromise. Cross the aisle. Work for the good of America wherever you find that you can do it together. Build, and in building bring back the middle class.\nBut we must do that while holding tight to our deepest moral values. We cannot succeed as a party, or a country, if we pit one group against another or if we help some groups while disadvantaging others. If we infringe upon the rights of any segment of our citizens we weaken us all, and we weaken this great experiment we call America.\nOur challenge is great, but history shows that if we are able to see each other as individuals, to engage in genuine conversation and sit across from one another and attempt to understand each other’s motivations, then we can find paths to agreement.\nMy father and President Reagan didn’t always like each other, but they respected each other and above all they respected the extraordinary reality and potential of our country.\nI urge us all, and particularly the President-elect and our leaders in Congress, to put aside the nasty Tweets borne of anger and resentment and move toward acceptance, to join one another in respectful disagreement. These are deeply trying times, but we have it within ourselves to move forward for the good of us all.",

      "text": "Google’s miniature radars can now identify objects Researchers from St Andrews University teach Google's tech a fun new trick share When Google unveiled Project Soli in 2015, the company presented it as a way to create gesture controls for future technology . Soli’s miniature radars are small enough to fit into a smartwatch and can detect movements with sub-millimeter accuracy, allowing you to control the volume of a speaker, say, by twiddling an imaginary dial in mid-air. But now, a group of researchers from the University of St Andrews in Scotland have used one of the first Project Soli developers kits to teach Google’s tech a new trick: recognizing objects using radar. \nEvery object has a unique radar fingerprint The device is called RadarCat (or Radar Categorization for Input and Interaction), and works the way any radar system does. A base units fires electromagnetic waves at a target, some of which bounce off and return to base. The system times how long it takes for them to come back and uses this information to work out the shape of the object and how far away it is. But because Google’s Soli radars are so accurate, they can not only detect theexteriorof an object, but also its internal structure and rear surface. \"These three sets of signals together gives you the unique fingerprint for each object,\" lead researcher Professor Aaron Quigley tells The Verge . RadarCat is accurate enough that it can even tell the difference between the front and back of a smartphone, or tell whether a glass is full or empty. This system is surprisingly accurate, but there are some major limitations. For example, RadarCat does occasionally confuse objects with similar material properties (for example, the aluminum case of a MacBook and an aluminum weighing scale), and while it works best on solid objects with flat surfaces, it takes a little longer to get a clear signal on things that are hollow or oddly shaped. (For more information, check out the full study published by St Andrews.) RadarCat also has to be taught what each object looks like before it can recognize it, although Quigley says this isn’t as much of a problem as it initially appears. He compares it to music CDs: \"When you first started using them, you put in the CD and it would come up with song list. That information wasn’t recorded on the CD, but held in a database in the cloud, with the fingerprint of the CD used to do the lookup.\" Once the information has been introduced to the system once, says Quigley, it can be easily distributed and used by . And the more information we have about various radar fingerprints, the more we can generalize and make inferences about never-before-seen objects. One of the most obvious applications of this research is to create a dictionary of things. Visually impaired individuals could use it to identify objects that feel similar in shape or size, or it could deliver more specialized information — identifying a phone model, for example, and quickly bringing up a list of specs and a user manual. If RadarCat’s abilities were added to electronics, then users could trigger certain functions based on context — hold your RadarCat-enabled phone in a gloved hand, for example, and it could switch to an easy-to-use user interface with large icons. \nUnlike the internet of things, radar works without Wi-Fi Of course, much of the current wave of tech (specifically the Internet of Things) is concerned with creating smart objects and environments. However, RadarCat’s approach has the advantage of being unobtrusive. You don’t have to add extra information to an object to recognize it (like QR codes) and you don’t have to give it an Wi-Fi connection either (a practice that’s a security nightmare and even threatens the stability of the internet itself ). The next step for RadarCat’s creators is to improve the system’s ability to distinguish between similar objects, suggesting they could use it to not only say whether a glass is full or empty, for example, but also classify its contents. If the technology ever moves into mainstream use it would be quite the evolution — from a military tech used to detect ships and airplanes, to a consumer one that can tell you exactly what you’re about to drink.

      "text": "Google takes a stand against proprietary fast-charging in Android devices Google takes a stand against proprietary fast-charging in Android devices By Joel Hruska on November 10, 2016 at 7:30 am Comment \nFor the past few years, a number of smartphones have offered so-called “fast charging” solutions. These options are meant to charge the device rapidly (Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 is one such example). Earlier this year, we discussed how USB-C and QuickCharge 3.0 were incompatible , thanks to their different requirements for device voltage. The USB-C specification prohibits changing Vbus voltage, which is what Qualcomm does to hit its fast charge targets. Now Google is formally changing its best practices that it recommends for Android, and it doesn’t sound like a solution Qualcomm or other quick-charge technology companies will be happy with. \nIn its new Android Compatibility Guide for Android 7.0 (Nougat), Google states the following: \nType-C devices are STRONGLY RECOMMENDED to not support proprietary charging methods that modify Vbus voltage beyond default levels, or alter sink/source roles as such may result in interoperability issues with the chargers or devices that support the standard USB Power Delivery methods. While this is called out as “STRONGLY RECOMMENDED”, in future Android versions we might REQUIRE all type-C devices to support full interoperability with standard type-C chargers. \nNo reason has been provided for the change, but it could be related to the general uncertainty we’ve seen in the USB-C market. Right now, you’ve got a great many cables manufactured to particular standards, with all of this poorly communicated to end users. That’s before we even touch the problem of bad cables in and of themselves. It’s entirely possible that Google is taking this step because an improperly constructed cable, combined with a Quick Charge service, can do some significant harm to a device. USB-C is theoretically capable of handling all these standards, but getting compatibility fixed has been dodgy. \nWhat Google is chasing here is the idea of USB-C as a truly universal standard, where the cables all work with all of the devices. We’ve seen more problems here than I honestly anticipated — I don’t remember anyone putting USB 3.0 under the same kind of limelight, but then USB 3.0 wasn’t trying to be all things to all people. The fact that USB-C can tackle everything from HDMI, to peripheral attachments (via Thunderbolt 3) means that the number of parts that can connect to the same port has leapt upwards. But as we discussed yesterday, these cables aren’t always fungible, and the cables that can do everything are significantly more expensive. Users who typically buy the cheapest cables, be warned — that’s not going to work this time around. \nQualcomm has always maintained that its charging is fine and presents no risk to any Android devices, and to be fair, we’ve never heard of any failures. Nonetheless, if Google squashes the standard altogether and starts requiring full compatibility, it could dent the fast-charging market and result in fewer devices being released — at least until someone figures out a different way around the problem that doesn’t require changing the Vbus.

      "text": "print \nAlexis Ohanian, speaking at Web Summit in Lisbon. Lara O'Reilly/Business Insider \nGoogle attempted to acquire Reddit back in the site's early days in 2005, cofounder Alexis Ohanian said at a press conference at Web Summit in Lisbon on Thursday. \nIn response to a question from Business Insider about why the deal never happened, Ohanian said that the deal broke down because he and cofounder Steve Huffman didn't want to become Googlers. \nWhen Google got in touch, Ohanian and Huffman were both 22-years-old and had only just graduated from college at the University of Virginia. \nGoogle had proposed using Reddit to power the comments sections on its properties. Google acquired YouTube in 2006 — and Ohanian said Google had wanted to use Reddit for this purpose on the video site too. \nOhanian said: \"We had just graduated from UVA, and four or five months later we had Chris Sacca [who then served as Google's head of special initiatives, but went on to become a billionaire investor, having made angel investments in Photobucket and Twitter] ... which was pretty cool.\" \nOhanian declined to reveal how much money Reddit turned down, but said the idea was that the deal was supposed to be an acqui-hire. \n\"The reason it didn't go through ... you know, at that time it was just me and Steve. We had raised $82,000 in total at that point. We thought that was amazing, we were going to live off that for years, that was great — we didn't think about hiring anyone, which was dumb. The offer was incredibly tempting,\" Ohanian said. \nBut the decision came down to one question: \"Do we really want to become Google employees?\" \nOhanian said: \"We weren't big enough to justify a YouTube-style acquisition, where you do your own thing and have your own little world to operate. We were two dudes in an apartment: Do we want to become Google employees? As amazing as those perks were in 2005 — Google was the place to work — it wasn't something we wanted to do quite yet.\" \nA Google spokesperson told Business Insider the company does not comment on speculation. \nReddit was eventually acquired by \"Wired\" publisher Condé Nast in 2006, but in 2011 it began operating as a separate subsidiary of Condé Nast parent company Advance Publications. \nIn September this year, YouTube overhauled its comments section by adding moderators and starting to thread conversations to make them easier to follow. \nAlexis Ohanian. Getty Images \nOhanian said he hopes that YouTube continues to improve its comment section, which he described as \"pretty terrible, really bad\" because they lack context. \nUsing a sports example, he explained that on Reddit, posts around a match between two soccer teams usually have three separate conversations: Fans of the home team, fans of the away team, and neutral sports fans. \n\"[But on YouTube, the comments section] lives devoid of context: Everyone comes to just shout: 'Go Arsenal!' 'Go Man U! 'I like turtles'.\" \nReddit is also planning a design overhaul of its own. While it recently launched mobile apps and a mobile web experience, the desktop site has largely looked the same for years. \nOhanian said: \"Desktop changes are coming. We are always, always, always going to prioritize functionality over design. What I mean is there are millions of beautiful websites that nobody uses. A beautiful website alone is not going to bring hundreds of millions of users — the content has to be the reason for people to come. But it can look good, and it will look good, I promise.\"",

And if you’re still on the fence about the future of Google+ or its value to marketers today, I’d love to share five reasons why Google+ could be interesting for you to try. \n\n\n \nTo make Google+ marketing as easy as possible for you , we’re proud to say that starting today you can connect your personal Google+ profile to Buffer , along with any of your Google+ pages, and fully manage your Google+ presence alongside Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn, and Pinterest all from the Buffer dashboard.\nNow, onto the five good reasons to make time for Google+ posting.\n1. Google+ content gets indexed immediately and shows up in search results You’ve likely heard that Google+ pages and profiles can greatly help your SEO, and it’s true!\nGoogle+ is a powerful search engine marketing tool for companies, influencers, and your own personal branding. Sharing blog posts on Google+ in particular is an excellent way to …\nRank for keyword terms that you might otherwise not be able to Drive search traffic to your Google+ profile and then back to your blog and website Sometimes it happens without even realizing it. Such was the case for Patrik Antinozzi of Rapid Web Launch who ended up in the search results for Pokemon Go thanks to his Google+ post.\n\nHow does this Google+ ranking boost happen?\nWell, rumor has it that Google crawls and indexes content posted to Google+ almost immediately. Here’s what Moz found :\nIf you share new content on Google+, chances are that Google will index the page very quickly.\nRumor has it that new URLs are crawled almost instantly. This makes complete sense as part of the purpose of Google+ was to replace Twitter when creating Google’s Realtime Search. \nIn the old days, if you wanted a website indexed you filled out a webform and waited several weeks. Today, it’s as simple as pressing a +1 button.\nContent that you post to Google+ is far more likely to show up in search results than other pages, websites, articles, and content posted to other social networks because Google ranks their own social network higher and they crawl it faster. The added benefit is that Google even previews certain Google+ posts with rich snippets (profile picture, media, etc.), giving them even more real estate in a search!\nAs Laura Donovan shared in her Business2Community article on Google+ :\nWhile our company Google Plus page does not have a lot of followers, it does seem to give us a boost when it comes to how visible our blog posts are in Google searches.\nIs there a catch?\nWell, you do need to build a network on Google+ using Google+ Circles. The more people you add to circles and the more people who add you to their circles, the more likely you are to show up in search results for your network. Imagine if every person you emailed got added to a Google+ circle? You’d have a list of friends, family, colleagues, prospective leads, business partners, and much more who would see your content first! The broader your network on Google+ the more likely you are to show up in search results.\nHow can you take advantage of this? It’s pretty simple!\n1. Make sure your Google+ personal profile and/or your Google+ page is fully complete. \nWhy bother? Well, Google indexes this information. This is an ideal place to make sure that Google knows who you are (and for those who find you on Google+ to know where to click to learn more).\n\nIn order to fill this out completely, you can:\nHead to your Google+ personal profile, hit “Edit Profile” then click the “I” icon to go to your About Me page. From there you can add your introduction and use words that relate to your brand in your tagline and about section If you hit the + at the bottom of the page, you can add relevant sites and include links to your website or blog Double check that the privacy for your introduction and sites is set to “Public” or whatever you are most comfortable with 2. Grab your custom URL with your full name or business name \nAfter you claim your custom URL (you can follow the instructions here for desktop and mobile), it’ll be even easier to extend your branding into the search results since Google indexes the URLs, too.\n3. Stay active on Google+ \nMake sure all of your recent blog content is being shared there, plus any relevant curated articles you wish to share. (It’s as simple as Buffering it now!)\n4. Share your own blog posts, using the blog post title, immediately after they’re published \nThis is the fastest way to get your URL indexed and crawled to rank on Google search. Take care when sharing to Google+ to include the full title of post and even a small description to make ranking even more likely to be indexed and ranked.\n5. Keep building your circles \nThe more people you have in your circles, the more likely you are to show up in search results! One idea: You could add everyone you email to a Google+ circle.\n—\n2. Everyone You Email Can See Your Google+ Profile One billion people use Gmail every month . Are you one of them? If you aren’t, you’re probably emailing with a bunch of them!\nAnd here’s the great benefit of Google+ and Gmail: Your Google+ profile appears in every one of the emails you send, for whoever opens your email in Gmail on desktop.\nIt’s this information, right here:\n\nHave you ever tried clicking on someone’s photo in an email and had it take you to their Google+ profile?\nI’ve done that quite a few times when I’m looking to find out more about someone, and it’s always awesome when their bio is filled out and from there I can find their website, other social handles, or just generally learn more about them.\nHow can you optimize this?\nAdd a photo to your Google+ profile Optimize your Google+ profile by including: Links Bio Workplace Anything else you’d like to tell people This way if your profile gets clicked, it contains all of the relevant information someone might be looking for and is a strong start to making sure your profile and content shows up in search.\nBonus: Maintaining an active presence on Google+ will also give people more content to click through and more context to learn about you.\n—\n3. There’s a Very Specific, Engaged Demographic on Google+ (Maybe Your Target Audience!) It’s hard to pin down exactly how many people are using Google+, recent numbers say 375 million monthly users , whereas other places mentions between 4 – 6 million active users and in total there are 2.2 billion profiles since every new Gmail account ends up creating a Google+ profile as well.\nIt looks more likely that people enjoy using Google+ to host their photos, with 1.5 billion photos uploaded every week. I’ve done this myself as not all of my friends and family are on Facebook or Instagram, but they all have Gmail and can view the photos that way.\nRegardless of how many people are using Google+, they are an active bunch. Google Communities in particular now average 1.2 million new joins per day !\nWhat I found most interesting is the key demographics from those active Google+ users.\n\nIt’s common to hear that Google+ is great for reaching people in tech and it could be true based on these demographics.\nThis beautiful infographic from Sprout Social explains a bit more what demographics look like for other social networks:\n\nBased on these there are a few things to note:\nGoogle+ has the highest ratio for men on social media at 73% And in particular, men in the United States with that as the location for 55% of users Based on stats describing the top occupations , it’s likely 78% of Google+ users work in a role related to tech. If that’s your target audience, then you’ll definitely have a higher likelihood of reaching them. Even if it isn’t, Google+ still has millions of active monthly users, who’s to say they won’t be interested in your brand or company?\n—\n4. Google+ Communities are Powerful (and Popular) Google recently released the numbers for communities on Google+ as having 1.2 million daily new community joins .\nSo what is a community on Google+? According to Google :\nCommunities can have more than one owner and moderator, and other people can join that community When you’re a member of a community, you can post to that community. Members of that community may see your posts in their home stream. If you’re still starting out on Google+ and don’t quite have a following yet, posting content to communities is a great way to build an audience. Some workplaces also use Google+ communities as an internal social network for employees.\nThere are tons of active Google+ communities, here are just a few examples:\nLandscape Photography , with nearly 1 million members \n\nSEO and Internet Marketing , with over 150,000 members\nSocial Media for Entrepreneurs , with over 135,000 members\nFunny Videos and Pictures , with over 2.5 million members\nBody Building , with over 440,000 members\n—\n5. These 10 Major Brands and Influencers Are Seeing Success on Google+ Scrolling through Google+, I easily came across many brands and influencers who have enormous followings. NASA and National Geographic use Google+ to share stunning photos, the Dalai Lama shares his message with nearly 7.5 million followers and gets great engagement, Evernote has a colorful profile with popular, active collections and communities on their page.\nGoogle+ is a great space to build a following with a lot less competition and noise than some other social networks. The added benefits from SEO ranking and visibility in Gmail, make it all the more attractive.\nHere are 10 brands and influencers doing well on Google+ to serve as inspiration:\nNational Geographic Evernote NASA Dalai Lama Arianna Huffington Van Gogh Museum Globe and Mail H & M BMW PlayStation —\nPlus, It’s Never Been Easier To Share Your Content to Google+ We’re excited to announce that you can now connect your Google+ personal profiles with your Buffer account! It’ll only take a click to add the content you’re already sharing on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, Instagram or Pinterest and send it out to Google+ as well.\nConnect your Google+ personal profile with your Buffer account here . \nI’ve been making sure to share everything that goes on LinkedIn (since that’s where I do thought leadership) on Google+ as well as to start getting the SEO benefits.

      "title": "Google's Daydream View VR headset is promising, but just a start",
      "text": "Google's Daydream View VR headset is promising, but just a start Watch out, Gear VR. Share Save \nIt was only a matter of time until Google moved on from Cardboard and started taking virtual reality seriously. Say hello to the Daydream View , the company's first mobile VR headset. Much like Samsung's Gear VR , it's powered by Android. But the big difference is that this $79 headset will work across a wide variety of Android phones that support Google's Daydream platform; it won't just be stuck on Samsung's hardware. It also stands out from the competition with a more comfortable design made from cloth instead of plastic. There's a lot riding on this headset and Daydream in general, but can Google really compete with VR companies that have been developing hardware for years? For the most part, it turns out it can. Gallery: Google Daydream View | 13 Photos 13 +9 Hardware \nThere are so many mobile VR headsets out there now that they're starting to feel a bit boring. The Gear VR, built by Samsung in collaboration with Oculus, set the stage with its original design. It turns out when you're doing mobile VR, you really just need a comfortable way to hold the phone to your face and some decent lenses to refocus the screen. The Daydream View changes up the formula a bit, though, with its soft cloth-covered case. That might seem a bit odd at first, but it makes a lot of sense. VR headsets are basically wearables, and fabric simply feels more comfortable than plastic. (We saw something similar with the PlayStation VR, which uses a soft cloth material around its eyepiece.) \nHooking up a phone to the Daydream View is also simpler than any other headset I've seen. You just need to open up the front latch, drop the phone in with the screen facing the lenses and then close up everything and secure it with an elastic band on the top. It might look a bit clunky, but it's fairly secure. After that, tighten the headband, slip the Daydream View over your head, and readjust as necessary. Instead of using velcro straps, Google's headset relies on a band that's more like a messenger bag strap. It's fairly comfortable, but adjusting it is a bit tougher than simply dealing with velcro. \nKeeping the theme of comfort going, the eyepiece is also made out of a soft and cushiony material. Best of all, you can actually remove the eyepiece for hand washing. Which is a good thing: Based on my experiences with other headsets, you can bet it's going to get sweaty and grimy quickly. Since it's relying on fabric on top of a plastic frame, the Daydream View comes in at a feather-light 220 grams (0.48 pounds). The Gear VR, on the other hand, weighs 345 grams (0.76 pounds). \nAnother way Google aims to differentiate itself is with the Daydream View's motion controller. Like a vastly simplified version of HTC's and Oculus's remotes, you use it to navigate around Daydream's interface, play games and interact with apps. The motion tracking is generally pretty accurate, though I noticed some issues as its battery life drained down. The remote's simple layout -- touchpad on top, an app-specific button in the middle, a home button on the bottom, and volume controls on the sides -- also make it easy to use while your eyes are covered. It charges over USB-C too, which is a nice touch since your Daydream device will likely charge that way as well. \nSpeaking of compatible phones, for now you can choose from Google's Pixel or Pixel XL to power the Daydream View. Other manufacturers are currently working on their own entries, though there's nothing you can actually buy yet. Google says Daydream phones will generally offer high-resolution displays (you can bet they'll likely be AMOLED, since that works best for VR); \"high-fidelity sensors\" for head tracking; and \"ultra smooth\" graphics. You'll also want to pay attention to resolution differences between Daydream devices. The Pixel XL has a 1,440p (2K) display, for example, while the smaller Pixel has a less impressive 1080p display. In general, the more pixels you can stuff into a screen the sharper your VR experience will be. In use \nI tested the Daydream View with the Pixel XL, likely because Google wanted to show off its VR headset in the best possible light. Since the XL is such a large phone though, it sticks out a bit when it's attached to the Daydream View. It still fit just fine, but the setup looks a bit unpolished. (Then again, the Gear VR looks even worse with a phone plugged in.) On the bright side, the Daydream View's single elastic band did a fine job of holding the Pixel XL in place, even when I shook the headset like crazy. \nOnce you launch the Daydream app and slap the phone into a headset, you're presented with a fairly typical home screen. It features recently used apps and your own shortcuts up front, and a button on the bottom of the screen leads to your entire library. At launch, Google has a handful of its own VR apps to explore: With YouTube VR, you can view normal videos on a flat or curved plane, or dive right into immersive 360-degree videos. Street View lets you take virtual strolls around famous locations. And Play Movies allows you to you use the Daydream View like your own personal home theater. Third-party apps include the Wall Street Journal , Star Chart VR and games like Mekorama and Hunter's Gate . \nQuality-wise, VR experiences in Google's headset look and feel just as good as the Gear VR. I had a blast sifting through 360-degree YouTube videos. And I'm pretty sure Mekorama could end up becoming a killer app for the platform. It tasks you with moving a robot around a small 3D space (similar to the hit mobile game Monument Valley ), but being able to play it in virtual reality makes it truly addictive. The Wall Street Journal's app places you in an expensive Midtown NYC apartment, where you can explore its VR content, watch videos, and, for some reason, read articles. (I'll save words for my boring old non-VR screens, thank you very much.) \nAs with most VR headsets, games looked better than interactive videos, with sharp graphics and no noticeable slowdown in the apps I tested. Videos looked fine, but they're still mostly held back by the lack of high-quality VR cameras on the market. And while I'm sure some people will enjoy watching traditional 2D videos in VR, that's something I only find valuable when I'm stuck in a boring hotel room. The Pixel XL also warmed up quite a bit after my virtual reality sessions, so you should definitely keep battery life in mind. (In general, it burned through around 20 percent of battery life for every hour I played.) The competition \nIf it isn't abundantly clear by now, Daydream View is going squarely against the $100 Gear VR. I'm still a big fan of that headset, and if you're a Samsung phone owner, it's your only option. But moving forward, the mobile VR landscape is going to get more complicated. If you want the freedom to chose between different phones, rather than just Samsung's, then you're better off investing in the Daydream ecosystem. \nDaydream's big problem at the moment is its small selection of apps. There simply isn't that much available on Google Play for the platform yet. Google says that's going to change by year's end, though, with the addition of Netflix, Hulu, and the New York Times, along with plenty of other apps. This is one area where the Gear VR has a big head start, since it's been around for years and has a lot of content help from Oculus and Facebook. Still, Google is flexing its brand muscle a bit; it already has an exclusive VR experience for Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, the upcoming film set in the Harry Potter universe. Wrap-up \nWhile the Daydream View doesn't completely reinvent mobile VR, it's a solid first step for Google. It's ideal for testing the waters of virtual reality without being locked into Samsung's ecosystem. But its success depends on more Daydream phones being released, consumers being willing to pay for a headset and developers jumping on the platform.

      "text": "The first VR-ready Windows 10 phone is incredibly basic Google's Daydream has nothing to worry about. Share Save \nGoogle is leading the mobile VR race with its Daydream platform and headset , but Microsoft is getting ready to join in too. Alcatel has made a $470 Windows 10-powered version of its Idol 4S phone , and it's the first mobile device running this OS to have virtual reality capabilities. Like its Android brother, the new Idol also comes with its own headset. I played around with it to see if this first stab at VR on Windows 10 Mobile is any good. Unfortunately, it isn't. \nFirst off, the Idol 4S Windows 10 doesn't simply have a different operating system than its Android sibling, which I reviewed earlier this year . It also packs a more powerful Snapdragon processor , sharper camera, more RAM and storage, but uses weaker speakers and a lower-res full HD display. \nThat lower resolution was evident when I hunted down the walking dead in Zombie VR, where things like poles and seats in an abandoned subway car were clearly pixelated. The Android Idol didn't have super smooth graphics either, but artifacts are more obvious on the Windows version. Gallery: Alcatel Idol 4S with Windows hands on | 8 Photos 8 +4 \nThe virtual reality experience was developed in-house by Alcatel, but Microsoft collaborated with the Chinese firm on testing for quality and compatibility. Microsoft didn't seem to really play a part in implementing the VR, here. When asked what the company's plans were for supporting such mobile virtual reality platforms, a Microsoft spokesperson said it looks forward to sharing more in the future. Meanwhile, what you have is a VR content store that Alcatel created, as well as an app called Tube 360, for discovering media. \nThe VR app store here is incredibly basic. It has two categories - Games and 360-degree Media. The former contains just seven titles right now, while the latter offers two immersive pictures and one video. That's it. These are pulled from the Windows app store, and Alcatel said that it will add more content as it is created for the OS. Tube 360 is a preloaded third-party app that aggregates 360-degree content from YouTube and offers dozens more clips than the store does. Gallery: Alcatel Windows 10 Mobile VR screenshots | 7 Photos 7 +3 \nYou can launch all these games and files directly from the Windows 10 All Apps menu, or start your VR adventure with the included launcher. It's nearly identical to the one Alcatel made for the Android version, with the same seven icons floating in a horizontal row over a starry backdrop. The only difference I spotted was in the games: instead of using the on-goggles buttons to trigger actions, you'll have to hold your cursor (by tilting your head) over special items or symbols until a ring fills up. It's very Kinect-like, which will be intuitive for those who use that system, but is slower than tapping the physical keys on the headset. \nIn the game, I could only move my head around to aim my crosshair at attacking zombies. My in-game gun fired automatically whenever I lined up my target, and I had no say over when to shoot. If I could at least use the two buttons available on Alcatel's goggles, I could actually pull the trigger myself, and use the other key to reload or navigate. \nAnother problem: sounds and music in the VR apps, including the games, will only play through the phone's speakers. I tried plugging in three different types of headphones, and the audio still streamed out of the phone. This only affected VR content, media from other sources, such as YouTube or Spotify, flowed through the headphones. Alcatel said it's aware of this issue, and that it's working on an over-the-air app update as soon as possible. My Idol 4S Windows 10 was a pre-production unit, too, so here's hoping that consumer-ready versions will ship with the fix in place. \nUltimately, it feels like Microsoft could have worked better with Alcatel on this attempt to make Windows 10 Mobile VR-ready. Even though the Android version was not crafted in partnership with Google, and Alcatel will likely need to adopt Daydream's launcher at some point, it's still a better-implemented experience. For a phone that targets \"professionals, gamers and general tech enthusiasts alike,\" according to the Windows blog announcing this device , the Idol 4S with Windows needs a more cohesive virtual reality launcher and content library. It will likely get better over time with more software updates, but as it stands, the VR part of this phone is not going to win over users.

Google punishes deceptive 'repeat offender' sites More like this Use commas to separate multiple email addresses From Your message has been sent. Sorry Computerworld | Nov 10, 2016 3:50 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Comments \nGoogle is here to protect the little people, right? \nThat is why the tech giant is instituting new rules for malicious websites that have previously been able to game Google's \"Safe Browsing\" system. Now, sites that clean up their act only to reimplement malicious code or software won't have it so easy. \nIn IT Blogwatch, we cautiously visit new websites. \nSo what is happening? Gregg Keizer has the details : When Google flags sites for hosting malicious code or unwanted software...users see warnings in Chrome and other browsers...But after making changes to align...with Google's \"Safe Browsing\" terms, webmasters may ask Google to lift the virtual embargo. ... Not surprising, some took advantage of the mechanism for lifting...warnings. Sites would cease...illicit practices...only long enough to get back into Google's good graces. Once Google gave the all-clear, the once-dirty-then-clean site would...again distribute malware or spew phishing emails. \nSo what is Google doing about it? Liam Tung is in the know : The search company has introduced a new class in its Safe Browsing...system called \"repeat offenders\"...for sites that appear to intentionally spread malware, unwanted software, or phishing pages. ... Rules for repeat offenders will halt the review process that Google normally allows...Chrome will display a full page \"deceptive\" warning for those sites...repeat-offender sites will be stuck with the warning for 30 days before Google is willing to review it again. \nWe get why Google is doing this, but was there some sort of impetus? And what about site that are hacked and don't mean to spread malware? Brooke Heinichen from Google's safe browsing team fills us in : We’ve observed that a small number of websites will cease harming users for long enough to have the warnings removed, and...then revert to harmful activity. ... As a result of this gap in...protection, we have adjusted our policies to reduce risks borne by end-users...Please note that websites that are hacked will not be classified as Repeat Offenders; only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy. \nClearly, this change in policy seems like a good thing that will protect users. But is it all positive? Ian Paul isn't totally convinced : Google’s harsh stand...will undoubtedly protect many people from being unwitting victims to malicious software. But I wonder if it’s...truly fair. It’s one thing to enforce a thirty-day waiting period for sites that deserve it, but what if a second offense is explicable...a 30-day sentence to purgatory without any chance of appeal seems almost guaranteed to ensnare sites that don’t deserve it.

      "text": "Google’s Project Soli mobile radar input tech can now identify objects Posted Review: Google’s Daydream View VR headset is comfy and uncomplicated \nIf you don’t recall Google’s Project Soli , you’re forgiven – the project was unveiled at Google I/O in 2015, and while potentially very cool, we haven’t heard much about it since. Soli uses tiny radar units to detect gesture input where other forms of input, like a touchscreen, might be impractical or impossible. Google demoed the tech using a smartwatch, for instance, but it could also work for building gesture interaction into otherwise solid objects like a desk, for instance. \nSoli has a new trick up its sleeve thanks to researchers at Scotland’s University of St. Andrews (via The Verge ) – it can now identify objects, using radar to determine both the exterior shape and internal structure of whatever it’s sensing to tell you what the thing is. It’s not fool-proof, since it has difficulty determining the difference between objects made up of similar material with similar density, and it has to train the system on what an object is before it can be identified. \nResearchers are going to work on fixing any confusion around identifying similar objects, and the second problem is fixed easily enough by building a comprehensive reference database software can poll to get matching IDs for known objects. Such a resource could grow quickly with a decent volume of use – something that would happen pretty quickly if Soli were integrated into future Android smartphones or wearables, for instance. \nFrom Ara to Soli, Google has made a lot of early bets on advanced, mobile sensor technology that could make a huge difference to how we use our devices if included in future smartphones, and Soli’s expanded capabilities beyond just being a means for detecting gesture input make that clear. Our smartphones will have a deep awareness of context and surroundings in the future, make no mistake. 0",

Google’s VR platform is at last here in the form of the $79 Daydream View headset. It’s simple, (relatively) stylish and a big step forward from Google Cardboard. \nThe soft, flexible fabric-covered design of the Daydream View is a philosophical decision just as much as a design choice. Google doesn’t want VR to be “a gadget,” the company wants the headset to be an extension of your phone’s capabilities. The View feels the least alien of any VR headset I’ve tried from a design standpoint and it’s also proven to be one of the more comfortable ones. \nOne design quirk that proved to be quite annoying for me was the width of the View itself. For all the flexibility its fabric design presented, I found that it was a bit too rigid when it came to either side allowing light leakage from light sources directly behind you. Perhaps I just have an oddly-shaped cranium but this has not been a problem I’ve experienced with other VR headsets. Thanks to the fact that the face mask is removable and washable there are some quick and dirty fixes for this but it’s still a bit frustrating. \nThe headset is really just a bunch of fabric covering a more rigid body with a couple of lenses. A very notable inclusion with the View is the Daydream controller which brings a much deeper level of interaction to the system. Like the headset, it’s a 3 degree-of-freedom piece of hardware meaning that it’s place in space can’t be tracked. Instead the device operates in a strikingly similar manner to a Nintendo Wiimote. It has a clickable touchpad which gives potential for even more complex controls in addition to a couple buttons. Battery life has been great on the controller so far in that I haven’t had to recharge it after several days of heavy use, it supposedly lasts quite a while. \nAt the end of the day, the View is just a headset while Daydream is a highly critical VR ecosystem. Mobile VR was always going to be Google’s to lose in the beginning because of the ubiquity of Android. It seems this fact has not been lost on the big G, which has spent the past couple years moving conservatively as its waited for phone hardware to begin the catch-up before introducing anything past Cardboard. \nIf you’ve tried Cardboard, which Google first showed off in June 2014, it likely didn’t take you too long to realize its limitations. Other than the fact that cardboard as a building material doesn’t really lead to the most comfortable experience, the experience was jittery enough that any demo lasting longer than 10 minutes often left one with a wicked headache. The reason for this was the head-tracking latency which ensured that the phone display didn’t quite keep up with head movements. \nIn Android Nougat, Google has employed some software wizardry that brings Daydream-ready phones head-tracking latency below 20ms which is about as good as it needs to be to keep VR comfortable for longer stretches of time. My longest sessions ended because of the phone overheating, not from any sort of queasiness. \nA big part of the Daydream system is its emphasis on being frictionless. Unlock your phone and drop it in the headset. You’re done. Navigate to an app that looks cool and click download. You’re good. Everything is always just a couple of steps or button clicks away and that design ethos of quick access is baked into this system and the hardware it couples with. \nWhen it comes to comparing the Daydream View against other products, high-end VR headsets like the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PS VR are not the systems to be stacking up against. The more fair comparison is against the host of other slot-in mobile VR headsets, including most popularly the Samsung Gear VR. \nWith Daydream in view, the limitations of Oculus and their current mobile strategy come into full view. The Gear VR, which is made by Oculus in partnership with Samsung, has sold over a million headsets but there was a self-imposed limit to its success based on the fact that you needed a Samsung Galaxy or Note phone to use it. Now this wasn’t an imminent problem until that whole Note 7 debacle took place and Oculus realized the dangers of carrying all one’s eggs in a single basket. Moving forward it’s unclear what Oculus’s mobile strategy is or what it can become. Samsung will likely soon start Daydream-certifying its newer phones and as more and more phone manufacturers adopt OLED screens and other mobile VR ingredients, the advantages are sure to stack up for Daydream. daydream-view-1",

      "text": "Google’s Daydream View made me a believer again in consumer VR Posted Advertisement Google’s new Daydream View VR headset is available starting today, and the fabric-encased, lightweight plastic Cardboard successor is a big step up, not only from Google’s first modest attempts at creating a VR headset, but also for mobile virtual reality in general. Humble beginnings \nWhen Google debuted Cardboard at its 2014 Developers Conference, then- Google Product Chief Sundar Pichai showed off the headset made of modest materials with an insouciance that indirectly poked fun at the ambitious and expensive Oculus purchase Facebook had announced only shortly before. Google’s VR headset was made of about $10 worth of materials, and while many dismissed it as a toy compared to other VR hardware, it ended up providing a lot of guidance for Daydream, which is easily the new leader in casual, mobile VR. \nThe basic premise for Daydream View is the same: All you have to do is slide your phone in and go. Google’s bottom-up approach to VR was seen as far too casual by many, but I predicted at the time that the company’s low-end look at VR would be the only truly competitive alternative to high-end offerings like the Rift. Middle ground for virtual reality is hard to find, because trade-offs for costs in the mid-range can’t make up for the huge drop-offs in overall experience. Cardboard succeeded precisely because it wasn’t really promising anything, and it basically didn’t cost anything, either. Setting expectations \nDaydream View’s price tag might boost experience expectations somewhat, but it’s still only $79 in the U.S., which is $20 less than its nearest competitor, the Samsung Gear VR. And while the higher price tag might mean people expect more, Daydream View will over deliver on the expectations of most. \nDaydream View is still VR’s most low-friction access point; it’s actually easier to use than Cardboard, because of the built-in head strap and bundled Bluetooth controller. But the quality of its VR experience is at least on par with Gear VR – and based on the time I’ve spent with it so far, it’s better, thanks to a more sensible VR hub and navigation elements that build on user familiarity with Android and the Play Store. \nGetting it working with your phone, at least with the Pixel XL review unit provided with the Daydream View by Google, is also far easier than starting out with Gear VR, mainly because their are no cables or physical connections to make. You fold down the View’s front flap, place the Daydream-compatible phone in the headset and close it back up. You don’t even need to be careful about aligning the screen image – it detects its position and auto-aligns for a clear view through the headsets lenses. \nIt’s a lower barrier to entry than the easiest home VR experience, which is PlayStation VR, and the bundled controller works very well for making sure there’s no confusion about how to navigate once you’re immersed. Gear VR’s gamepad support is appreciated, but out of the box, you awkwardly navigate using a touch panel on the side of the headset, which has never felt like a natural interaction mode. The right introductory content \nThe library of Daydream content is a little thin in terms of titles available at launch, especially compared to the decent size of Gear VR’s available options. But Google appears to have selected for quality in terms of both first- and third-party software offerings, and the terrific native support for YouTube 360-degree videos means there’s no shortage of casual content to consume. The list of apps with upcoming Daydream support also offers a lot to look forward to in terms of things that could bring in users who aren’t sure about VR but want to get into it via familiar experiences – Netflix and HBO Go should really help, for instance. \nGoogle made a big deal about the design of Daydream View, from tis fabric exterior to its single strap design and light weight, and while it’s still definitely going to draw stares when you’re using it on an airplane or the bus, for instance, what they’ve done in terms of making it appear more generally palatable shouldn’t be underestimated. VR for the masses \nIn the end, Daydream View feels like a next step, not the culminating arrival point for consumer VR. But it progresses the field in a number of very important ways – ways that mean Daydream VR is likely to be the first VR experience for significant number of mobile users, who luckily won’t be disappointed by what they find. \nEarly VR hype gave way to realities that indicated its niche status wasn’t going anywhere anytime soon – Rift and Vive are too specialized, too expensive and too power-hungry to work with anything resembling a general audience. Latecomers have done more to convince me there’s real potential in the consumer VR market; PSVR is a seriously piece of kit for anyone who enjoys gaming, and Daydream View has the potential to impress everyday mobile users in a way nothing else out there today can hope to achieve. 0",

      "text": "The highlight of Google's Daydream VR is ... its controller November 10, 2016 by Anick Jesdanun \nThe best thing about Google's new virtual-reality headset isn't the headset at all. \nIn fact, Daydream View would pale compared with Samsung's Gear VR headset were it not for Daydream's controller, a handheld device that responds to gestures and other motion. \nWith Gear VR, I have to move my head to point a cursor at something, then reach for a button on the headset. With Daydream, I can just aim and click the controller in my hand. Sensors in the device tell the headset what I'm trying to do, whether it's swinging a tennis racket or casting a fishing rod. The headset's display responds accordingly. \nThe headset and controller are sold together for $79, starting Thursday. No rush in getting one, though, as the virtual experiences built for Daydream are still limited. And for now, it works only with Google's Pixel phone . \n___ \nTHE MANY FLAVORS OF VIRTUAL REALITY \nWhile sophisticated systems like Facebook's Oculus Rift and HTC's Vive let you walk around in the virtual world, Daydream View is a sit-down experience in which you use the controller to move yourself around. (You could walk around with the Daydream on if you wanted to, but you won't go anywhere in virtual space—and you might run into the wall.) \nBut the Rift and the Vive each costs more than $1,500, once you include powerful personal computers they require. Suddenly, $79 sounds like a bargain. Daydream stays cheap by using the display and processing power of your phone, which you insert into the headset at eye level. \nGear VR, at $100, takes a similar approach, but it works only with Samsung phones. While Daydream works only with Pixel for now, several other Android makers plan to make compatible phones. Sorry, iPhone users. \nThose without compatible phones still have Google Cardboard, a $15 contraption you hold up to your face. Using Daydream View, by contrast, is more like wearing goggles. While Gear VR has a better fit, with focusing and a second strap over your head to keep the headset from sliding too low, Daydream is much more comfortable to wear and use than Cardboard. \n___ \nALL ABOUT THAT CONTROLLER \nThose who've played Nintendo's Wii system will find the Daydream controller familiar. It's about the size and shape of a chocolate bar, and it has motion sensors to track movement. \nAlthough I'm not a big gamer, I enjoyed shooting water out of a hose to put out fires. You simply hold a button to spray and move the controller around to douse flames. You can even tilt the controller to control the angle of the hose. Another app lets you explore the universe by using the controller as a laser pointer to bring up more information. \nThe controller makes it easier to navigate menus without making yourself dizzy; just move it around to point at things. And while getting the full 360-degree experience of VR often requires spinning around (a swivel chair helps), some apps in Daydream let you grab the scene with your controller and drag it around you, just as you would with a PC mouse. \nIt's also handy to have volume controls and a home button in your hand rather than on your head. \n___ \nNAUSEA FREE? \nVR can be nauseating, and Daydream is no different. I found that it's less about the headset, and more about the VR video. \nThe best videos use stationary cameras and let you move your head (or controller ) around to explore. The nauseating ones tend to treat VR cameras like regular movie cameras , with a lot of panning in response to a subject's movements. The viewer, not the subject, should be the one doing the moving. \nAnd while I enjoyed watching a woman's skydive in VR on YouTube, scenes of her preparing to jump felt jarring because the camera was on her shaky arm. I had to remove my headset . \n___ \nWHAT'S THERE TO DO? \nYou can view 360-degree YouTube videos and any 360-degree photos you store on Google Photos. You can visit other destinations such as the Galapagos Islands in a 360-degree version of Google's Street View. A few games, museum artworks and The Wall Street Journal's app were also available to try out prior to Thursday's launch. \nA handful more are coming Thursday. Even more are promised by the end of the year, including apps for Netflix and Hulu—though all that does is offer video on a giant screen in a virtual living room. \nThere's much more available for Cardboard. Unfortunately, app developers will need to make some tweaks first to make them compatible with Daydream. They'll need to do even more to take advantage of the motion control. \nDaydream has promise, but until more apps arrive, its potential is still a dream.",

      "text": "share Photo by Mark Wilson/Getty Images The tech industry is still reeling from Donald Trump’s election to the White House earlier this week, with new statements from Apple , Microsoft , and Facebook already seeking to make sense of the president-elect. But as those conversations have played out, a lesser-known CEO was suggesting a more unorthodox response for tech companies in the Trump era: stop collecting so much data. The comments came from Pinboard CEO Maciej Ceglowski, a longtime critic of data collection on the web. According to Ceglowski, the only sane response to a Trump presidency was to get rid of as much stored user data as possible. “If you work at Google or Facebook,” he wrote on Pinboard’s Twitter account , “please start a meaningful internal conversation about giving people tools to scrub their behavioral data.” Both companies declined to comment. When Joe Arpaio is head of the FBI, the process for obtaining data from private industry will be streamlined, let’s put it that way — Pinboard (@Pinboard) November 9, 2016 The sentiment was echoed by sociologist Zeynep Tufekci, who wrote that “tech companies should immediately go to end-to-end encryption and ponder alternative financial models.” For both critics, the concern is surveillance. Once Trump is legally in charge of the nation’s intelligence agencies, all that data will be subject to FISA orders and extra-legal hacking campaigns. And given his alarming comments on muslims , refugees , and members of the press , there’s no telling who might be subject to such a campaign. “If the FBI wanted to round up every muslim in America for detailed questioning, that didn’t seem like a likely scenario, but now it seems much more likely,” Ceglowski said in a call with The Verge . “It’s viscerally brought home why this matters.” Even Ceglowski recognizes that company practices can’t change overnight. Targeted advertising is the core business for both Google and Facebook, and that business makes them billions of dollars a year. Targeting those ads takes specific data on specific users — but Ceglowski is betting it doesn’t take quite as much data as is currently being collected. “I’m calling for them to shorten the horizon over which they retain the data,” he says, “and be especially careful not to collect extra data they don’t need.” Those companies’ data has been used for surveillance before -- most notably through the NSA’s PRISM program , which showed the agency accessing internal servers at Google, Microsoft and Facebook. Earlier this year, Facebook drew fire for providing API access to Geofeedia, a company employing social media data to target protestors . (Facebook was later revealed to be a client of the company as well as a supplier of data.) Police have also used Android’s location data to place suspects at the scene of a crime. Crucially, data requests can only succeed if the company retains the relevant data, which has driven many users to end-to-end encrypted services like WhatsApp or Signal that are mathematically prevented from intercepting and storing user messages. Google users can also manually delete their data through the service’s My Activity portal , which will scrub it from Google’s servers within days. Outside of intelligence services, police typically obtain company data with a court-ordered warrant, and most companies freely admit to filling lawful requests for data in that form. It also gives users some security: Trump or no, a judge has to sign off on probable cause before the warrant can be issued. As the prospect of another encryption battle looms, the warrant process may be the one part of the system that both sides can agree on. But for Ceglowski, the presumption of the rule of law simply may not apply under Trump. “I don’t think the US is going to turn into a lawless state overnight, but look at the dynamic in places like Russia,” he said. “He’s not going to care enough to prevent such abuses at a lower level and certainly he’s going to protect anyone who’s taken to task for them.” “I hate to sound fear-mongering but I’m from Poland,” he continued. “This fits a pattern that I recognize. It’s just that it hasn’t happened before in the United States.” More From The Verge",

      "title": "YouTube VR is Daydream's killer app",
      "text": "YouTube VR is Daydream's killer app The video service offers a foundation that Google's virtual reality division can build off of share There is a thick fog drifting through the woods, obscuring everything more than few feet in front of my face. I can see a crooked sapling, and then behind me I hear the crunching of dry leaves. Turning, I spot several figures lurching slowly forward. As they come closer, details emerge: a stain of dark blood on one’s clothing, a piece of missing flesh on the arm of another. I can hear the ravenous murmuring grow louder, as the zombies close in from all sides. This wild experience was delivered to me as a 360-degree film, posted on YouTube recently by AMC as part of its promotion for The Walking Dead. It felt especially terrifying to me because I was streaming on YouTube’s new VR app, which launches to the public today. I watched it on a Daydream View virtual reality headset powered by a Pixel smartphone. From the hardware to software, everything about this experience was crafted by Google, and it was terrific. I felt \"present\" in a horror film, a character sharing the same world with flesh-eating ghouls, not just watching it unfold as a spectator with a screen. I got to spend a week reviewing YouTube’s VR and I found a lot to love. It’s a big step up from the VR experience Google has been able to deliver so far with its Cardboard headsets. The hardware means immersive films look better and head tracking is more accurate. More importantly, the software interface for casual browsing is terrific. Hopping from one video to another no longer feels like a chore, and you can keep an eye on what’s playing in the background while cueing up your next bite of entertainment. While a lot of the immersive videos being created for YouTube VR are still in the experimental phase, the app itself feels polished and intuitive. It starts with a sense of place. A lot of the time, when you use a VR app, the home screen is a fully fleshed-out location meant to add atmosphere. The Wall Street Journal app in Daydream, for example, puts you into a luxury apartment, complete with fine art, gleaming modern furniture, and sumptuous views of midtown Manhattan. The Google Play app does a similar thing, putting you in a living room stocked with posters, statues, and memorabilia that serve as playful reminders of iconic characters from film and television. YouTube gives Daydream a bedrock to build on \nYouTube’s app does away with all that. \"The key was to make it feel like a real physical environment without drawing your attention away from the content,\" said John Harding, who leads engineering for emerging experiences on YouTube. \"It’s a very muted environment, it’s very subtle.\" You are standing inside an empty geodesic dome. Ahead of you a screen floats above an empty gray floor. YouTube’s familiar interface hangs suspended in the air around the screen. You can dismiss it once you start to watch, or bring it up again with a click, leaving your video to play behind semi-transparent icons and menus. On top of this minimalist world, YouTube basically overlays its familiar interface. It’s like a floating wall of semi-translucent controls, and it works really well. The Daydream controller makes clicking and scrolling a snap. It's a struggle to type when you want to search, but luckily voice search is available. I spent time inside all the Google apps that come preinstalled inside Daydream, and it’s clear YouTube’s VR product has gotten a lot more attention than Google Street View or Google Play — both of which feel far less polished, and don’t take advantage of the new Daydream controller nearly as well. My colleague Adi Robertson feels Daydream is still waiting for its killer app . For me, YouTube VR is the most satisfying part of a major web property to virtual reality that I’ve ever used, an app I felt like coming back to every day, and one that definitely gives Daydream a bedrock to build on. Along with crafting a location and adding environmental effects, YouTube had to decide on the dimensions of the experience. \"Getting the depth cues right was also critical,\" said Harding. \"How big does the screen feel? Am I sitting three feet away from a five-foot TV or am I in the middle of a movie theater with a huge screen? The actual field of view occupied is the same, but you get a very different sense of presence and level of comfort.\" Right now the app presents you with a screen much bigger than a household TV floating about 10 feet in front of you. The effect, when you dismiss the floating controls, is powerful. I watched a UFC fight, and while it wasn’t an immersive 360 experience, I definitely felt myself sink more deeply into the action, with my headset blocking out the world around me, and nothing but the moving image to occupy my attention. YouTube has added some subtle touches to reinforce the feeling of presence in a physical space. While the screen is magically floating above the ground, it casts a flickering light onto the floor, shifting in color and strength to match the picture. \nYouTube is now a physical place with environmental effects The default view isn’t perfect. With my Pixel XL I found that about two-thirds of the screen was in focus and the rest was a bit blurred. Luckily YouTube has a nice fix for this: using the controller you can zoom the screen in and out. Make it smaller and you can keep the entire image in sharp focus at once. Zoom way in and you can have it fill your screen. This is a nice way to add an immersive quality to films that aren’t shot in 360. Videos shot from the perspective of a drone moving at high speed, for example, feel amazing when stretched to cover every corner of your view. Another clever touch YouTube has included is the ability to grab your screen and reposition it. Just click and drag to your desired location. Like a lot of VR headsets, the Daydream View can get heavy on your head after a while, and I found mine tended to slip down if I didn’t hold it with one hand or reposition every few minutes. I could minimize the issue by reclining or by lying flat on my back, and to center the image I would just grab the screen and move it into the perfect position. There was one major issue I had with the app. Since this was YouTube, the video was streaming. When my connection was strong enough, everything looked great. But when my connection occasionally faltered, especially when streaming a 360-degree video, YouTube downgraded the quality of the image, and the immersive world around me suddenly became a blurry, pixelated mess. To avoid this, I tweaked my settings, insisting the video stream in high quality instead of adapting on the fly. Unfortunately this meant the video would often pause, a white pinwheel circling in space as my video struggled to load. \nAds are a million times worse in VR \nThe big drawbacks to YouTube in VR are predicated on the very things that made YouTube a massive success: streaming and advertising. These are the twin pillars that helped the service grow into the global giant it is today. They are also absolutely miserable in virtual reality. When your eyes are inches from the screen, and you can’t look away, ads, adaptive bitrates, and buffering feel way more intrusive and grating. \nKeeping streaming and advertising in the mix creates problems, but there is actually a simple solution to these issues, one that fits nicely into the company’s business model. If you’re a YouTube Red subscriber, you don’t have to sit through ads and you can download videos to watch offline, allowing you to sidestep the two biggest issues I had with the VR experience. So far YouTube hasn’t found a huge audience for its subscription offering, but Google is giving away three months of Red free with the purchase of a Pixel, so perhaps the added value it brings to the VR experience will convince a new cohort to join. The software is one side of the YouTube VR experience, content is the other.There is a lot of 360 video on YouTube, and plenty of high-definition stuff that's worth watching in two dimensions. But I would be lying if I said most YouTube videos make sense in this new medium. I’ve got a mix of comedy, music, gaming, and martial arts videos churning through my daily feed, and the vast majority of those are not worth isolating myself in a headset. Most clips were still best while I’m washing the dishes, walking the dog, or riding on the subway, not blocking out the rest of the world so I can focus entirely on them. \nYouTube is throwing big money behind 360 creation \nYouTube isn’t oblivious to the fact that a lot of its popular content — makeup tutorials, unboxing gadgets, silly pranks, and webcam confessionals — aren’t particularly powerful when ported to virtual reality. At the same time, the company believes it has to leverage its current roster of creators if it hopes to make YouTube VR an app that users will return to on a daily basis. So it’s giving any creator with over 10,000 subscribers access to cameras and software for making 360 videos through its Creator Spaces. And it's paying for professional production studios to join some of its top talent to craft new videos that pay homage to the subject matter certain channels are known for while tweaking the formula so it’s worth watching in VR. \nThe success or failure of these efforts will have a big impact on Google’s push into virtual reality. YouTube VR is one of just a handful of apps you can use on the Daydream platform right now. There is a lot more to choose from inside an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive, and even on Samsung’s Galaxy Gear, a comparable piece of casual VR hardware powered by software from Facebook’s Oculus. For Daydream to succeed, and by extension Google’s efforts in VR, the ecosystem has to be something users will want to come back to on a regular basis. Until third-party developers start building lots of experiences, YouTube’s creators are going to have to pick up the slack. Take Merideth Foster, a YouTuber best known for videos on fashion and beauty. A 360-degree shot of her applying foundation and blush is probably a waste of everyone’s time. So YouTube partnered her with Surreal to craft a virtual tour of her apartment instead. Fousey Tube, a channel built around pranks and challenges, used skydiving to justify a 360-degree video. Some creators kept their tried-and-true formula while adding a few bells and whistles for VR. Tastemade, a cooking channel, simply stuck a 360 camera into the kitchen, so viewers can feel like they are standing right alongside the hosts. They also experimented with animated overlays that pop up during the action. Instead of a two-dimensional video that cuts from a shot of the cook to a close-up of the food prep, the VR version drops a visual of eggs being whisked right in front of the chef. It’s funny and wonderful and weird and doesn’t always work well. It’s mixed-reality editing, a new approach for a new medium. \"As I’ve watched VR for the last year and a half, I’ve started to see a lot of similarities to the early days of web video,\" says Jamie Byrne, a 10-year veteran of YouTube who started working at the company before it was acquired by Google. \"If you had told anyone back then that videos of people putting on, making, or taking gadgets out of box would be worth billions, they would have said you were crazy. But of course that’s the reality today.\" \n\"We’re still kind of in year zero with VR.\" Byrne is now the creative director for YouTube VR, tasked with helping creators get the tools, technology, and support they need to make videos for this new medium. \"We’re still kind of in year zero with VR or maybe you could call it year one,\" he told me. \"When we start to think about content experiences, I don’t think anyone knows what’s gonna work and what’s not gonna work. I think what’s gonna drive incredible amounts of watch time, what’s gonna create daily viewership in VR, I don’t think people know the answers to those questions.\" I came away from these videos thinking they might appeal to fans of certain YouTuber’s as an occasional treat. I wasn’t sold on the idea that 360 video was strong enough to be worth the regular investment of time and money for channels that are more about casual intimacy than immersive spectacle. But I expect things to change rapidly as YouTube and its creators get a sense of what clicks with the slowly growing audience of VR headset owners. Right now YouTube VR is simply leveraging its existing library of content and helping its popular creators figure out how to adapt the genres that already work for them to the medium of immersive videos. But it’s clear that the team hopes YouTube will eventually be more than just linear film users can watch. \"We’ve gone from rectangular video to 360 to 360 stereoscopic with positional audio. We’re looking at how do we continue to push the format forward,\" says Harding. \"We want to push the boundaries of what it means to have immersive content. Whether that means six degrees of freedom, being able to move around, or being able to interact with things, it’s definitely a direction that we’re exploring.\"",

      "title": "A week with Google’s Daydream, why Facebook should be nervous",
      "text": "A week with Google’s Daydream, why Facebook should be nervous Daydream is the platform, View is the headset, we explain it all share \nDaydream, Google’s new VR platform , isn’t a product in the way we think of the Oculus Rift and HTC Vive, or even the Gear VR. It’s a set of standards for both phones and headsets that are designed to deliver a comfortable, inviting and mobile virtual reality experience. The View is just the first headset to launch for the platform, and for now the only phone that is Daydream-ready is Google’s Pixel. Which is a pretty great phone , if you’re in the market. The Daydream View in action Jeff Ramos/Polygon There will be other Daydream-ready phones, although no specific models have been announced yet. There will be other headsets from other companies that conform to the Daydream spec but may look different or target different markets. But today we’re going to talk about the View, Google’s first-party attempt to define what a Daydream headset can be, and the Daydream platform. It’s a bit of a strange product when compared to other virtual reality headsets, but Google’s dedication to virtual reality is impressive. Cardboard is already the most widely-used virtual reality platform in the world, and this is the next step up from those inexpensive, and in some ways unimpressive, entry-level viewers. This isn’t a scored review because Daydream is likely to be a variety of devices very soon, and we didn’t have access to a large variety of software before launch. But we’re going to dig deep into the system, share some thoughts and try to explain Google’s next big step into higher-end VR. So ... how is it? And what is it? The phone is doing all the work \"There are a few key things,\" Relja Markovic, the engineering director of VR at Google, told Polygon. \"The viewer doesn’t have any active electronics in it, so when you put the phone in the viewer the phone basically detects the viewer using [near field communication]. So that’s the core signal that says ‘oh, OK, I should be thinking about going into VR now.\" The View also includes two capacitive nubs on the inside of the headset, and the Pixel senses where those touch the screen and figures out how the phone is resting in the viewer in order to align the image correctly. There is nothing to fiddle with or connect directly; you just put the phone in, the VR mode kicks in, and the image is perfect every time. My only problem with this system is that sometimes the headset didn’t seem to recognize the phone, so I had to remove it and put it back in. This happened rarely enough to not be a huge bother, but often enough that it’s worth noting. I also had to manually close the VR application on the phone after removing it from the View, it never seemed to know when to go back to standard phone mode. A Pixel phone going into the View Google This is a very different approach than the Gear VR, which includes its own electronics to decrease the latency of the Samsung phones that powered it, while also offering a touch pad for built-in controls. The issue of latency is what makes Cardboard viewers so hard on the stomach at times; the view lags too far behind your movements due to the viewers’ dependency of the hardware in the phone that powers it. The View is a cloth and plastic shell with a set of lenses and a wireless controller, and that’s it. The Pixel is doing all the heavy lifting to make virtual reality possible. \"The Pixel is just the first of many Daydream-ready phones,\" Markovic explained. \"We actually have certification requirements for things like the display to make sure it’s capable of certain low-persistence output modes. The [inertial measurement unit] isn’t just any old IMU, but actually meets very specific tolerances for precision and refresh rate.\" My god it's fast The only phone, at the moment, that’s Daydream-ready. The Google Pixel. | Jeff Ramos/Polygon Daydream-ready phones also have to meet or exceed certain minimums in terms of graphical performance in order to perform well under the strain of VR applications. So the View’s job is to tell the Pixel to go into VR mode, and then hold it comfortably near your face. There are no electronics or sensors involved in the headset itself, which will make it easier for other companies to release their own take on what a Daydream headset could be. At Daydream’s launch, however, Google’s View is the first and only option. Let’s dig in. The View Google likes to describe the View as being inspired by things that you wear, and it absolutely looks like a pair of sweatpants for your face. It’s covered completely in cloth, with a squishy, removable and hand-washable mask that presses against your face. There are no cables or anything needed to connect, you just remove the controller, drop the phone in and go. Google sent us a Pixel XL to use with the device, and it looks a bit silly when connected, as if it doesn’t quite fit. But the auto alignment system works well, and you always get a good view of what’s going, even if the phone is slightly askew. The front plate actually slides away from the rest of the headset using some clever extenders on the bottom, so it will be able to fit a wide variety of phones, or even a Pixel that’s using a thin to moderate case. It’s a nice touch. The Daydream View | Jeff Ramos/Polygon It’s also comfortable as hell. The squishy front mask plays nice with your glasses, to the point where I never even noticed I was wearing vision correction while in VR — a nice change from headsets like the Rift that often force you to fumble with your glasses when you put on or remove the headset — and the pressure is distributed evenly around the face once you fiddle with it a bit to get it seated corrected. And that moment of fiddling is important; the View, like most VR headsets, has a \"sweet spot\" that allows you to see the image with maximum clarity. It can take a moment to find that sweet spot — my advice would be to look at text while doing so to help notice the difference — but it should only take you a moment to put it on once you get used to the process. The design is kind of goofy-looking at first, but it’s also oddly friendly. It’s a piece of technology that invites touching and squeezing; it’s approachable in way many virtual reality headsets aren’t. This is meant to be something you hold and feel, and people I’ve handed it to seem to love playing with it even before putting it on. Even the clasp on top is a stretchy loop with a small bit of fabric to grab onto and hook around body of the headset to close it. The View’s face mask is squishy, and comfortable Jeff Ramos/Polygon I’ve noticed many people are scared to break a VR headset when they hold one for the first time, but I have yet to see anyone treat the View with the same gingerness. My wife remarked that it looked like it was covered with Oprah’s T-shirt sheets , which is apparently a thing. The View seemed like an object of curiosity when I showed it to people; everyone wanted to hold it and feel the cloth and play with the top clasp. Google did a great job creating VR hardware that seems playful, and anecdotally people are responding to its unorthodox looks. The View’s faceplate also both hides and holds the system’s controller, which is a nice detail that makes the controller harder to lose. That’s a good thing, because that controller is another way the Daydream View stands out. The controller The controller that comes with the View isn’t just the View controller, it’s the Daydream controller. Developers don’t have the option of using a standard Bluetooth controller for their game, nor does the headset itself include a touchpad or any other means of interaction outside of looking around. The controller is it. The controller slips into the mask for storage | Google In practice it operates like the bastard child of a remote control and a laser pointer. The bottom button will take you back to the home screen with a tap, or re-center the View and the controller in the direction you’re facing if you hold it down. The middle button’s use is left up to the developer, and the top, indented dish is both a touchpad and a button. There are also volume controls on the side, which is a nice touch. It’s also motion-tracked, and you see a virtual representation of the controller in the home menu and many of the games, allowing you to point at things you’d like to interact with, wave a magic wand or aim a gun. The controller is comfortable to hold, and easy to understand | Jeff Ramos/Polygon You can see one use of it in the user interface for the Google Street View app. The downside to the controller is that it only offers three degrees of freedom, instead of the six you get with the HTC Vive controller. That means you can point the controller in any direction, or even twist it so it’s facing downward, and the tracking is solid. What it can’t do is move in and out of the game world; it’s not actually a tracked object in 3D space. So in the top right image below, imagine the controller is locked in place, but you can point it in any direction or flip it over to see its back. You can also switch it to left-handed mode in the options. Searching in Street View | Google Thumb movement on the pad | Google The View controller, showing the volume buttons | Jeff Ramos/Polygon And Google has found some interesting ways to make that controller feel natural. The controller doesn’t actually stay in one place as you move it around the home menu, it slides around as if it were on the surface of a sphere in order to model your elbow. It fakes you into feeling like the controller has more sensors than it actually does, and it’s an effective illusion. \"We can give you a really strong sense of a connection with your hand,\" Markovic told Polygon. Google also provides developers with best practices for the controller, and helps show them the best ways to model hand movement in their games. \"We have a suite of kinda mathematical libraries that lets developers translate ... you give us the context of your app, the controller gives us its state, and then our library adapts one to the other,\" Markovic explained. The controller fits snugly in the View when not in use Jeff Ramos/Polygon And again, this is the controller for Daydream. Other companies can create and offer their versions of it, but the basic ability and number of buttons will always remain the same. And developers are already finding neat ways to use it; the kart-racing game on Daydream has you hold the control horizontally and turn it to steer, while using the button on the left-hand side for throttle. The controller also suffers from a moderate amount of drift, and I found myself holding the home button every five minutes or so to re-center the pointer. This will happen often enough that it’s addressed in the system’s first tutorial introducing you to Daydream. You’ll want to re-center things if you move the position of your arm or hand as well, as the controller works best for most apps and games when you hold your shoulder still and move either your elbow or your wrist. It’s a bit hard to get used, but it does allow for some impressively expressive motions in games that use it well. So how is it? The Daydream View is exactly what you want it to be: A higher-end version of the Cardboard platform with a motion controller, lower latency and all the advantages of being created by Google. I was told they were able to achieve a bit better than 20ms of motion-to-photon latency , which is a technical way of saying it won’t make you sick as you look around the world. The headset is comfortable, even during long sessions, and the controller allows for some interesting interactions while inside games and applications. There’s a nifty welcome application that explains the various aspects of the hardware, and you can revisit the brief tutorial if you want to introduce anyone else to the View. The YouTube app is pretty slick in virtual reality Google And Google gets to flex its software muscles with the launch applications. The Street View app allows you to explore famous places and even warp around them a bit, and the YouTube VR app is one of the best video applications I’ve ever used in virtual reality. You can watch 360 degree video, which can be blocky messes if you’re not on a fast connection, but standard videos work just as well; you can click and drag the virtual screen anywhere you’d like, while making it bigger or smaller by sliding your thumb up or down on the touchpad. If you have YouTube Red you can also download 360 degree videos and watch them locally as well. There’s a Google Photos application that can sync to your existing Google Photos account so you can look at your holiday snaps in virtual reality, or you can download the Cardboard Camera application and create your own virtual reality panoramas, complete with a sound clip, to view in your virtual gallery. Google Play Store App | Google Google Daydream Home | Google Google Photos | Google Google Play Movies | Google You buy new Daydream apps through the Google Play store, which takes you to its VR section when used in the View, and there’s a Google Play Movies application that lets you watch movies or trailers in a virtual reality theater. If you already own TV shows or Movies you bought through Google play, you can watch them in virtual reality. Many of your Google accounts and services link into the Daydream ecosystem. I asked about the ability to play local videos or videos I shot using the phone in a virtual theater, and I was told that one workaround is to upload the videos to YouTube in a private account and then download them using YouTube Red to watch them locally. It’s an overly complex solution to a simple problem, but Google also stressed to me that Daydream is an open platform, and we’ll likely see theater apps for local video pop up on the story relatively quickly. We were able to try a few games in the review bundle of applications that Google sent us, including a VR version of Mekorama , a collection of carnival-based minigames called Wonderglade , and a hack-and-slash type deal called Hunter’s Gate . More content should be available at launch, which means right now, but we were only given access to a select few games and applications for review purposes. It’s kind of neat to see a 3D representation of the stock market in the Wall Street Journal application, but it’s nothing I can see myself using with any regularity. These are the early days of the platform, however, and many more applications and games are on the way, including support for Hulu, HBO Now, Netflix and others. In conclusion The Gear VR has a serious competitor for best mobile VR platform, and if you’re planning on picking up a Pixel or more Daydream-ready phones are announced soon, the $79.99 peripheral is kind of a no-brainer. Google’s tendrils extending in so many directions gives them a strategic advantage that Oculus, even with Facebook’s support, will likely find hard to counter. You’ll also notice that your phone will heat up to a slightly alarming temperature if you play long session in VR, and Daydream was designed for long, intense gaming and viewing session. I have yet to see an overheating warning, but the phone will get pretty toasty. There are also no options to adjust interpupillary distance or focus the image, but I had no problems seeing clearly even without being able to fine-tune the optics. I’ll be curious to see if anyone else has problems. The View with The Pixel | Jeff Ramos/Polygon Daydream is the platform, View is Google’s own Daydream headset, and Pixel is the only Daydream-ready phone available for the moment. But it’s going to be fascinating to see how the platform evolves and changes as more phones are released and more companies create Daydream headsets. It’s going to be hard to beat the View, however, as Google created something that’s approachable, easy to use and comfortable. I’m looking forward to the release of a few more apps and games, but it’s easy to recommend the View as a must-have add-on for their Pixel.",

AP\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet unit Google's Android mobile operating system expands competition rather than hurt it, its general counsel said on Thursday as the company rebutted EU antitrust charges that it uses the platform to stifle rivals.\nThe European Commission has also ignored the role played by iPhone maker Apple when it laid out the charge in April, Google general counsel Kent Walker wrote on a blog .\n\"Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,\" Walker wrote in a statement. \"Android is the most flexible mobile platform out there, balancing the needs of thousands of manufacturers and operators, millions of app developers and more than a billion consumers. Upsetting this balance would raise prices and hamper innovation, choice and competition. That wouldn’t just be a bad outcome for us. It would be a bad outcome for the entire ecosystem, and — most critically — for consumers.\"\nThe Commission formally filed antitrust charges against Google over its Android mobile operating system last April , alleging that Google abuses its dominant position in the marketplace to push its own products and apps over those of its competitors.\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Robert-Jan Bartunek)\nRead the original article on Reuters .

      "text": "YouTube's new VR app lands on Google Daydream first The app is optimized for virtual reality, but you'll need Daydream gear to use it right now. Share Save \nWe've known about Google's plan for a dedicated YouTube VR app since Daydream was first announced back in May. Today, the version of the video hub arrives that's optimized for virtual reality. There's a catch: It's only available on Google's Daydream platform right now. This means that you'll need a compatible phone, like the Pixel and the Daydream View headset and controller to start watching. \nYouTube has supported VR videos for over a year, but now there's an app to provide a more immersive viewing experience. The new software makes every video from the site viewable in a virtual reality setting. Of course, 360-degree footage and content that's designed for VR will offer a more believable feel of \"going inside,\" but regular videos can be viewed in a new theater mode. Voice search is there to help you find exactly what you're after and you'll be able to sign in so any channels you subscribe to and your playlists are easily accessible. \nDaydream View launches today , so the new YouTube VR app will be ready for action when your headset arrives. There's also an NFL VR series that debuts Thanksgiving day on YouTube, so you'll be able to watch that as well.",

      "text": "Baby iguana fleeing killer snakes makes best chase video ever Google puts repeatedly dangerous websites on notice Web giant tries to fill the protection gap created when malicious sites clean up their act just long enough to ditch the Safe Browsing warning. PC Format Magazine @stevenmusil \nGoogle has added a new classification to its Safe Browsing initiative to better protect users from malicious websites trying to game the system. \nGoogle's Safe Browsing warns users when they are about to visit a website known to violate the Web giant's policies on malware, unwanted software, phishing or social engineering. The warning appears until Google verifies that the site in question no longer poses a threat to users. But some sites are only cleaning up their act just long enough to shake the warning, and then returning to their harmful behavior. \nThat gap in user protection led Google to create a new label to warn users of sites that engage in this pattern. \n\"Starting today, Safe Browsing will begin to classify these types of sites as \" Repeat Offenders ,\" Google explained in a company blog post Tuesday. \"Please note that websites that are hacked will not be classified as Repeat Offenders; only sites that purposefully post harmful content will be subject to the policy.\" \nOnce classified as a \"repeat offender,\" sites will not be allowed to request a review for 30 days. During that time, users will continue to see messages warning them of the risk involved in visiting the site. ",

      "text": "\nNearly all of Google's new products are now shipping, but none of them feel complete.\nWhat a month, right?! In the last 30 days Google has announced and shipped a solid answer to Apple's iPhone , competition for Amazon Echo , and a serious message that Samsung's Gear VR isn't the only game in town for great portable VR. As an Android nerd, a connected home nerd, and possibly the biggest VR nerd on the planet (by weight) I should be in some kind of joyous coma with commentary about kids at Christmas flying around.\nBut I'm not. In fact, I'm a little disappointed in all three of these products and I'm more than a little hesitant about the soon to be released Google Wifi after using these other #madebygoogle products. I'm frustrated because the only thing stopping each of these products from being the best things in their respective categories is how entirely unfinished their biggest features are.\nHashtag Eventually \nGoogle's new Pixel phones are incredible. That camera! The UI is so snappy even after I've actively tried to bog it down! It just feels like a great phone when you hold it, and I'm finally over missing my Note 7 now that Daydream is here. Only, it's not quite finished, is it? Google Assistant, the big thing that is supposed to take these phones to the next level, is still very much a beta. Some of that is to be expected, Google is at their best when they have lots of real people to use as digital lab rats. Some of the things that got overlooked before shipping I have a real problem with, like not being able to tell me the name of a song when I ask. Google Assistant is supposed to be the future, but it isn't yet as capable as Google Now? Come on now, that's just bad form.\nSERIOUSLY?! pic.twitter.com/cH4B4bPfKW \n— Russell Holly (@russellholly) November 4, 2016 I want a Google Home in every room. The speaker is great, better than any other Google Cast speaker you could get at that price, but half of the features Google showed us at the launch event don't exist yet. You can Chromecast YouTube with your voice, which is kinda neat, but Netflix and Google Play Movies support are nowhere to be found. Communicating with Nest and Hue works on a basic level, but none of the Google Assistant threaded conversation stuff works in that context. I can't say \"can you turn them back on\" after asking Home to turn out the lights, which is supposed to be the whole point of this platform. It's supposed to learn from me and feel like a conversation. When does that start?\nStepping up from Google Cardboard to Daydream is a revelation. A mobile VR headset with lots of streaming video choices means I can lose myself in a movie on a flight, or play a game while waiting in the car for my kids to get out of school. The headset looks nice, feels great, and the Pixel XL is superb as a VR display. But ever since Google I/O we've been hearing about how Daydream will support many different phones and be a high-end democratized platform. So far not even LG's V20, the other Nougat phone, actually has Daydream support on the way. As long as you have a Pixel and are cool with only 19 apps while others trickle in, it's awesome.\nSeeing a pattern here? It's not a good look.\nShipping is hard, but it's time to step up \nThe truth is, Google's relationship with shipping hardware has always been a little dicey. How many Nexus launches were totally shut down because the biggest internet company in the world wouldn't figure out a shopping cart solution that could handle a couple hundred thousand people at once? Almost all of them is the answer, just in case you were wondering.\nThis year is a little different. Google's strategy has changed, and getting the hardware out there has been a lot less painful. It's great hardware, too. There's no denying the design team has been putting out quality gear, but the software for some reason doesn't match and that's a real shame. Right now Google has a collection of really great ideas inside of very attractive packaging, but precious few complete thoughts. A good bit of this is just how Google software works. This is a company that thrives on millions of data points, and putting your software out there in the world lets you quickly collect those data points. That data collection lets Google iterate quickly and as long as the product isn't totally abandoned Nexus Q style, things improve pretty quickly.\nI'm excited by the new direction Google is taking, but it couldn't be more clear the company has an execution problem.\nThis strategy gets highlighted this year because Google's releasing multiple products that are very clearly being sold as competition to existing heavyweights. The first real iPhone competitor directly from Google. The Google take on Amazon Echo. Mobile VR that one-ups the Gear VR. These are all category champions that have the benefit of time and have gained quite a bit of polish along the way. Google's offerings in each category this year could easily one day be clearly the best thing available, but people aren't asked to buy them later. People are being asked to buy something that has the ability to get better over time, with a frankly spotty record of that actually happening.\nI'm excited by the new direction Google is taking, but it couldn't be clearer the company has an execution problem. If you're releasing something as direct competition to something dominating a category, telling people to buy it now and watch it grow and improve isn't going to work outside of Google's early adopter bubble. These aren't early products only available in the Google Store, though. They're on the shelf at Best Buy, with big friendly boxes telling you how great they'll be once you get to know them.\n",

      "title": "Google to European Commission: Android offers more choice for consumers",
      "text": "\nIn April, the European Commission regulatory agency announced a preliminary judgement that Google violated its antitrust rules with its Android OS, claiming that it was the source of anti-competitive behavior in the smartphone market. Today, Google filed its official response to the EC decision, claiming that Android actually offers more choice for smartphone consumers.\nSee also: European Commission targets Google over further antitrust complaints July 14, 2016 In its April statement, the EC claims that Google’s decision to require that Android devices pre-install its search engine and Chrome web browser in order to get the Google Play Store was anti-competitive. It claimed that “the practices close off ways for rival search engines to access the market, via competing mobile browsers and operating systems.”\nIn its blog post today, Google stated that the EC’s decision was based on the idea that Android does not compete with Apple’s iOS ecosystem. It stated:\nWe don’t see it that way. We don’t think Apple does either. Or phone makers. Or developers. Or users. In fact, 89% of respondents to the Commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape.\nGoogle also says that they don’t insist that any Android device maker pre-install apps on their device, but rather offer them the chance to give their customers a suite of apps that offer familiar and basic services. It stated:\nAndroid’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice in the apps that come with their phones. On Android, Google’s apps typically account for less than one-third of the preloaded apps on the device (and only a small fraction of device memory). A consumer can swipe away any of our apps at any time. And, uniquely, hardware makers and carriers can pre-install rival apps right next to ours. In competition-speak, that means there’s no foreclosure.\nGoogle also notes that many pre-loaded apps on Android don’t succeed while others that have to be downloaded have been hugely successful. Finally, they insist that pre-loaded apps like Google Search are offered to Android device makers for free, with no licensing fees.\nThis free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone — it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play.\nIf the EC does decide to officially declare that Google violated its antitrust rules, it could fine the company up to 10 percent of its previous financial year’s turnover, which would come to $74.5 billion. There is no timeframe for the EC to make its final decision.",

      "text": "Google responds to EU antitrust charges against Android Posted Pinterest finds another way to track purchases via its new “Tried It” button \nGoogle has now filed its official response to the EU’s antitrust charges against its Android mobile OS. The company had previously been granted a deadline extension by the European Commission, which kicked off a formal investigation into Android back in April . \nAccording to Reuters the EC is intending to hit Google with deterrent fines over its behavior with Android, and also in another antitrust case against Google Shopping. \nAmong the complaints about Android that the EU Competition Commission has been investigating are — that Google is allegedly “requiring and incentivizing” smartphone and tablet manufacturers to exclusively install its own services, and in particular its search engine that it is allegedly bundling certain Google products with other apps & services whether Google is hindering the ability of smartphone and tablet makers to use and develop other OS versions of Android (aka Android forks) \nIn a blog post detailing the general thrust of its arguments, Google’s SVP and general counsel, Kent Walker, rebuts these charges, arguing the Android OS has created a thriving and competitive mobile app ecosystem. \n“The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it,” he writes, going on to argue that Google’s “voluntary compatibility agreements” for Android OEMs are a necessary mechanism for avoiding platform fragmentation which would make life harder for app developers. \nWalker claims the EC is overlooking a large chunk of relevant competition by not factoring in Apple’s iOS when it considers the mobile app ecosystem. \nHowever Android remains the dominant mobile OS in the region, with a marketshare of around 90 per cent as the EC sees it — hence the Commission’s focus on the platform. The EC is also factoring in Google’s regional dominance in general Internet search (circa 90 per cent of that market), which it has been investigating for some six years now — with the issue being how one dominant tech platform position might be being abused to cement another. \n“To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape,” argues Walker, also referencing iOS as an motivating factor in Google seeking to simplify developing for the Android ecosystem vs Apple’s closed source platform. \n“The Commission’s proposal risks making fragmentation worse, hurting the Android platform and mobile phone competition,” he adds. \nComplainants in the antitrust case argue that Google’s “ excessive control ” of Android makes it more akin to closed than open source. In a statement given to Reuters , FairSearch lawyer Thomas Vinje said: “The truth is that Android is today a closed operating system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous. Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity.” \nResponding to criticisms of how it requires manufacturers to pre-load a suite of its own apps on devices if they want access to the Google Play store, Walker says Google does this to present a competitive offering vs rival platforms, with their own apps preloaded, while also arguing it’s easy for consumers to delete preloaded apps or download alternatives. \nAlthough the competition point is really about whether the discoverability and visibility of a preload on a dominant platform is an unfair advantage, not that other apps are being blocked at a technical level. \nHe goes on to name-checking Spotify and Snapchat as two examples of third party app successes that have been possible despite Google’s own Android preloads. \nLastly, Walker says Google requiring Android OEMs to use Google search by default is effectively its payment for offering device makers use of the entire suite for free, i.e. without a licensing fee. “This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone — it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play,” he argues. \nHe also describes open source platforms as “fragile” and argues the Commission’s approach risks upsetting the “balance of needs” between users and developers, as well as suggesting their action could signal they favor closed “closed over open platforms”. \nBut again here, complainants would argue that the way Google controls Android makes it akin to a closed platform at this stage. \nThe EC can fine Google up to 10 per cent of its global revenue — some $7.5 billion — if it finds the company has breached European competition law. Google has already faced antitrust fines in Russia over how it operates Android . \nLast week Google also responded to the two other European Union antitrust charges — relating to its Google Shopping price comparison service, and its AdSense ad placement service. \nIn the Shopping instance, Walker argued the online shopping ecosystem has evolved beyond price comparison sites — making them irrelevant in what he described as a vibrantly competitive market, focused on other channels for reaching consumers such as retailers’ own mobile apps. \nRegarding AdSense, Google said it has made some changes to how it operates the service — in the hopes of satisfying the Commission.",

      "text": "Google uses Chrome's reach to give your phone a better web Google uses Chrome's reach to give your phone a better web A technology called progressive web apps could make mobile browsing faster and more engaging, and Google is flexing its muscle to support it. \nA Google Chrome lapel pin Stephen Shankland/CNET \nThe web has taken a beating in the smartphone era. But it's about to start beating back. \nThe web's explosive growth, starting in the 1990s, connected the world's population. In the last decade, though, we all started tapping app icons instead of web hyperlinks when it was time to chat with friends, share photos and buy products online. \nNow Google's Chrome team and browser allies from Mozilla , Opera and Microsoft are putting a new twist on things. It's called progressive web apps -- PWAs. They endow websites with many of advantages of native apps that run on Google's Android or Apple 's iOS. And they can outdo native apps when it comes to fast, hassle-free loading. \nPWAs are headlining this week at the Chrome Dev Summit , Google's two-day conference in San Francisco for programmers who want to figure out where Google is taking browser technology. Native apps hog the spotlight, but at the conference, Google will reveal a good reason why browsers generally and Chrome in particular also deserve a place on the stage: unbeatable reach. \n\"We have over 2 billion Chrome instances that are active\" each month, said Darin Fisher, Google's vice president of Chrome engineering and the conference's opening speaker. That's less than 2 billion people, because a single person can use Chrome on multiple devices, but it's still a platform with immense power. \nThat power is essential to making Google's vision become a reality. If it succeeds, that browser icon might be the one you reach for on your home screen a lot more often. \nWebsite usage tracking firm StatCounter says browser use on mobile devices just exceeded PC browsing worldwide. StatCounter \nThat success also could help restore the fortunes of the web, the closest the computing industry has come to freeing us from software that works only on one device or another, like a Windows laptop but not an iPhone . In an era when tech giants wield tremendous power, the web levels the playing field and makes it easier for new competitors to join the game. \nIt's no wonder Google is pushing the mobile web. This month, browser usage on tablets and phones for the first time surpassed usage with PCs, analytics firm StatCounter said . App fatigue \nApps might get the glory, but the web does a lot of the work already. When we need to interact with a business or service, a website is often our first point of contact. Apps are popular, with millions available in Apple and Google app stores, but it's hard to convince people to install them, and even then, most lie dormant. \nAmong American adults, \"Almost half...report that they use five or fewer apps at least once per week, and just 16 percent indicate that they use more than 10 apps on a regular basis,\" a 2016 Pew Research Center study found. And Localytics, which monitors app usage, found that 23 percent of users never reopen an app after the first time and that only about a fifth of people are likely to still use an app after three months . \nFisher isn't pronouncing a death to native apps, but he thinks PWAs means the web can shoulder more of the load. \n\"It's expensive to get people to install an app,\" Fisher said, but progressive web apps arrive fast through the browser to keep visitors happy, then download extra abilities silently in the background. For website developers, he said, \"there's really no fundamental limit to the kinds of experiences you can create.\" \nThere's a place for apps and websites, analyst firm Gartner believes. \"A mobile website is more generic, with wider reach, like your ABC or CBS or Fox or NBC channels,\" said Research Director Jason Wong. Native apps are like \"a cable channel like the Cooking Channel or MTV targeted toward a specific segment.\" Apps are great for people who use a company's services are lot, like the 10 or 15 percent of users who come back to an e-commerce site frequently, but websites are crucial for the rest. \n\"The mobile web is unavoidable. Users are using smartphones and tablets to access websites more and more. Google has changed its [search] algorithm to reward mobile-optimized websites ,\" Wong said. \"It's imperative companies move to responsive and mobile-optimized websites.\" Progressive web what? \nIf you're browsing the web, you won't see any fancy label announcing a progressive web app. But done well, you'll like it. \nThe first idea behind a PWA is that websites arrive as fast as possible in basic form so you can get started immediately, then gradually flesh themselves out in the background -- thus the term progressive. Compare that to a typical native app that often requires you to download tens of megabytes of data and wait for an installation before you can get started. \nPWAs also download components so they work offline. And they take advantage of push notification abilities for the web -- for example Carnival Cruise 's site that can prompt customers to finalize a reservation before it expires in 24 hours. And PWAs can be placed as a home-screen icon so you're more likely to use them again. \nThe results have convinced companies like the Washington Post , Housing.com in India and Chinese e-commece giant Alibaba . When Alibaba moved to a PWA, it found a website visit was 76 percent more likely to convert into a website transaction. Among Android device users, monthly usage increased 30 percent, and for those with iPhones and iPads, monthly usage increased 14 percent. \nPWAs are particularly popular in developing countries where mobile networks are slow and coverage is spotty, said Alex Komoroske, a Chrome group product manager. Using a cheap, low-end Android phone with an older 3G connection, downloading FlipKart's e-commerce native app took 14 minutes, but the company's progressive web app took 14 seconds, he said. Where's Apple? \nGoogle has built into Chrome much of the required supporting technology -- push notifications and the Service Workers standard, for example. Mozilla's Firefox and Microsoft's Edge are on board, too, making it safer for web programmers to bet on PWAs. \nApple hasn't joined the party with its Safari browser, but Fisher is optimistic. \nIf 50,000 website developers start using PWA technologies, \"you can imagine Safari engineers will see there's a lot of interest,\" Fisher said. \"Developers can have some influence, voting with their feet for what they care about.\" \nApple didn't immediately respond to a request for comment. \nApple forbids other browser makers from using their own browser engines on iPhones and iPads, so running Chrome doesn't enable PWAs to iOS. Apple's lack of support is \"a real concern for developers,\" Fisher said, but embracing the PWA approach still boosts performance on Apple's iOS-powered devices. Easier payments \nAnd progressive web apps will benefit from web payment technology where Apple is ahead, letting you easily complete a purchase with Apple Pay . A more general technology, the web payments interface , is coming to mobile browsers to connect to Android Pay , a credit card, Alibaba's AliPay service, Apple Pay, or whatever other payment mechanism your phone offers. \nIt all leads to vast improvements over the plodding, hard-to-read websites still common with mobile browsing. \n\"Everybody should be building a progressive web app,\" Fisher said. \"It just makes sense.\"",

      "text": "Eric Schmidt has something he wants to say to Peter Thiel following Donald Trump’s presidential win: Congrats.\nThe chairman of Google-parent Alphabet goog , speaking at the New York Times ‘ annual Dealbook conference, said that he didn’t think it was fair how much backlash venture capitalist Thiel, who supported Trump, received during the presidential election.\n“I am a Peter Thiel fan,” said Schmidt. “I think he is a brilliant entrepreneur. And I like a lot of the things he says.”\nSchmidt’s words are surprising not only because of the backlash that Thiel, one of the few Silicon Valley elite who backed Trump, got, but also because Schmidt was an outspoken support of Hillary Clinton himself.\nBut on Thursday, Schmidt, who is working on a book about legendary business coach Bill Campbell Fortune was the first to report on Wednesday, was squarely in the camp that America needs to come back together. “We want to have a culture where people should say what they think,” Schmidt said. “I admire what he did.”\nGet Data Sheet , Fortune's technology newsletter \nHere’s an overview of Schmidt’s most noteworthy comments during the Dealbook session:\nOn Trump winning the presidential election: “I completely congratulate the next president of the United States. Most people did not expect this outcome. And it is a pretty amazing story. My support was for the other side. I was surprised.”\nOn spending time with Julian Assange: “What it told me is that governments are capable of systematic evil. But that requires planning. And if you have a rule that any form of activity is leaked, then the government can’t go too far. The problem with this argument is he appoints himself the judge of that.”\nOn how Trump needs to work with Silicon Valley: The top five most valuable companies in America today are Apple aapl , Google googl , Amazon amzn , Facebook fb , and Microsoft msft . If the all R team is very focused on big business, there are five businesses right there. What do each and everyone of those companies need: high value, highly educated, high quality levels of immigration.”\nOn artificial intelligence and jobs: “Manufacturing is lot safer than it was a few decades ago because machines are doing the dangerous stuff that humans shouldn’t be doing. Repetitive jobs, the jobs we don’t want to do, will be replaced. Our biggest existential threat is nuclear war. I strongly disagree with the line of thinking [that it is artificial intelligence].”\nOn what was learned about email in the election: “I strongly recommend that you don’t use your own private server. And I strongly recommend you use Gmail.”",

      "text": "- Source: Ethan Yonker via Google+ \nTWRP custom recovery project lead developer Ethan \"Dees Troy\" Yonker discovered that Android 7 stores a file that shows information about how encryption passwords are composed. This file could make it easier for someone to brute-force their way into phones running the mobile operating system, code named Nougat. \nYonker found a “device_policies.xml” file in the /data/system/ folder that reveals encryption password information such as: \n<active-password quality=\"131072\" length=\"4\" uppercase=\"0\" lowercase=\"0\" letters=\"0\" numeric=\"4\" symbols=\"0\" nonletter=\"4\" /> \nThis means someone who has your phone and is trying to unlock it by brute-forcing its encryption password could do it significantly faster now. The attackers would not only be able to configure their password cracking tool to avoid searching for uppercase letters and symbols, for example, but they’d also know not to bother searching for shorter or longer passwords than necessary. Thus, the process could be less time-consuming and more precise. Android 7’s More Vulnerable File-Based Encryption \nGoogle introduced file-based encryption in Android 7, arguably for little benefit. The company said file-based encryption is necessary to help alarms survive a random phone reset or to let some apps display information even when a device is locked. However, when Google introduced this change, I expressed skepticism about it because it could allow for new ways to unlock a device and bypass its encryption thanks to new security vulnerabilities. \nIt seems that we may now be seeing the first kind of these vulnerabilities, and more may appear in the future. According to Yonker, the password information can be accessed on devices that use the password-less file-based encryption. However, if the old-style full disk encryption was used, this information would only be available after the password has already been entered. \nAccording to pseudonymous security expert The Grugq, both of Android’s encryption methods are weaker than what you can find on iOS, because all of the phone's data is unlocked even if you use full disk encryption. On iOS, the accessible data is more limited even after the phone is unlocked. Latest iOS Version Also Vulnerable To Fast Password Cracking \nHowever, the latest version of iOS also made it much easier to brute-force its passwords for encrypted backup data when it switched to a new password verification mechanism. Apple promised a fix once the revelation was made public by Elcomsoft, a mobile forensics tool company. \nIt’s unclear whether the problem in Android 7 was a simple blunder on Google’s part or if there's another reason for it. However, there are probably few good reasons for storing information about the encryption password's composition in the OS. We’ve contacted Google for an explanation and we’ll update this post when we get a reply. About the author Lucian Armasu is a Contributing Writer for Tom's Hardware US.

      "text": "How long until Facebook Frames? Posted Google says   \nSnapchat’s Spectacles are already causing huge lineups and mild millennial frenzy in LA now that they’re on sale via super-exclusive Snapbot vending machines. It’s almost inevitable that Facebook copies this, too, so gird your nose bridge for Facebook Frames. \nHere’s our exclusive (and very fake) early preview of their promo site copy, which unsurprisingly looks a lot like this one for Spectacles : Frames only show you people you agree with \nFacebook’s exclusive eyewear conveniently edits out the parts of the world that you’d find distasteful or unpleasant to look at. It’s rose-colored glasses but for whatever colors you prefer – and only those colors. Press the button to hide a valid and factual but contrasting opinion \nSee something you don’t like? Press the button on Facebook Frames to make it go away. In its place, you’ll see a comfortable and comforting fiction. Emoji display shows people what you think of them \nYou no longer have to worry about giving thought to or articulating your opinion of what people are saying to you. Facebook Frames will read your mood and display an appropriate Reaction emoji on your lenses. Wirelessly add your Frame-ups to your Facebook profile page \nGot the world looking exactly how you like it? You can share those creative interpretations of what you’re looking at directly to Facebook, where others like you can see it, too. Frames are powered by sound waves created by echoes \nNeed to charge up your Frames? They actually charge ambiently as you wear them – covering the latent power present in sound waves from echoes off of surrounding surfaces into usable juice. \nAgain, Facebook Frames aren’t real so don’t go scouring Venice Beach for a blue vending machine . But I wouldn’t be surprised if they are a thing you can actually get some day, given Facebook’s product pipeline of late. Featured Image: izusek/E+/Getty Images 0",

      "text": "Google says   Posted Google responds to EU antitrust charges against Android \nGoogle is hosting its Chrome Dev Summit today. There hasn’t been a lot of news out of the event, but one number that stood out in today’s keynote by Chrome Engineering VP Darin Fisher was that there are now 2 billion Chrome installs in active use across desktop and mobile. \nThis is the first time Google has shared this number. Sadly, Google didn’t announce any new user numbers for Chrome today. The latest stat for active Chrome users remains at 1 billion — a number Google shared in April. While this number is surely higher today than it was six months ago, the company decided to focus on the number of active browser install today. \n“I wanted to make this point that there are a lot of Chrome browsers out there,” Fisher said. “What’s exciting about this to you all is that when you think about building for the web, there’ a lot of browsers out there that implement the latest web standards — that implement the latest and greatest web features.” \nAs Google likes to say, it now has seven products with more than a billion users (Gmail, Android, Chrome, Maps, Search, Youtube and the Google Play store). 0",

      "text": "Nick Gray Nov 10th, 2016 \nAs revealed a few days back, we’ve managed to get our hands on Google’s Project ARA modular smartphone . We’ve started compiling all the questions you’ve sent in and will answer most of them in an upcoming Q&A article and video. Today, we’re sharing a full list of specifications (those that we know about) and 40 images which show off the phone’s design. \nThe ARA (A8A01) we have is likely the developer version of the ARA which Google talked about during the first half of 2016. The endoskeleton, which houses the display and the unremovable internal components, is metal, except for the insert panels covering the front-facing camera and speaker above and below the display. The modules on the back of the phone are covered is a soft-touch plastic. Similar to the early concepts Google showed off, the modules are held in place by electromagnets. While Google did state that the electromagmagnet system they were previously using was not good enough to pass internal testing, the new mechanism uses larger magnets which stick out at a 90-degree angle, allowing the modules to snap securely into place. \nThe pictures below will give you a good sense for how large the ARA is. The phone’s footprint is nearly identical to that of the HTC Desire EYE , but at 12.5mm it’s roughly 60% thicker than most 2016 flagship smartphones. As a result, it feels like you’re holding a brick when the ARA is in your hand. Developer models are always larger than consumer device, but it’s unclear how much slimmer the final ARA phone would have been if the Google didn’t cancel Project ARA.

Yesterday, the top states searching for this were Hawaii, California, Oregon, Washington, and Colorado--all of which Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton won in the election.\nIn other news: Google searches for 'how to impeach a president' have gone up by almost 5000% https://t.co/yQ4wrIot9s pic.twitter.com/euv5hukdEA \n— Amarie Baker (@SimpliSpiritu) November 9, 2016 \n\nToday, the search term “impeach Trump” is No.8 on Trump-related queries , according to Google Trends. People in Oregon, California, Washington, and Colorado are also searching for this, as are those in Vermont. Clinton won Vermont on Tuesday night with 61% of the vote.\n \nSearches for “ how to move to Canada ” also increased in the U.S. the night of Trump’s win, according to the Independent . So much so, the country’s immigration and citizenship website crashed. The same search also surged 350% after Trump’s victory on Super Tuesday . And although there were no reports of a crash, the immigration and citizenship site did displayed a warning that said users \"may experience delays while using the website,” at the time.",

      "text": "A self-driving Google car. Elijah Nouvelage / Reuters ID: 9962211 In the Obama administration, that enthusiasm for autonomous car technology trickled down from the president himself. Obama created the US Digital Service, described as a technological “SWAT team” to improve government IT, for example, by digitizing the refugee admissions process. He penned an op-ed calling self-driving cars “an emerging reality with the potential to transform the way we live.”\nOne potential Trump pick for secretary of transportation could be Rep. Bill Shuster, the Pennsylvania Republican who chairs the House transportation and infrastructure committee. Shuster endorsed Trump in April. Prior to running for Congress, he worked on his family’s farm in Bedford County, Pennsylvania, and owned an automobile dealership – experience that could resonate with Trump’s populist base. He’s been a member of the transportation committee since 2001 and previously chaired a subcommittee on railroads, pipelines, and hazardous materials, and another one on economic development, public buildings, and emergency management.\nThat said, for the transportation secretary post, president-elects often look to mayors and governors, given their day-to-day experience managing local infrastructure, transportation and traffic. Trump, who has no prior government experience himself, also could pluck his transportation secretary from the private sector.\nOn Wednesday, Trump’s team launched GreatAgain.gov, its transition website. The site includes “transportation & infrastructure” under its section for “getting America back to work again.”\n“Americans deserve a reliable and efficient transportation network and the Trump Administration seeks to invest $550 billion to ensure we can export our goods and move our people faster and safer,” the page reads , offering few other details. In a 100-day plan on his campaign website, Trump said he would spur $1 trillion in infrastructure investment over the next 10 years.\n“Trump has to get that through Congress,” LaHood said. “Probably what he’ll be doing is he and [Vice President-elect Mike Pence] will be sitting down with Paul Ryan and figuring out what the agenda will be, and hopefully infrastructure will be right at the top.”\nLaHood now co-chairs a coalition called Building America’s Future, a bipartisan infrastructure advocacy group, with ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Ed Rendell, who was one of Clinton’s advisers on infrastructure issues.\nThe infrastructure page of Trump’s campaign website says he plans to “…incorporate new technologies and innovations into our national transportation system such as state-of-the-art pipelines, advancements in maritime commerce, and the next generation of vehicles.”\n“Just looking through Trump’s plan, it just looks like there’s a lot of blanks that need to be filled in.”\nID: 9962103 The website also notes that Trump plans to make broader use of public-private partnerships, something local governments, looking to cut costs, have increasingly done by inking contracts with Uber and Lyft . “This is particularly telling when thinking about the continued growth of transportation technology – much of its development has hinged upon pilot programs between public and private organizations,” said Ann Henebery, a spokeswoman for the Eno Center for Transportation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan think tank. But, she added, “what is key to remember from a political perspective is that Trump’s campaign platform stands against everything that [automated vehicles] are: automated machines that could eventually replace low-skilled labor, that are products of largely white-collar workers, and that are most useful to those who live in urban centers.”\nGiven the lack of specifics, transportation experts are struggling to uncover policy takeaways from Trump’s “half-written, cryptic talking points,” Michael Sargent, who researches transportation issues at the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, told BuzzFeed News.\n“Just looking through Trump’s plan, it just looks like there’s a lot of blanks that need to be filled in,” Sargent said. “It seems to me like there has not been very much thought put into this. He doesn’t really mention technology.”",

      "text": "The Google strikes back.\nGoogle is hitting back against European Commission claims that by bundling all of its apps and services with most Android phones, Google is exhibiting antitrust tendencies.\n\nOn its blog today, Google's SVP and General Counsel, Kent Walker, penned a four-step rebuttal , claiming that not only is Android competitive in Europe, but it has made the market more so since its release in 2008. Says Walker:\nAndroid means manufacturers don't have to buy or build expensive mobile operating systems. As a result, smartphones are now available at dramatically lower prices — as little as 45 euros — and have become much more accessible to many more people. Today, more than 24,000 devices from over 1,300 brands run on Android. And European developers are able to distribute their apps to over a billion people around the world. Android is not a 'one way street'; it's a multi-lane highway of choice.\nSpecifically, he points to the success of the iPhone and iOS as a primary reason Google and Android should be cleared of any wrongdoing, saying that despite claims to the contrary Apple considers Android its primary competition in the mobile space.\nHe points to the success of the iPhone and iOS as a primary reason Android should be cleared of any wrongdoing.\nHe also points out that Google has to constantly balance the openness of Android as a platform with its promise to developers in maintaining a hearty and healthy marketplace for apps, which the European Commission accuses of being too Google-centric and controlled.\nWe give phone makers wide latitude to build devices that go above that baseline, which is why you see such a varied universe of Android devices. That's the key: our voluntary compatibility agreements enable variety while giving developers confidence to create apps that run seamlessly across thousands of different phones and tablets. This balance stimulates competition between Android devices as well as between Android and Apple's iPhone.\nWalker also disputes that claim that Google preloads too many of its own apps, saying that its app licensing agreement with hardware manufacturers is much more flexible than, say, Microsoft's. Apple, too, loads a number of its own apps on the iPhone and iPad, and encourages users to download its own productivity suite like Pages and Numbers the first time they open the App Store.\nHe also brings up an important point: Google is able to offer its entire software suite for free to phone makers because of the process of bundling:\nDistributing products like Google Search together with Google Play permits us to offer our entire suite for free — as opposed to, for example, charging upfront licensing fees. This free distribution is an efficient solution for everyone — it lowers prices for phone makers and consumers, while still letting us sustain our substantial investment in Android and Play.\nThe blog post was written in tandem with a filing handed over to the European Commission in response to charges of antitrust and monopolistic behavior. Now, the EC must go back and review the filing and choose whether it wants to pursue fines, which could amount to $7.5 billion, or drop the charges altogether.\n",
