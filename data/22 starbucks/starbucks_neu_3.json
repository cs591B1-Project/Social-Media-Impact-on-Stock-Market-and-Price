      "text": "In the early days of the 2016 election, when Donald Trump was just a notion and people were warming up to having a corporate CEO as president, there was considerable speculation that Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz might enter the race.\nIt wasn't a crazy idea given that Schultz has always been outspoken politically and he has not hesitated to throw his company into controversial areas. That has not always been the easiest choice for the brand as efforts at promoting discussions of race and even offering inclusive, rather than Christmas-specific, red holiday cups have resulted in negative feedback for the company.\nBefore the 2016 election, Schultz aggressively shut down the many people who thought he was a good fit for a Democratic party that had Hillary Clinton, the early rumblings of Bernie Sanders, the unlikely candidacy of Joe Biden, and little else. The CEO made it clear in a New York Times op-ed that he was not \"done serving at Starbucks.\" He bowed out of any potential candidacy by saying that \"although we have built an iconic brand while providing even part-time employees with access to healthcare, free college education and stock options, there is more we can do as a public company to demonstrate responsible leadership.\"\nContinue reading ",

He’ll stay with the company to focus on the high-end coffee market, and COO Kevin Johnson will step into the chief executive role. Howard Schultz has spoken to our show a few times, including a recent conversation about the company’s media pursuits. As CEO, he’s been a fairly vocal leader — sometimes on issues that go way beyond coffee . Now, he’ll help Starbucks battle the competition from the fanciest of fancy boutique coffee shops. \nClick the above audio player to hear the full story. Follow Lewis Wallace at @LewisPants .

      "title": "Starbucks' Schultz to Step Down: Will the Stock Lose Strength?",
      "text": "Shares of coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX - Free Report ) fell over 3% in afterhours trading on Dec 1, following the announcement that Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Howard Schultz, will step down from his post effective Apr 3, 2017.\n\nNotably, Kevin Johnson – the current President and Chief Operating Officer – who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago will take over as CEO.\n\nMeanwhile, Schultz will assume the role of executive chairman, shifting his focus to innovation, design and expansion of the high-end Starbucks Reserve Roastery concept globally.\nSTARBUCKS CORP Price \n \nSTARBUCKS CORP Price | STARBUCKS CORP Quote \nWhat’s the Fuss About? \n\nInterestingly, this is not the first time Schultz has taken a hiatus from the CEO position. Post a 13-year stint with the company, Schultz had stepped down in 2000 in order to focus on the company’s global strategy.\n\nHowever, the company clearly struggled in his absence with the stock plummeting and comps declining and thus Schultz had to return in 2008 to rescue the ailing stock.\n\nIn fact, he played a major role in turning around the company’s fortunes by overseeing the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\n\nGoing by the company’s performance the last time he left and the impact he has had on the company’s growth story, investors’ concerns about the change are quite obvious.\n\nRationale Behind & Plans Ahead \n\nStarbucks’s move toward high-end coffee is intended at refreshing its brand, which has been facing escalating competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee suppliers like Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s ( DNKN - Free Report ) Dunkin’ Donuts, which has been launching more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\n\nSchultz also aims to entice people who are increasingly shopping online to leave their homes by providing a deluxe experience via high-end coffee shops, thereby bolstering traffic.\n\nIn Dec 2014, the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and customers can purchase $12 cups of small-batch reserve coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\n\nThe massive sales performance of the company’s first such shop has in part encouraged Schultz in believing that the new concept can bring growth to the company.\n\nStarbucks is thus planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores in prominent cities around the world. The company also plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores reminiscent of the Roastery, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand, barring the on-site roasting.\n\nStarbucks is also remodeling several of its over 24,000 stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and range of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores.\n\nInterestingly, Schultz believes that the move to open high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago.\n\nOur Take \n\nThough Schultz is pretty confident of the growth prospects of its new high-end coffee shops concept, a challenging environment in the U.S. restaurant space may actually draw few customers and in fact add to the company’s costs for building these new stores.\n\nWe note that Starbuck’s shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized Retail-Food & Restaurant Market over the past six months. While the stock has gained over 7%, the broader market had witnessed a gain of mere 1% in the same time period.\n\n\nThough Starbucks continues to outperform the broader market, its growth has slowed more recently and traffic trends have remained soft of late.\n\nThus, with the news of Schultz’s departure coming at a critical juncture, it remains to be seen whether investors would still be keen on Starbucks shares sans Schultz or will history repeat itself.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider \n\nStarbucks currently has a Zacks Rank #3 ((Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include McDonald's Corp. ( MCD - Free Report ) and Papa John’s International, Inc. ( PZZA - Free Report ) . Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full-year 2016 earnings climbed 2.3% over the last 60 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.16%.\n\nPapa John’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 11.31%. Further, for 2016, earnings per share are expected to grow 19.9%.\n\nZacks’ Best Private Investment Ideas \n\nIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?\n\nOur experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

Play <iframe src=\"https://cms.marketplace.org/node/160307/player/storyplayer\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" width=\"100%\" height=\"240px\"></iframe> China Photos/Getty Images \nHoward Schultz drinks a cup of coffee at the first Starbucks store in Chongqing, China back in 2006. Story \nShares in Starbucks were sharply down early Wednesday on the news that Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping aside as CEO. He’ll stay with the company to focus on the high-end coffee market, and COO Kevin Johnson will step into the chief executive role. Howard Schultz has spoken to our show a few times, including a recent conversation about the company’s media pursuits. As CEO, he’s been a fairly vocal leader — sometimes on issues that go way beyond coffee . Now, he’ll help Starbucks battle the competition from the fanciest of fancy boutique coffee shops. \nClick the above audio player to hear the full story.

      "text": "by Paul R. La Monica @lamonicabuzz December 2, 2016: 12:44 PM ET Howard Schultz stepping down as Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson, the soon to be CEO of Starbucks, has some Venti-sized shoes to fill when he takes over for Howard Schultz. \nJohnson is replacing a legendary business leader. And Starbucks ( SBUX ) investors have to hope that this timewill be better than Schultz's first departure. \nSchultz took a step back from the top job in 2000 -- and that didn't work out all that well. Schultz returned as CEO in 2008, and after enduring theeconomy and market bottomsof the Great Recession, the stock has been on a tear. \nShares have skyrocketed more than 1,500% from their financial crisis lows. The company is now worth nearly $85 billion. \nDuring Schultz's second stint as CEO, he stepped back on the breakneck pace of store openings in the U.S., which had led to saturation and the joke in \"Best in Show\" about a couple who met while they were at separate Starbucks stores across the street from each other. \nStarbucks also pushed more into overseas markets, particularly China. \nSo it's no wonder that shareholders appear a bit nervous. Shares of Starbucks fell nearly 3% Friday morning. And the stock has taken a bit of a break this year, dipping 5% after a nearly 50% jump in 2015. \nMeanwhile, one of Starbucks' main U.S. rivals, Dunkin' Brands ( DNKN ) , is up more than 25% this year. \nSo in some respects, Johnson succeeding Schultz is like Tim Cook taking over for Steve Jobs at Apple ( AAPL , Tech30 ) . Just as Cook has never (and probably will never) escape the Jobs' shadow, Johnson will constantly be compared to Schultz. \nRelated: Starbucks CEO Schultz to step down -- again \nOf course, Apple has done just fine under Cook. The company is the most valuable in America, worth $580 billion. Shares have more than doubled since Cook became CEO in August 2011. \nBut the stock has lost some of its mojo lately. It's down nearly 20% from a record high more than a year ago. Apple skeptics argue that Cook has yet to introduce anything truly innovative since taking over. \nStill, it might be easier for Johnson to keep pleasing Wall Street once he takes over from Schultz next April. \nFor one, Schultz isn't actually going anywhere. He will remain the company's executive chairman and is expected to focus on the higher-end Starbucks Reserve brand and the expansion of its Reserve Roastery & Tasting Room format, which some have dubbed the Willy Wonka of coffee shops. There is one in Seattle and there are plans to open six more over the next few years. \nRelated: Starbucks and other big companies want Trump to stand by climate change deal \nIt's also important to note that Johnson, who before joining Starbucks as its COO in 2015 was the CEO of tech firm Juniper Networks ( JNPR ) and also had worked at Microsoft ( MSFT , Tech30 ) and IBM ( IBM , Tech30 ) , has been a CEO of a publicly traded company before. So he knows how to deal with Wall Street and understands the rigors of being the top guy. \nPlus, Starbucks is increasingly relying on technology -- and mobile in particular -- to boost sales. That makes Johnson, despite a lack of retail experience, a good fit for the CEO job. \nAs I noted when Johnson was first hired, Schultz praised Johnson for his \"mobile and digital expertise\" during a conference call with analysts. The word \"mobile\" was mentioned 34 times during that call -- identical to the number of references for the word \"coffee.\" \nRelated: Kevin Johnson has the tech chops needed to lead Starbucks \nAnalysts think Johnson has what it takes to keep the company's hyper-caffeinated momentum on track as well. \n\"With Starbucks' business becoming increasingly more technology-oriented, Mr. Johnson's tech background (for example, as 2008-13 CEO of Juniper Networks) should serve him well,\" wrote Instinet analyst Mark Kalinowski in a report Friday. \nKalinowski noted that the fact Schultz isn't going anywhere is a plus, too. After all, Schultz was a bit more distracted the first time he stepped down as CEO. He owned the Seattle Sonics NBA team (which has since moved and become the Oklahoma City Thunder) from 2001 to 2006. \nKalinowski also pointed out that Starbucks actually had two CEOs after Schultz. The first, Orin Smith, led Starbucks from 2000 to 2005 and did reasonably well. It wasn't until Jim Donald succeeded Smith that the company's fortunes started to turn south. \nWhat's more, Hillary Clinton's loss to Donald Trump also could turn out to be a positive for Starbucks. \nThere have been rumors for years about Schultz' own political aspirations. And some felt that if Clinton -- who Schultz had endorsed - had won, then he might have been up for a job in her administration. That's all moot now, of course. \nRelated: Did election jitters lead to slowdown in Pumpkin Spice Latte sales? \nBTIG analyst Peter Saleh added that he also thinks the comparisons to Schultz stepping down as CEO now and when he did so 16 years ago aren't really apt. \n\"The brand, retail offering and customer engagement are all much more established today. This provides us with some confidence that the near and long-term prospects won't change,\" Saleh wrote in a report Friday. \nSo it looks like Wall Street thinks Johnson will do just fine as CEO. But if he stumbles, then Schultz (who I dubbed the best CEO ever back in 2013) might have to prove that the third time's a charm. CNNMoney (New York) First published December 2, 2016: 12:44 PM ET",

      "text": "What To Expect From Starbucks' CEO Shuffle — Shaky Or Seamless? (Investor's Business Daily) \nFollowing an announcement from Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) regarding the stepping down of its CEO Howard Schultz, Stephens said it does not anticipate a major shift in business. \nThe company also announced that chief operating officer Kevin Johnson will take over from Schultz, effective April 3, and the latter will remain on the board and serve as executive chairman. Schultz will lead the development of Starbucks Reserve stores and Roasteries around the world, the company noted. \nAnalyst Will Slabaugh thinks investors are likely to be concerned, given that Schultz has the most impressive track record of any CEO in the industry. That said, the analyst does not expect any major shift in business. \nStephens said it remains Equal Weight, primarily due to valuation and it has a $58 price target on the shares of the company. \nAt time of writing, shares of Starbucks were down 2.63 percent at 56.97.

      "title": "Starbucks' Schultz to Step Down: Will the Stock Lose Strength? - December 2, 2016",
      "text": "Shares of coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX - Free Report ) fell over 3% in afterhours trading on Dec 1, following the announcement that Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Howard Schultz, will step down from his post effective Apr 3, 2017.\nNotably, Kevin Johnson – the current President and Chief Operating Officer – who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago will take over as CEO.\nMeanwhile, Schultz will assume the role of executive chairman, shifting his focus to innovation, design and expansion of the high-end Starbucks Reserve Roastery concept globally.\nSTARBUCKS CORP Price\nSTARBUCKS CORP Price | STARBUCKS CORP Quote:\nWhat’s the Fuss About?\nInterestingly, this is not the first time Schultz has taken a hiatus from the CEO position. Post a 13-year stint with the company, Schultz had stepped down in 2000 in order to focus on the company’s global strategy.\nHowever, the company clearly struggled in his absence with the stock plummeting and comps declining and thus Schultz had to return in 2008 to rescue the ailing stock.\nIn fact, he played a major role in turning around the company’s fortunes by overseeing the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nGoing by the company’s performance the last time he left and the impact he has had on the company’s growth story, investors’ concerns about the change are quite obvious.\nRationale Behind & Plans Ahead\nStarbucks’s move toward high-end coffee is intended at refreshing its brand, which has been facing escalating competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee suppliers like Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s ( DNKN - Free Report ) Dunkin’ Donuts, which has been launching more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.\nSchultz also aims to entice people who are increasingly shopping online to leave their homes by providing a deluxe experience via high-end coffee shops, thereby bolstering traffic.\nIn Dec 2014, the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and customers can purchase $12 cups of small-batch reserve coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.\nThe massive sales performance of the company’s first such shop has in part encouraged Schultz in believing that the new concept can bring growth to the company.\nStarbucks is thus planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores in prominent cities around the world. The company also plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores reminiscent of the Roastery, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand, barring the on-site roasting.\nStarbucks is also remodeling several of its over 24,000 stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and range of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores.\nInterestingly, Schultz believes that the move to open high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago.\nOur Take\nThough Schultz is pretty confident of the growth prospects of its new high-end coffee shops concept, a challenging environment in the U.S. restaurant space may actually draw few customers and in fact add to the company’s costs for building these new stores.\nWe note that Starbuck’s shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized Retail-Food & Restaurant Market over the past six months. While the stock has gained over 7%, the broader market had witnessed a gain of mere 1% in the same time period.\nThough Starbucks continues to outperform the broader market, its growth has slowed more recently and traffic trends have remained soft of late.\nThus, with the news of Schultz’s departure coming at a critical juncture, it remains to be seen whether investors would still be keen on Starbucks shares sans Schultz or will history repeat itself.\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\nStarbucks currently has a Zacks Rank #3 ((Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include McDonald's Corp. ( MCD - Free Report ) and Papa John’s International, Inc. ( PZZA - Free Report ) . Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full-year 2016 earnings climbed 2.3% over the last 60 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.16%.\nPapa John’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 11.31%. Further, for 2016, earnings per share are expected to grow 19.9%.\nZacks’ Best Private Investment Ideas\nIn addition to the recommendations that are available to the public on our website, how would you like to follow all Zacks' private buys and sells in real time?\nOur experts cover all kinds of trades… from value to momentum . . . from stocks under $10 to ETF and option moves . . . from stocks that corporate insiders are buying up to companies that are about to report positive earnings surprises.

      "text": "Howard Schultz, chairman and CEO of Starbucks SHARES \nHoward Schultz , the legendary leader of Starbucks coffee, is a billionaire three times over . He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention. \nThe news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants . \"I willed it to happen. I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\" -Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO of Starbucks \nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008. \nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020. \nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story. Humble beginnings \nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie. \nHis father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home. \nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees. Getty Images Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz greets employees at a Starbucks in Charleston, N.C. \nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\" \nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home. \n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\" \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\" -Howard Schultz, Chairman and CEO of Starbucks \nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\" \nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company. Rising through the ranks \nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores. \nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses. \nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company. Adam Jeffery | CNBC Howard Schultz on Mad Money. \nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\" \nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far. \nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce. A leading voice \nSchultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight. \n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\" \nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand. \nHe has accumulated a stack of awards , including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management. show chapters",

      "title": "So Starbucks Is Getting A New CEO; Will It Work This Time?",
      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down , a fact that’s causing investors a bit of worry.\n. Starbucks Starbucks ‘ ( SBUX ) share price fell almost 2.6% to $57 Friday morning after suffering an even bigger drop during after-hours trading Thursday following the announcement . COO Kevin Johnson will become CEO, with Schultz focusing on a new line of high-end coffee shops.\nBut the timing to the CEO transition is surprising, says Credit Suisse analyst Jason West, given the upcoming investors day meeting on Dec. 7 and Schultz’s age. The Starbuck’s founder is just 63 years old. But West noted that the company suggested the management change had been discussed internally for months.\nYet same-store sales have been slowing, though from very high levels, and the business ran into trouble the last time Schultz stepped back from the CEO role.\nYet not everyone is worried about the new management change. Wells Fargo’s Bonnie Herzog declared that while Schultz’s departure is “a loss, in our view the show must (and will) go on.” She suggested that investors use any weakness in the share price as a buying opportunity ahead of next week’s investor meeting, during which the company is expected to deliver news on current and future initiatives.\nWhile we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue…\nHerzog goes into more detail:\nThe leadership change announced today has been a long-time in the making, starting nearly 3 years ago with the shuffling of the senior leadership team, and subsequent promotion of Johnson in early 2015 to the role of President/COO. We believe that Johnson is a very capable leader, with strong experience working side-by-side Schultz for the past two years. Importantly Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course… We believe Johnson’s technology background positions him well to ensure SBUX’s mobile and digital initiatives–key to SBUX’s long-term success, in our view–will remain a primary focus of the company. Importantly, Schultz will remain focused on his ongoing efforts to premiumize the SBUX brand and experience through Roastery and Reserve stores, which should support accelerated innovation and allow the broader store network led by Johnson to continue to thrive.",

      "text": "Food & Drink Starbucks Secret Menu Drinks When PSLs Get Old Don’t be the person who orders the same grande black coffee every day. These Starbucks secret menu drinks will take your morning to the next level. by Liz Biscevic Dec 1st, 2016 \nYes, we know. The holidays are all about the Pumpkin Spice Lattes, but let’s be honest—they get old fast and often times you just don’t want four “pumps” of anything when you’re looking to fuel your day. Most coffee addicts already know that most mainstream coffee bars have a secret menu, meant only for the regulars and coffee elite, but with chains like Starbucks, sometimes you just go for the most hyped product when you’re looking to indulge. Here are a few alternatives when the PSLs get old. Starbucks Secret Menu Drinks: Holiday Flavors \nCandy Cane Frappuccino: You don’t have to wait for the holidays to get all of the Christmas flavors! This simple, peppermint flavored frap will have you singing carols in no time. \nApple Pie Frappuccino: Though we don’t know what’s in it, the Apple Pie Frap tastes as though you were literally drinking an apple pie. This is perfect for anyone who’s looking to get there Thanksgiving fix without the prep time. \nPumpkin Pie Frappuccino: It’s like the seasonal PSL Frap, only with a pump of cinnamon dolce and candy sprinkles. Go for this if you want an extra zing to every sip! \nChocolate Pumpkin Latte: It’s a standard PSL with an extra pump of chocolate syrup. What more can you ask for? \nChristmas Cookie Frappuccino: Part vanilla, part peppermint, this frap makes you taste all of the flavors of the holidays straight from one cup! Also: Take a Road Trip This Winter to Some of the Best Beer Festivals in America Caffeinated Desserts \nCake Batter Frappuccino: The Cake Batter Frap is a standard Vanilla Frap with some extra almond and vanilla bean flavor. The result is a smooth, creamy substitution for eating actual cake batter. \nChocolate Covered Strawberry Frappuccino: Who doesn’t like chocolate covered strawberries? This off menu frap is a deep red color with a flavor that’s just as romantic as the name demands. \nCookies and Cream Frappuccino : Part chocolate, part vanilla bean, this black and white frap tastes more like a milkshake than any coffee beverage you’ve ever consumed, and it’s just as good. \nCotton Candy Frappuccino: The Cotton Candy Frap is an uncaffeinated, sweet pink drink that makes you feel like you’re a kid again. \nTwix Frappuccino: If you’re a fan of the iconic Caramel Frappuccino, the Twix is a must-try! It has all of the sweetness of the caramel, but the extra pump of chocolate makes for a delightful combination. \nCaramel Snickerdoodle Macchiato: Based on the Iced Soy Caramel Macchiato, the Caramel Snickerdoodle is an upside-down, layered drink that features vanilla and cinnamon syrups atop of espresso and soy milk. \nThin Mint Frappuccino: Cool mint meets rich, chocolaty java, and that’s what makes this secret frat something you NEED to experience. Cereal-Inspired \nCaptain Crunch Berry Frappuccino: Caramel, toffee, hazelnut, oh my! If you’re looking for a blast from the past, this frap will have you back to your elementary school days! \nCinnamon Toast Crunch Frappuccino: Who says Cinnamon Toast Crunch is just for kids? This off-menu combo has all of the sweet, cinnamon flavors topped with a salty crunch! \nFruity Pebbles Frappuccino: We have no idea what’s in this delicious concoction, but we know it tastes just like our favorite kid cereal, and that’s what matters here guys. Extra Caffeinated \nDirty Chai: Served either hot or cold, the dirty chai is a delicious chai latte with an extra shot of espresso. This gives your chai just a kick of extra caffeine without going too nuts. \nThe Undertow: This drink is a sweetened coffee with milk at the bottom. Once the coffee has naturally blended with the milk, they add two shots of espresso to the top. This is served in a smaller cup, and is usually drank like a shot, though it’s normally too big for that. \nBlack Eye: A regular coffee with two extra shots of espresso. This drink will have you awake for hours. \nGreen Eye: A regular coffee with THREE extra shots of espresso. This is the highest caffeinated drink on the Starbucks secret menu, and should be ordered with caution. \nLiquid Cocaine: Considered one of the most intense drinks you can order, the liquid cocaine is a glass of ice with four shots of espresso poured over and then topped with four pumps of white chocolate syrup. The sweetness of the syrup cuts the bitterness of the coffee, but the sugar-caffeine combo can make for one terrible headache later if you’re not used to it. Fun Drinks \nButterbeer Frappuccino: For the Harry Potter fan, this butterbeer will make you feel like you’ve been transported right into Hogsmead. Part toffee nut and part caramel, this frap is similar to the seasonal salted caramel option, only with a slightly buttery, nutty flavor. \nBlue Drink: Iced Passion Tango Tea, coconut milk and vanilla syrup is a sweet way to start the day! \nGreen Drink: Matcha-green tea meets delicious smoothie for a healthy, delicious alternative to your morning brew. \nOrange Drink: It’s basically an orange creamsicle in a cup. If you didn’t know, now you know. \nThe possibilities are truly endless. Rather than going for that basic PSL, go off-menu and satisfy any craving that’s calling you. ",

      "title": "Schultz To Step Down As Starbucks CEO, Focus On Innovation",
      "text": "NEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand.\nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3.\nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.\nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change.\nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading.\nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time.\nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.”\n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said.\nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu.\nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point.\nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings – a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.”\n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said.\nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO.\nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.\n \nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.\n",

      "text": "Schultz To Step Down As Starbucks CEO Candive Choi, Associated Press  26 AM Howard Schultz, president and chief executive officer of Starbucks delivers his speech at the Starbucks Partner Family Forum in Beijing on April 18, 2012. China will become the company second largest market outside US by 2014, and to have over 1,500 stores across more than 70 cities by 2015. AFP PHOTO / LIU JIN (Photo credit should read LIU JIN/AFP/Getty Images) Starbucks President and CEO Howard Schultz (Getty Images) \nNEW YORK (AP) – Starbucks Chairman Howard Schultz is stepping down as CEO of the coffee chain he joined more than 30 years ago and transformed into a globally known brand. \nSchultz will become executive chairman in April to focus on innovation such as high-end shops and social impact activities, the Seattle-based chain announced Thursday. Kevin Johnson, who was named president and chief operating officer last year, will be chief executive as of April 3. \nSince returning as the company’s CEO in 2008, Schultz is credited with turning around Starbucks’ fortunes. He has overseen the expansion of the chain’s food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app. \nStarbucks has credited the rewards program and app for helping consistently increase sales in the U.S., although growth has slowed more recently and traffic slipped in the latest quarter. Schultz has said such technology adaptions will become increasingly critical for brick-and-mortar retail businesses to thrive as shopping habits change. \nInvestor concerns about the change sent shares of Starbucks down 3.6 percent to $56.41 in after-hours trading. \nDuring a conference call about the CEO announcement, an analyst called Schultz a “master merchant” who has been able to determine and even stimulate “what the Starbucks customer wants and needs” and asked if that “merchant gene” would still be present in those leading the company. Another noted that Starbucks struggled after Schultz stepped away as CEO in 2000, and asked what was different this time. \nSchultz, 63, said Starbucks has built a strong leadership team in recent years. He also noted that he is not leaving the company, and will be working on developing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries, which are high-end retail concepts featuring coffee beans and drinks like “cold brew” coffee. Schultz called it the “next wave of retail innovation.” \n“But Kevin and the team are in charge,” Schultz said. \nIn a note issued before Starbucks’ announcement, RBC Capital Markets analyst David Palmer said he believed the company can regain its domestic sales momentum by focusing on expanding its rewards program and the changes it is making to its food menu. \nOver the years, Schultz has said that people expect more from public companies, and has aligned himself and Starbucks with social issues like race and jobs for underprivileged youth. In September, he publicly endorsed Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton in an interview with CNN, and did not rule out running for office at some point. \nIn a call with employees, Schultz said the company was not perfect, but it was authentic. Starbucks was criticized for having baristas write, “race together” on cups last year in the wake of police shootings – a move Schultz told employees he’d do again “in a heartbeat.” \n“It was one of my proudest moments,” he said. \nJohnson, 56, will take charge of the company’s global business and operations. He joined the Starbucks board in 2009, and spent years at technology companies including 16 years with Microsoft and five as Juniper Networks CEO. \nWells Fargo analyst Bonnie Herzog said she believes Johnson’s technology background will help ensure Starbucks’ digital initiatives will remain a priority.",

      "text": "By Johanna Bennett Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down , a fact that’s causing investors a bit of worry.\n. Starbucks Starbucks ‘ ( SBUX ) share price fell almost 2.6% to $57 Friday morning after suffering an even bigger drop during after-hours trading Thursday following the announcement . COO Kevin Johnson will become CEO, with Schultz focusing on a new line of high-end coffee shops.\nBut the timing to the CEO transition is surprising, says Credit Suisse analyst Jason West, given the upcoming investors day meeting on Dec. 7 and Schultz’s age. The Starbuck’s founder is just 63 years old. But West noted that the company suggested the management change had been discussed internally for months.\nYet same-store sales have been slowing, though from very high levels, and the business ran into trouble the last time Schultz stepped back from the CEO role.\nYet not everyone is worried about the new management change. Wells Fargo’s Bonnie Herzog declared that while Schultz’s departure is “a loss, in our view the show must (and will) go on.” She suggested that investors use any weakness in the share price as a buying opportunity ahead of next week’s investor meeting, during which the company is expected to deliver news on current and future initiatives.\nWhile we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue…\nHerzog goes into more detail:\nThe leadership change announced today has been a long-time in the making, starting nearly 3 years ago with the shuffling of the senior leadership team, and subsequent promotion of Johnson in early 2015 to the role of President/COO. We believe that Johnson is a very capable leader, with strong experience working side-by-side Schultz for the past two years. Importantly Johnson has an exceptionally good relationship with Schultz, which should keep Schultz sufficiently removed to allow Johnson to lead effectively given his trust in Johnson, while also remaining sufficiently nearby to ensure the ship remains on course… We believe Johnson’s technology background positions him well to ensure SBUX’s mobile and digital initiatives–key to SBUX’s long-term success, in our view–will remain a primary focus of the company. Importantly, Schultz will remain focused on his ongoing efforts to premiumize the SBUX brand and experience through Roastery and Reserve stores, which should support accelerated innovation and allow the broader store network led by Johnson to continue to thrive.",

      "text": "\n© 2016 Time Inc. All rights reserved. Here’s What Wall Street Is Saying About Starbucks’ CEO Stepping Down \nLong-tenured Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz is stepping down next year from that role so he can spend more time focusing on the coffee giant’s push into more premium retail and coffee experiences. So how did Wall Street digest the news? \nStarbucks sbux stock slipped in after-hours trading on Thursday and shares were down around 2.5% in mid-day trading on Friday. The news is a jolt as Schultz has long been regarded as the visionary behind the Starbucks brand—getting well-deserved credit for helping greatly boost sales and store count globally in a competitive restaurant industry during his second run as CEO (he previously held the post between 1987-2000). \nSo what are analysts saying about the change? We’ve compiled some of their comments, which focus both on Schultz’s move and the skills that new incoming CEO Kevin Johnson brings to the table with his tech-focused expertise. \nBTIG: “The Announcement Investors Have Long Dreaded” \nThe firm, with a buy rating on the stock, says investor fears that Schultz stepping down—as he did in 2000 only to return in 2008 when the company was in trouble—are overwrought. “We tend to dismiss comparisons to Mr. Schultz’s previous retirement as CEO as we believe the brand, retail offering and customer engagement are all much more established today. This provides us with some confidence that the near and long-term prospects won’t change.” \nWells Fargo: “ Déjà Vu All Over Again” \nBonnie Herzog encourages investors to take advantage of any sell-off in the stock ahead of next week’s Investor Day event, which she believes will help lift shares again. “While we acknowledge that Schultz is without question one of the strongest and most visionary leaders in the consumer/retail world, we believe the succession planning put in place several years ago assures the recent exceptional performance will likely continue.” Herzog adds Johnson’s technology background can help ensure Starbucks investments in mobile and digital remain a primary focus. She rates the stock outperform. \nBaird Equity Research: “CEO Transition Poses An Additional Risk” \nWhile the bank is “highly reassured” that Schultz will remain actively involved in Starbucks in the near term via his chairman role, “we acknowledge risk that the CEO transition announcement could serve as a precursor to him becoming less involved over time.” Encouragingly, Baird says Starbucks is well positioned as the firm expects the specialty coffee category to post sales increases at an above-average pace in upcoming years, especially considering the low penetration for specialty coffee (consumed daily by 31% of population) relative to overall coffee consumption (59%). \nOppenheimer: “New Focus For Howard Schultz” \nCalling Schultz “one of the best CEOs we’ve ever covered,” the bank says it is encouraged that the executive will remain actively involved with a new focus surrounding “growing the Starbucks Reserve Roasteries globally, the Reserve store format and social initiatives. As a result, he will no longer be involved in running the day-to-day operations of the company, but will remain an invaluable resource.” Oppenheimer added, “While disappointing to see a visionary and founder step back from day-to-day operations, we believe the company is left in the capable hands of Mr. Johnson. And, we do not believe Mr. Schultz would step away from daily operations without feeling the same way.” \nGuggenheim: “Schultz Stepping Aside Again, But is He Leaving on a High Note?” \nThe bank expressed some concerns Starbucks losing an “irreplaceable merchant,” especially as there are several risks that could pressure the stock, including minimum wage pressures, potential commodity cost increases, and worries sales growth could slow if food and mobile’s contribution to the top line loses momentum. Guggenheim also notes that new CEO Johnson previously served as CEO of Juniper Networks jnpr for five years between late 2008 through early 2014. What’s worrisome? The stock appreciated 24% over that period, underperforming the 91% increase for the S&P 500. \nBMO Capital Markets: “Optimistic This Leadership Transition Will Be Different Than the Last” \nLike many other Wall Street observers, BMO referenced the concerns about leadership transition after Schultz had to swoop back in to save the Starbucks brand in 2008. The bank says it is less worried about this succession because Johnson has been “co-authoring” the Starbucks strategy since becoming COO in 2015 and “his near-term focus likely will be on executing the already established strategy as he becomes increasingly acclimated to the CEO role. BMO advises investors keep an eye on the Starbucks Investor Day on December 7. “Management intends to share details for reserve stores, including the launch of a new product category,” the bank said.

He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention.\nQuote: s in the article Starbucks Corp SBUX\n▼ 57.21 -1.30 -2.22% Xerox Corp XRX\n▲ 9.50 +0.05 +0.53% The news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants .\nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008.\nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020.\nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story.\nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie.\n© Provided by CNBC His father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home.\nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees.\nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\"\nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home.\n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\"\nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\"\nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company.\nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores.\nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses.\nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company.\nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\"\nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far.\nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce.\n© Provided by CNBC Schultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight.\n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\"\nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand.\nHe has accumulated a stack of awards , including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management.\nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \" For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice \" (2014) and \" Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul \" (2011).\nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence.\n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention.\nThe news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants .\nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008.\nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020.\nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story.\nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie.\n© Provided by CNBC His father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home.\nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees.\nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\"\nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home.\n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\"\nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\"\nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company.\nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores.\nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses.\nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company.\nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\"\nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far.\nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce.\n© Provided by CNBC Schultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight.\n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\"\nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand.\nHe has accumulated a stack of awards , including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management.\nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \" For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice \" (2014) and \" Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul \" (2011).\nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence.\n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "The twinkling lights. The Starbucks cups. The fa-la-la-la-laing.\nAll of those things are fine for getting into the seasonal spirit. But it’s not really the holidays until you read an article about avoiding weight gain. In the December issue of Women’s Health , Paige Fowler offers this new twist on the usual advice: Eat like an animal.\nHer theory is that “birds and beasts spend three-quarters of their waking lives acquiring and consuming food — but never get fat. Sooo, who better to go to for diet advice?”\nNo actual animals appear to have been consulted in the reporting of this story. Instead, Fowler focuses on a few habits of five creatures and then suggests how humans might ape them (although it’s monkeys, not apes, that are included in this list).\nIn most cases, the goal is to glean a lesson from the animals rather than behave exactly like them. Penguins, for instance, are lauded because they “take a break from food.” Their month-long fasts become inspiration for holding off on late-night snacking. Cows, which “gulp more than 2,000 ounces of H2O daily,” are smart about staying hydrated. If you do the same, you won’t confuse thirst for hunger. And those monkeys like to grab whatever fruit they can find nearby. The lesson for humans: Keep a fruit bowl in a prominent spot in your kitchen, and always stock your fridge with fresh-cut veggies.\nAs you hit the party circuit, consider the sheep that wore your woolen sweater before you did. She probably chewed and chewed and chewed each bite of her meals, a trick that can make you feel more satisfied.\nAnd if you find yourself leaving a buffet feeling like a whale? Try to act more like one next time. They “don’t fear fat,” Fowler notes. By eating food with normal levels of fat, you can feel fuller — and better able to resist all of those sugary, carb-laden cookies.",

      "text": "Schultz wants to make Starbucks more upscale By CRAIG GIAMMONA Bloomberg News First Published 8 hours ago • Updated 6 minutes ago Share This Article Howard Schultz, the billionaire who built a caffeine empire by bringing Italian coffee culture to the American mainstream, is ready for his next project: Starbucks 2.0. Schultz, who will become executive chairman when he steps down as chief executive officer at Starbucks Corp. next year, says he'll focus on his three-pronged bet that the world's largest coffee chain needs to become more upscale. The program includes a line of premium coffee called Reserve, as many as 1,000 cafes that will showcase the new brand and flagship stores as large as 20,000 square feet called Roasteries. The 63-year-old executive will soon be free from the daily grind of running a $21 billion business, allowing him to devote his attention to a key initiative that's been slow to gain momentum over the past two years. VIDEOS TOP JOBS \"When you're making an investment and taking a risk like this, there's no better person to spearhead it than Howard,\" said Darren Tristano, president of Technomic Inc., which tracks the restaurant industry. \"He has a very high chance of succeeding in this type of role and helping the brand evolve.\" With more shopping done online, Schultz has said he wants to emulate the brick-and-mortar retail experiences offered by innovators like Nike and Apple. Starbucks opened the first Roastery location two years ago, a 15,000-square-foot emporium in its hometown of Seattle, and is planning others in New York, Shanghai and Tokyo. The menu includes small-lot coffee from around the world that can sell for more than $20 a pound. The cavernous stores, where customers can watch coffee being roasted on site, are envisioned as high-end flagships for the company, but rollout has been slowed by high construction costs and trouble finding suitable real estate. Analysts are skeptical that a handful of Roasteries can move the needle for the massive company, which operates more than 16,000 cafes worldwide. Instead, they say financial growth is expected to come from the Reserve locations. The new cafes are planned to be similar to the Roasteries but without the actual bean-cooking operation. It's part of a move by Schultz to add different store concepts around the world and reimagine the 45-year-old chain. \"He's always had grand visions for where Starbucks can go,\" said Jennifer Bartashus, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. \"The ability for him to separate himself from the day-to-day running of the company and focus on big ideas is well within his wheelhouse.\" Starbucks said Schultz wasn't available to be interviewed for this article. To be sure, there are risks in going more upscale. Some customers already balk at paying more than $5 for a coffee drink, and with rising health-care costs and stagnant wage growth causing anxiety among U.S. consumers, the effort could run into headwinds, particularly if there's an economic downturn, Bartashus said. Starbucks needs the Reserve cafes to work because there's more and more competition from local and regional chains that are pulling in younger customers. To secure the next generation of consumers, Starbucks has to convince millennials that it's a cool place for coffee -- a difficult proposition after four decades that saw the company grow to become a mainstream brand like McDonald's. Starbucks is also pushing into the Chinese market, with plans to open hundreds of stores. Growing domestically won't be easy given the rise of competitors such as Blue Bottle, Stumptown and Intelligentsia, independent chains that cater to a premium audience. It's those chains that are pressuring Starbucks, in addition to mainstream competitors like Dunkin' Donuts or Coffee & Bagels, a new chain being developed by JAB Holding Co. The European investment firm backed by Austria's billionaire Reimann family has used acquisitions, including Stumptown and Krispy Kreme, to build its own coffee empire. When Schultz acquired the then-six-unit chain in the late 1980s, it wasn't typical for Americans to spend hours in a cafe sipping expensive coffee. That changed, and with Starbucks established as a daily ritual for millions of Americans, Schultz is once again focused on changing their habits. The move upscale is in line with where the restaurant has been heading in recent years, and it helps that Starbucks sells a product that most customers consume daily and consider an affordable luxury, said Peter Saleh, an analyst at BTIG Research. \"Being a premium brand is where it's at in this industry,\" he said. \"People gravitate to more and more expensive coffee.\"",

He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention.\nQuote: s in the article Starbucks Corp SBUX\n▼ 57.21 -1.30 -2.22% Xerox Corp XRX\n▲ 9.50 +0.05 +0.53% The news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants .\nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008.\nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020.\nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story.\nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie.\n© Provided by CNBC His father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home.\nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees.\nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\"\nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home.\n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\"\nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\"\nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company.\nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores.\nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses.\nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company.\nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\"\nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far.\nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce.\n© Provided by CNBC Schultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight.\n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\"\nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand.\nHe has accumulated a stack of awards , including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management.\nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \" For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice \" (2014) and \" Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul \" (2011).\nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence.\n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention.\nThe news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 percent . Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants .\nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008.\nThis time, despite Schultz's denials , the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020.\nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story.\nSchultz, 63 years old , was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie.\n© Provided by CNBC His father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home.\nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \" Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time ,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees.\nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\"\nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home.\n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\"\nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\"\nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast U.S.A., a Swedish housewares company.\nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores.\nIn 1983, Schulz traveled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses.\nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company.\nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988 , Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\"\nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far.\nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed $30 million to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce.\n© Provided by CNBC Schultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight.\n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\"\nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand.\nHe has accumulated a stack of awards , including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management.\nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \" For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice \" (2014) and \" Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul \" (2011).\nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence.\n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\"\nGo to MSN Home",

      "text": "Tweet \nBEVERLY HILLS – God bless America, and how’s everybody? \nStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz last week announced he will be stepping down as head of the company. In this past month, Howard Schultz has stepped down, Hillary has been defeated and Fidel Castro has died. The Democrats are waiting for ISIS to claim responsibility for Donald Trump. \nOklahoma Senator James Lankford released his annual list of wasteful government spending Monday which found a quarter trillion in inefficient and wasteful spending. Take for instance the salary of the Chaplain of the U.S. Senate. Only a mind-reader in Los Angeles does less work every day. \nThe Los Angeles coroner’s office is set to bury fourteen hundred and thirty unclaimed bodies together in a mass grave later this week. It can’t be said often enough. Once your TV series gets canceled, jump onto another TV show immediately because they forget about you quickly in this town. \nDonald Trump invited TV cameras to show him enjoying dinner with Mitt Romney Wednesday at a four-star French restaurant in New York. The president-elect dined on garlic soup with thyme and sauteed frog legs. Wait just a minute, Donald Trump’s mission is to drain the swamp, not drink it. \nDonald Trump hosted Mitt Romney at Jean-Georges French restaurant located in the Trump International Hotel. The four-star restaurant offers the finest food in the world. It provided the perfect setting for two billionaires to complain about how out-of-touch Washington is with real people. \nDonald Trump nominated General James “Mad Dog” Mattis to head the Pentagon. We have a Defense Secretary named Mad Dog, a Treasury Secretary who’s a billionaire and an Education Secretary with a thousand-foot yacht. Everybody gets to be who they are in the Trump administration. \nGarth Brooks will perform in Hawaii this week to pay tribute to the surviving U.S. veterans of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on its seventy-fifth anniversary. Pro athletes are also joining in. Johnny Manziel last night paid tribute to the veterans of the attack by downing a dozen Kamikazes. \nCalifornians are circulating a ballot petition to secede from the United States. It’s stolen goods anyway. We stole California from Mexico, who stole it from Spain, who stole it from the Indians, who walked across the Bering Strait and stole it from the coyotes and the bears, who will eat anything. \nOhio State University resumed classes after a Somali terrorist went on a rampage driving over students and stabbing them with a butcher knife. No one saw this coming. Ohio State students are simply in shock that the attacker was an Islamic terrorist and not Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh. \nNBC News reports that China’s first astronaut was terrified Friday by a knocking on the spacecraft’s cabin door while in orbit last weekend. It made sense eventually. The astronaut later went out on a space walk and he discovered a copy of The Watchtower wedged in the crack of the cabin door. \nPresident Obama and Joe Biden will be on hand for the National Menorah Lighting on the Ellipse in Washington to celebrate Hanukkah. It’s a recent tradition. Every year, President Obama lights the eight candles on the Menorah, then Joe Biden makes a wish and blows them out. \nThe National Highway Transportation and Safety Board warned that one-fourth of all holiday car accidents are caused by drinking and driving. Don’t these bureaucrats watch the news? You don’t really need a reason to drink, but it’s nice to know there are now plenty of good ones \navailable.",

      "title": "Starbucks' Schultz to Step Down: Will the Stock Lose Strength?",
      "text": "Trades from $ 3 Shares of coffee chain giant Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX - Free Report ) fell over 3% in afterhours trading on Dec 1, following the announcement that Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Howard Schultz, will step down from his post effective Apr 3, 2017.Notably, Kevin Johnson – the current President and Chief Operating Officer – who served as a board member of the company for several years before joining its executive team two years ago will take over as CEO.Meanwhile, Schultz will assume the role of executive chairman, shifting his focus to innovation, design and expansion of the high-end Starbucks Reserve Roastery concept globally. \nSTARBUCKS CORP Price \nSTARBUCKS CORP Price | STARBUCKS CORP Quote What’s the Fuss About? Interestingly, this is not the first time Schultz has taken a hiatus from the CEO position. Post a 13-year stint with the company, Schultz had stepped down in 2000 in order to focus on the company’s global strategy.However, the company clearly struggled in his absence with the stock plummeting and comps declining and thus Schultz had to return in 2008 to rescue the ailing stock.In fact, he played a major role in turning around the company’s fortunes by overseeing the expansion of the chain's food and beverage offerings and the growth of its popular loyalty program and mobile app.Going by the company’s performance the last time he left and the impact he has had on the company’s growth story, investors’ concerns about the change are quite obvious. Rationale Behind & Plans Ahead Starbucks’s move toward high-end coffee is intended at refreshing its brand, which has been facing escalating competition from specialty roasters such as Stumptown and Intelligentsia, as well as from mass coffee suppliers like Dunkin' Brands Group, Inc.’s ( DNKN - Free Report ) Dunkin’ Donuts, which has been launching more high-end drinks such as cold-brewed coffee.Schultz also aims to entice people who are increasingly shopping online to leave their homes by providing a deluxe experience via high-end coffee shops, thereby bolstering traffic.In Dec 2014, the company opened its first such store, the Seattle Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, a 15,000-square-foot store where coffee is roasted and customers can purchase $12 cups of small-batch reserve coffees made with a siphon brewing technique.The massive sales performance of the company’s first such shop has in part encouraged Schultz in believing that the new concept can bring growth to the company.Starbucks is thus planning to open 20 to 30 more of the high-end stores in prominent cities around the world. The company also plans to build up to 1,000 smaller stores reminiscent of the Roastery, under the \"Starbucks Reserve\" brand, barring the on-site roasting.Starbucks is also remodeling several of its over 24,000 stores with Reserve-branded coffee bars where customers can get the same kind of coffee education and range of brewing methods as at the Reserve stores.Interestingly, Schultz believes that the move to open high-end coffee shops marks the company's biggest strategic initiative since Starbucks began opening stores overseas 20 years ago. Our Take Though Schultz is pretty confident of the growth prospects of its new high-end coffee shops concept, a challenging environment in the U.S. restaurant space may actually draw few customers and in fact add to the company’s costs for building these new stores.We note that Starbuck’s shares have been outperforming the broader Zacks categorized Retail-Food & Restaurant Market over the past six months. While the stock has gained over 7%, the broader market had witnessed a gain of mere 1% in the same time period. Though Starbucks continues to outperform the broader market, its growth has slowed more recently and traffic trends have remained soft of late.Thus, with the news of Schultz’s departure coming at a critical juncture, it remains to be seen whether investors would still be keen on Starbucks shares sans Schultz or will history repeat itself. Zacks Rank & Stocks to Consider Starbucks currently has a Zacks Rank #3 ((Hold). Better-ranked stocks in this sector include McDonald's Corp. ( MCD - Free Report ) and Papa John’s International, Inc. ( PZZA - Free Report ) . Both the stocks carry a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.The Zacks Consensus Estimate for McDonald's full-year 2016 earnings climbed 2.3% over the last 60 days. The company’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 6.16%.Papa John’s earnings surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in each of the last four quarters, with an average beat of 11.31%. Further, for 2016, earnings per share are expected to grow 19.9%.

      "text": "Send Message Summary \nHoward Schultz has proven to be one of the most successful CEOs in history, nearly tripling the market's returns over the past two decades. \nNow, however, comes word that Schultz is stepping down as CEO in April; news that sent shares down 4% at one point. \nIn reality, Schultz's retirement from the top spot at his company does NOT represent a major risk to the company's growth thesis. \nUnlike the last time he walked away from Starbucks, Schultz will remain heavily involved with the company and continue to be its visionary leader. \nIncoming CEO, Kevin Johnson, has proven himself a master of global business growth and execution, and should be more than capable of growing Starbucks decades into the future. Click to enlarge Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX ) has been one of the most successful long-term investments in history, having made countless investors exceedingly wealthy over the past two decades. SBUX Total Return Price data by YCharts A big part of that has been the visionary management provided by founder and CEO Howard Schultz, who has proven to be a master at both capital allocation and strong and consistent growth execution since his triumphant return to Starbucks in 2008. SBUX Total Return Price data by YCharts Which means it is understandable that many Starbucks shareholders dreaded the inevitable day that Schultz would once more step down as CEO, which he has just announced will occur on April 3rd, 2017. However, while fear, uncertainty and doubt are all natural parts of any executive transition, there are three main reasons for long-term Starbucks investors to continue to not just hold onto their shares, but use any short-term post resignation news selloff as a great chance to add even more shares of what is likely to prove one of America's greatest future dividend growth machines. This is why people are scared Let's address the 800 lb gorilla in the room shall we? The last time Howard Schultz stepped down as CEO (and remained on as Chairman of the Board), the company ended up going off the rails. Specifically, Jim Donald, who was CEO during Schultz's last retirement from the top job, \"watered down the brand\" according to a 2007 memo from Schultz. This allowed key rivals such as McDonald's (NYSE: MCD ) to make strong inroads into the premium coffee market and steal market share. In addition, by losing focus on the company's core mission , i.e. a great, cozy experience for customers in what they can think of as their local coffee shop, the brand equity of Starbucks also fell, as hipsters in social media began to make fun of the brand. Worse yet, inefficiencies and waste began to creep into the company at all levels. These are the two things that Schultz immediately addressed upon his return, both with a mega-retreat with 10,000 store managers to New Orleans where 54,000 hours of community service helped remind people of the corporate culture, as well as $581 million in cost cuts that Schultz initiated upon retaking the CEO role. This laser-like focus on a solid corporate culture, with strong focus on customer experiences at its heart, as well as industry leading efficiencies and economy of scale, has become the hallmark of Starbucks since Schultz's return. Here is the reality Like last time, Schultz will remain as executive chairman of the board; however, he has vowed to take a more hands-on approach this time around. Specifically, he will be focus on the new super premium Roasteries concept, which promises to help keep the company focused on its premium image. That should ensure that the brand (the 45th most valuable in the world in 2016) doesn't lose its cache and premium pricing power. Meanwhile, Kevin Johnson, who has served as a director of the company for seven years and COO for the past two, will take over the top spot and focus on expanding Starbucks internationally, following the plan Schultz has laid out over the previous years . Schultz has said he has full faith in Johnson and I can see why. Johnson has a great resume at top tech firms such as Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT ) (where he spent 16 years), as well as CEO of Juniper Networks (NYSE: JNPR ) for five years. That expertise in the tech industry will be important as Starbucks continues to work hard to keep its app based loyalty program competitive with its rivals. Starbucks' best days still lay ahead Much like the President of the United States, investors tend to give the CEO too much credit for the overall operations, both good and bad, of a company. Now that's not to say that the CEO role isn't important, because it most certainly is. However, I'd like to point out that over the past two years, as Starbucks has continued to fire on all cylinders in the growth department, that success hasn't been just due to Schultz's hand at the tiller. Sure, Schultz provided the overall vision, but Johnson as COO was responsible for \"core support functions of Starbucks' supply chain, marketing, human resources, technology, and mobile, and digital platforms\". And we can't forget other key members of Starbucks' top notch exec team, which has a very deep bench. For example, chief strategy officer Matt Ryan, retail heads Cliff Burrows and John Culver, CFO Scott Maw, and channel development head Michael Conway were also instrumental to the success of Starbucks in recent years. In other words, the stepping down of Howard Schultz isn't nearly as much of a change as some investors fear. Heck, even Wall Street analysts from RBC Capital to Wells Fargo to Seeking Alpha's own Josh Arnold have pointed out that this news isn't the swan song for Starbucks' growth efforts. Rather, it's merely the next stage in the evolution of a company whose best days almost certainly still lie ahead of it. Risks to watch out for To tell you the truth, the thing that worries me far more than Schultz stepping down is the prospect for a strong dollar to undermine the company's overseas expansion efforts. That's primarily because, thanks to the market pricing in the likely Trump stimulus package of tax cuts and infrastructure spending, as well as slow but steady Federal Reserve rate hikes in 2017; long-term US interest rates have risen about 60 basis points since November 8th. Since Japanese, British, and European bond yields are still at or near zero, this means that demand from foreign investors for high-quality, riskless assets is likely to keep the dollar rising. That could mean ever greater currency headwinds in key growth markets such as China, where Starbucks is planning on doubling its store count in the next five years. Now, don't get me wrong, this risk, though important to keep in mind, doesn't mean that Starbucks isn't a buy at this point, or should the Shultz retirement news send shares even cheaper. Just keep in mind that currency headwinds might be an important component of future growth \"misses\" that short-term Wall Street is so fond of freaking out about and overreacting to. Bottom line: This news doesn't change Starbucks' long-term investment thesis, so keep buying the dips and hold until you get rich. Any time a legendary CEO steps down investors are understandably nervous that a hot growth stock will lose its mojo. However, having followed Schultz's career for several years, I believe that he and Starbucks have learned from the past mistakes they made. That's why I remain confident that Starbucks remains bound for continued glory in the years to come. Which is why, as a dividend growth investor, and a happy owner of Starbucks, I plan to not just keep my shares but continue to add on any dips that this none news may present. Given the growth runway ahead of it, I recommend that all long-term dividend growth investors do the same. Disclosure: I am/we are long SBUX, MSFT.

      "text": "By Carly Darrah Updated September 01, 2015 . \nIt's true that nowadays there's a Starbucks on every corner - and for those needing utility coffee, that may be just fine. Kansas Citians know that our city has a lot to offer in the way of a good cup of joe, and each local shop offers a little something different. Check out the list below for the best independent lattes in the land! 1. The Roasterie \nThis coffee company with the distinctive airplane logo has been around since 1993 and offers some of the finest coffee in KC. The company roasts its own beans (you may have seen the plant in the Crossroads - it's the one with the big airplane on top) and serves not only several different blends in store, but often provides exclusive blends to local area restaurants. What's the difference between them all? Learn about Cupping to tell roasts apart on a complimentary tour of the plant. \nThe main location is in Brookside, but there is a cafe at the factory and one in Leawood. More » \ncontinue reading below our video Beware! The 5 Most Common Travel Scams 2. Coffee Girls \nJust a little further down the road is a place where a frappuccino isn't the blended beverage people are after! At Coffee Girls, freshly squeezed juices and smoothies complement the full espresso bar, along with delicious locally-baked goodies. Located a block west of 75th and Wornall in the heart of Waldo, the shop is an easy walk from the many bars and other nightlife that may have you wanting a strong java beverage! More » 3. Broadway Roasting Company & Cafe \nSince 1992, Broadway's cafe and roasting plant have been staples of the Westport neighborhood. Customers of the cafe can pick up a drink seven days of the week, then head north just one block to see the big drum roaster used to create some of the finest beans around. More » 4. Filling Station Coffee Co. \nWhat's a person to do with an old, abandoned gas station? Why, turn it into a coffee garage, of course! Stop by and fill up (get it?) on coffee in this unique shop in the heart of Union Hill. With limited seating, this place is often packed to the brim with travelers wanting a top-off on their way to work. If staying in the car is more your style, visit their drive-through filling station about 10 blocks south in Westport! 5. The Quay Coffee (and Oddly Correct) \nIf you're closer to the river side, check out this gem nestled in the River Market , a neighborhood that bore the name \"The Quay\" in the 70s and 80s. In a great example of local businesses supporting one another, the Quay brews beans from another local roaster/cafe, the delightfully-named Oddly Correct . The menu at the Quay is simple, and it's because the product is top-notch. No extra syrups or fluffy fillers here! More »",

      "title": "How Starbucks Can Guarantee Its CEO Transition Succeeds",
      "text": "A company’s CEO is often the face of the brand. In the case of Howard Schultz, his mild countenance has become synonymous with the coffee company’s twin-tailed Siren that signals the presence of more than 25,000 shops in 75 countries.\nNow, that face is planning to step aside. that Schultz is transitioning to take the position of executive chairman while he works on expanding the company’s premium brand. Schultz \"personally selected\" Starbucks’ current president and COO Kevin Johnson to take the helm, which will happen on April 3, 2017.\nJohnson, who the New York Times reported is a close friend of Schultz&apos;s, has been on the company&apos;s board of directors for seven years and on its executive management team since 2015. Yet Johnson has some big shoes to fill. Not only has Schultz presided over the expansion of the largest coffee business in the world, but he’s also never shied away from the company’s social responsibility or the care of its staff—which is why we pronounced him among the best leaders of 2015 .\nConfidence Must Come From The Top Schultz is confident of Johnson’s abilities, saying he’s \"better equipped\" to \"run the company than I am,\" in the Times interview.\nThe nod to Johnson’s operational talents sends an important message, because the way a company manages such a major transition significantly impacts its financial performance, according to leadership consultancy DDI. Starbucks’ solid financial performance—it has consistently outperformed the S&P as well as other brands in food retail—hangs in the balance.\nDave Ulrich, a professor at the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Business, explained the pressure a new leader faces in a previous Fast Company article . He said:\nTo help weather [transitions], executives need strong track records of delivering measurable results amid uncertainty. At times when doubts run high, a CEO should reassure everyone watching that he or she has a plan that will pull through.\nPracticing The Work The good news is that Johnson has already taken over Starbucks’ day-to-day operations—a change the the company made this past summer—allowing for the two executives to overlap responsibilities. A DDI study of leadership in transition indicates that among over 600 professionals surveyed, close to half (42%) said they wanted a more structured development plan along with mentorship.\nAn essential part of a succession plan is this type of handoff, according to Patty Azzarello , CEO and business adviser at Azzarello Group. \"You need to give them opportunities to practice the ugly, mind-numbing, controversial, boring, unsupported, failing, no-win kind of work you deal with every day when you wake up,\" she wrote in Fast Company . The reason this is crucial, Azzarello said, is \"they get to suffer like you do. But they get to work on big stuff. They get access to your network and stakeholders. They have the chance to do something creative and heroic to get this done.\"\nIt remains to be seen how much Schultz will manage alongside Johnson. DDI found that many times a \"former manager disengages, and the new manager—with a backlog of projects—fails to appreciate the challenges faced by the leader-in-transition.\"\nAcknowledge The Change, Set Expectations Beth Bechky, who teaches courses in managing high-performance teams at New York University’s Stern School of Business, told Fast Company in a previous interview that when someone’s role is elevated, it’s easy for the team to assume nothing has actually changed. She recommends that leaders in transition acknowledge the changes and clearly communicate how expectations may be shifting.\nMaking Decisions And Being Authentic Part of the shift in expectations could be realized through a new style of decision making. Advises Azzarello, \"Think about the next few months of decisions you need to make. Investments, priorities, partnerships, roadmap choices, marketing strategies. Give your top performer the task of owning the project and making the decisions.\"\nEmpathy And Authenticity What may work in Johnson’s favor is his early display of vulnerability and authenticity, traits that translate to business success , according to DDI.\nIn the New York Times interview, Johnson acknowledged that he came back to the corporate world after a bout of skin cancer, convinced that Starbucks would give him the opportunity to do something meaningful. He also acknowledged his own self-doubt about the new role, but he carefully deferred to the company’s beloved chief. \"I’m not going to try to be Howard,\" Johnson said. \"We are two different people.\"\nSuch emotional intelligence and display of character bodes well for the future of the new CEO of Starbucks. According to KRW International , a leadership consultancy, CEOs whose characters were highly rated by employees had an average return on assets of 9.35% over a two-year period, almost five times as much as CEOs with low scores whose return on assets averaged just 1.93%.",

      "text": "\nQUOTE OF THE DAY \n“I can’t try to be Howard. I’m not Howard” — Newly-appointed Starbucks CEO Kevin Johnson , as he replaces ex-CEO Howard Schultz. Let’s see if Kevin can add his own flavor to the world’s most iconic Brew (next to us, of course). \nMarket Snapshot · U.S. stocks finished mixed on Friday , but it was the first weekly decline for markets since the U.S. election, with technology stocks a particular drag\n· The euro dropped to 20-month lows after exit polls in Italy indicated an overwhelming majority of voters rejected Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum to streamline parliament, a proposal he vowed to resign over if it wasn’t passed (spoiler alert: the referendum was soundly rejected yesterday, and Renzi promptly resigned)\nAirbnb Breathes a Sigh of Relief …After making up with New York City. In October, our beloved Airbnb filed a lawsuit against the Big Apple. The reason: if an NYC host illegally advertised on Airbnb, it wasn’t just the host who could be financially penalized—Airbnb would be too. What do we mean by “illegally advertising?” One example Airbnb hosts can’t rent out multiple units in a home, aka basically running an illegal mini-hotel ( yes, this happens ). Worry no longer: NYC has clarified that the law is aimed at individuals, and Airbnb won’t be fined for any host transgressions—crisis averted, and cue Airbnb dropping its lawsuit. That’s a big bullet dodged for a high-profile market worth $1 billion in revenues for Airbnb. Of course, this lawsuit is just one of many regulatory challenges facing Airbnb, so this likely won’t be its last tango with the law.\nApple Fesses Up …Finally. In a letter to auto regulators, Apple’s (+0.37%) Director of Product Integrity (yes, that’s a thing), Steve Kenner , emphasized the tech giant’s prospective investment in machine learning and autonomous transportation. Let’s translate that to English: Apple all but confirmed it’s more interested in self-driving car tech (i.e. the software inside) than self-driving cars themselves (i.e. the hardware). We’ve known for a while about the not-so-secretive Project Titan (because ‘Project T-Rex’ was already taken), aka Apple’s internal self-driving car division. But a Bloomberg investigation in October claimed that internal strife had already caused the tech giant to narrow its focus from creating its own self-driving car to just developing the software. Regardless, there’s still a long ways to go. Regulatory hurdles and data-sharing disputes aren’t making autonomous driving a very easy market to enter. At least Apple hasn’t totally given up.\nPandora’s Box …Going once, going twice, sold? Well, not quite yet, but the second time might be the charm. Pandora (+16.11%) is now reportedly interested in selling itself, specifically to SiriusXM (-5.60%). The struggling music streaming service had initially declined a $15/share offer by Liberty Media (the owner of Sirius), hoping to get a better price. But after Pandora’s stock tanked below $10 and pressure from activist investors increased, $15 ain’t looking so bad after all. Liberty CEO Greg Maffei has been vocal about his belief in the “free space,” whether it be traditional radio or online (Pandora), versus paid players like Spotify and Apple Music. Seems like he’s about ready to put his money where his mouth is.\nAll That Glitters Isn’t Gold …Just take a look at the jobs market. Over the weekend, unemployment figures dropped from the heavens, and they looked good from the outside—the headline unemployment rate fell a bunch to 4.6% and 178,000 jobs were added in November. Not bad, right? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Despite the unemployment rate hitting a nine-year low, wages and the broader labor participation rate both ticked down, leaving analysts with mixed feelings. Don’t worry too much though, that interest rate hike you’ve been waiting for all these months is still looking pretty likely before 2016 is up.\nOther Stories · Deutsche Bank cuts ties with 3,400 clients in trading business\n· Facebook to invest $20 million in local housing as Silicon Valley faces crisis\n· United to pay $2.4 million over ‘Chairman’s Flight’\n· Venezuela to issue bigger bills this month as currency plunges\nEconomic Calendar · Monday: ISM Non-Manufacturing Index\n· Tuesday: Bank of Montreal, Dave & Buster’s Earnings; International Trade\n· Wednesday: Costco, Lululemon, H&R Block Earnings; Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey\n· Thursday: Broadcom Earnings; Weekly Jobless Claims\n· Friday: Consumer Sentiment\nThe New Kid on the Block On September 19, the real estate sector became the newest member of the S&P 500. How’d it fare during its rookie season? See for yourself: of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, the real estate sector, made up of real estate investment trusts (REITS) and management companies, has been the worst performing . Yikes. Let’s run through the numbers:\n· Since its debut less than three months ago, the real estate sector is down 7.9%. In the same time frame, the S&P 500 is up 2.5%. Talk about not carrying your weight.\n· Which charitable sectors picked up real estate’s slack? Good ol’ financials and energy have advanced 17% and 10%, respectively, since real estate hit the scene.\n· These are strange times indeed. According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, this is pretty out of the ordinary. From 2000 through the first half of 2016, REITs have yielded an annual average return of 12%.\n· So why the sudden decline? Just like Brexit was the answer to most questions this summer, the frequent answer now is Trump. Since the election, and specifically renewed expectations of higher growth (due to less regulation and taxes), investors view high dividend stocks like REITs as less attractive.\nInterview Question of the Day How do I value the shares that I own in a private company? ( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day After stepping down as CEO of Zenefits on Friday, David Sacks appears to be joining his long-time friend Peter Thiel on Donald Trump’s transition team. You may not have heard of him, but Sacks keeps good company: he was an early executive at PayPal along with Elon Musk and Thiel. On to the next one.\nFood for Thought The early bird catches the worm. Like Richard Branson and Jack Dorsey, many billionaires seem to fully embrace the idea of waking up before the crack of dawn. Why? It’s often claimed that the morning is the most productive time of the day because there are little to no distractions. Here at the Brew Crew, on the other hand, we’re most definitely night owls.\nThis embed is invalid\nShare This\n",

Let’s see if Kevin can add his own flavor to the world’s most iconic Brew (next to us, of course). \nMarket Snapshot · U.S. stocks finished mixed on Friday , but it was the first weekly decline for markets since the U.S. election, with technology stocks a particular drag\n· The euro dropped to 20-month lows after exit polls in Italy indicated an overwhelming majority of voters rejected Prime Minister Matteo Renzi’s referendum to streamline parliament, a proposal he vowed to resign over if it wasn’t passed (spoiler alert: the referendum was soundly rejected yesterday, and Renzi promptly resigned)\nAirbnb Breathes a Sigh of Relief …After making up with New York City. In October, our beloved Airbnb filed a lawsuit against the Big Apple. The reason: if an NYC host illegally advertised on Airbnb, it wasn’t just the host who could be financially penalized—Airbnb would be too. What do we mean by “illegally advertising?” One example Airbnb hosts can’t rent out multiple units in a home, aka basically running an illegal mini-hotel ( yes, this happens ). Worry no longer: NYC has clarified that the law is aimed at individuals, and Airbnb won’t be fined for any host transgressions—crisis averted, and cue Airbnb dropping its lawsuit. That’s a big bullet dodged for a high-profile market worth $1 billion in revenues for Airbnb. Of course, this lawsuit is just one of many regulatory challenges facing Airbnb, so this likely won’t be its last tango with the law.\nApple Fesses Up …Finally. In a letter to auto regulators, Apple’s (+0.37%) Director of Product Integrity (yes, that’s a thing), Steve Kenner , emphasized the tech giant’s prospective investment in machine learning and autonomous transportation. Let’s translate that to English: Apple all but confirmed it’s more interested in self-driving car tech (i.e. the software inside) than self-driving cars themselves (i.e. the hardware). We’ve known for a while about the not-so-secretive Project Titan (because ‘Project T-Rex’ was already taken), aka Apple’s internal self-driving car division. But a Bloomberg investigation in October claimed that internal strife had already caused the tech giant to narrow its focus from creating its own self-driving car to just developing the software. Regardless, there’s still a long ways to go. Regulatory hurdles and data-sharing disputes aren’t making autonomous driving a very easy market to enter. At least Apple hasn’t totally given up.\nPandora’s Box …Going once, going twice, sold? Well, not quite yet, but the second time might be the charm. Pandora (+16.11%) is now reportedly interested in selling itself, specifically to SiriusXM (-5.60%). The struggling music streaming service had initially declined a $15/share offer by Liberty Media (the owner of Sirius), hoping to get a better price. But after Pandora’s stock tanked below $10 and pressure from activist investors increased, $15 ain’t looking so bad after all. Liberty CEO Greg Maffei has been vocal about his belief in the “free space,” whether it be traditional radio or online (Pandora), versus paid players like Spotify and Apple Music. Seems like he’s about ready to put his money where his mouth is.\nAll That Glitters Isn’t Gold …Just take a look at the jobs market. Over the weekend, unemployment figures dropped from the heavens, and they looked good from the outside—the headline unemployment rate fell a bunch to 4.6% and 178,000 jobs were added in November. Not bad, right? Unfortunately, it’s not that simple. Despite the unemployment rate hitting a nine-year low, wages and the broader labor participation rate both ticked down, leaving analysts with mixed feelings. Don’t worry too much though, that interest rate hike you’ve been waiting for all these months is still looking pretty likely before 2016 is up.\nOther Stories · Deutsche Bank cuts ties with 3,400 clients in trading business\n· Facebook to invest $20 million in local housing as Silicon Valley faces crisis\n· United to pay $2.4 million over ‘Chairman’s Flight’\n· Venezuela to issue bigger bills this month as currency plunges\nEconomic Calendar · Monday: ISM Non-Manufacturing Index\n· Tuesday: Bank of Montreal, Dave & Buster’s Earnings; International Trade\n· Wednesday: Costco, Lululemon, H&R Block Earnings; Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey\n· Thursday: Broadcom Earnings; Weekly Jobless Claims\n· Friday: Consumer Sentiment\nThe New Kid on the Block On September 19, the real estate sector became the newest member of the S&P 500. How’d it fare during its rookie season? See for yourself: of the 11 sectors in the S&P 500, the real estate sector, made up of real estate investment trusts (REITS) and management companies, has been the worst performing . Yikes. Let’s run through the numbers:\n· Since its debut less than three months ago, the real estate sector is down 7.9%. In the same time frame, the S&P 500 is up 2.5%. Talk about not carrying your weight.\n· Which charitable sectors picked up real estate’s slack? Good ol’ financials and energy have advanced 17% and 10%, respectively, since real estate hit the scene.\n· These are strange times indeed. According to J.P. Morgan Asset Management, this is pretty out of the ordinary. From 2000 through the first half of 2016, REITs have yielded an annual average return of 12%.\n· So why the sudden decline? Just like Brexit was the answer to most questions this summer, the frequent answer now is Trump. Since the election, and specifically renewed expectations of higher growth (due to less regulation and taxes), investors view high dividend stocks like REITs as less attractive.\nInterview Question of the Day How do I value the shares that I own in a private company? ( Answer )\nBusiness Person of the Day After stepping down as CEO of Zenefits on Friday, David Sacks appears to be joining his long-time friend Peter Thiel on Donald Trump’s transition team. You may not have heard of him, but Sacks keeps good company: he was an early executive at PayPal along with Elon Musk and Thiel. On to the next one.\nFood for Thought The early bird catches the worm. Like Richard Branson and Jack Dorsey, many billionaires seem to fully embrace the idea of waking up before the crack of dawn. Why? It’s often claimed that the morning is the most productive time of the day because there are little to no distractions. Here at the Brew Crew, on the other hand, we’re most definitely night owls.\n\n",

      "text": "The twinkling lights. The Starbucks cups. The fa-la-la-la-laing.\nAll of those things are fine for getting into the seasonal spirit. But it’s not really the holidays until you read an article about avoiding weight gain. In the December issue of Women’s Health, Paige Fowler offers this new twist on the usual advice: Eat like an animal.\nHer theory is that “birds and beasts spend three-quarters of their waking lives acquiring and consuming food — but never get fat. Sooo, who better to go to for diet advice?”\nNo actual animals appear to have been consulted in the reporting of this story. Instead, Fowler focuses on a few habits of five creatures and then suggests how humans might ape them (although it’s monkeys, not apes, that are included in this list).\nIn most cases, the goal is to glean a lesson from each animal, not to behave exactly like them.\nPenguins, for instance, are lauded because they “take a break from food.” Their month-long fasts become inspiration for holding off on late-night snacking.\nCows, which “gulp more than 2,000 ounces of H2O daily,” are smart about staying hydrated. If you do the same, you won’t confuse thirst for hunger.\nAnd those monkeys like to grab whatever fruit they find nearby. The lesson for humans: Keep a fruit bowl in a prominent spot, and always stock your fridge with fresh-cut veggies.\nAs you hit the party circuit, consider the sheep that wore your woolen sweater before you did. She probably chewed and chewed and chewed each bite of her meals, a trick that can make you feel more satisfied.\nAnd if you find yourself leaving a buffet feeling like a whale? Try to act more like one next time. They “don’t fear fat,” Fowler notes. By eating food with normal levels of fat, you can feel fuller — and better able to resist all of those sugary, carb-laden cookies.\n",

      "text": "Outgoing Starbucks (NASDAQ: SBUX) CEO Howard Schultz loves coffee and his leadership changed how Americans consume it.\nHe took what was once just a coffee roaster and turned it into his own vision of an Italian coffee bar. Schultz, who has said he drinks about five cups of his company's signature beverage each day, changed the coffee house to a \"third place\" between work and home, while introducing many Americans to espresso-based beverages. \nThe coffee chain's longtime CEO has been accused of numerous crimes against coffee with many enthusiasts decrying that he created the \"half caf, light foam, soy milk, vanilla latte\" crowd. Schultz, who has also been castigated by purists for inventing the Frappuccino, sees things differently: Instead of diluting the coffee-drinking experience, he has brought it to the masses.\nContinue reading ",

      "text": "Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer {{following ? \"Following\" : \"Follow\"}} December 05, 2016 2:39pm Comments Share: \nA new star has risen to prominence on Starbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX )'s horizon and those who have seen it (rather him) emerge from under the shadows of the company's celebrated founder Howard Schultz may be thirsting to know more about the new star. \nKevin Johnson, currently chief operating officer at the company, is set to take over the reins of the company on April 3, 2017. Analysts anticipate the transition to be smooth, as Johnson has been a board member for the past seven years and has been running the global business of the company alongside Schultz. \nBenzinga has profiled Johnson, the CEO-designate, for our readers: Appointed as president and COO of Starbucks in March 2015 after being a board member since 2009. In that capacity, he headed the company's global operating businesses, across the Americas, EMEA and China/Asia Pacific, as well as the company's supply chain, IT and mobile and digital platforms. Johnson took over from the then COO Troy Alstead, who wished to take a sabbatical to spend more time with family. Johnson was appointed CEO of Juniper Networks, Inc. (NYSE: JNPR ) in September 2008. The announcement of his retirement in July 2013 took everyone by surprise, as the company had thrived during his five-year tenure, capitalizing on huge spending by telecom companies. He officially relinquished the CEO position at Juniper in January 2014. Prior to that, Johnson was employed at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) for 18 years in varied capacities. When he left the software giant, Johnson was leading the platforms and services division, where he was responsible for Windows and online services businesses. Before that, he served as group vice president of Microsoft's worldwide sales, marketing and services and also oversaw corporate operations and IT functions that supported the work of Microsoft employees worldwide. A noteworthy development when Johnson was at Microsoft was its failed attempt to buy Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO ) way back in 2008. In a memo explaining the botched deal, Johnson, who was helming Windows Live, said the failure to reach an accord regarding the price by the end of the April deadline had led to the withdrawal of the offer. Johnson has also served in International Business Machines Corp. (NYSE: IBM ) systems integration and consulting business. Johnson And Starbucks \nJohnson, being a 30-year veteran in the technology industry, proved to be an asset for the coffee chain retailer in its pursuit of digital initiatives such as smartphone ordering and mobile coffee delivery. In a senior leadership announced in July this year with focus on its long-term strategy and innovation efforts, Johnson was assigned leadership of the Starbucks senior leadership team. This rejig followed the revenue miss in its second quarter. \nAt last check, Starbucks was up 1 percent to $57.78 after it dropped 2.22 percent on Friday on the announcement of the leadership transition. © 2016 Benzinga.com.

      "text": "Source: Thinkstock Ahead of its Investor Day on December 7, Starbucks Corporation (NYSE: SBUX) was given a review by Credit Suisse about quantifying the impact of “My Starbucks Rewards” on the Starbucks’ same store sales figures. Effectively, this is measuring the so-called “digital flywheel.”\nCredit Suisse pointed out that Starbucks has often pointed to the importance of the My Starbucks Rewards program as a same store sales driver. Still, their view is that Starbucks has never quantified the direct impact. This brokerage firm’s view suggest that membership growth in My Starbucks Rewards contributed about 310 basis points to same store sales in 2015 and about 240 basis points in 2016.\nThe long and short of the matter is that Credit Suisse believes that My Starbucks Rewards has accounted for approximately 40% of total U.S. same store sales each year. This was higher than what they expected, but it also looks like it is because My Starbucks Rewards members spend about three times more per year than those who are not My Starbucks Rewards members.\nCredit Suisse now believes that growing the member base is now key to Starbucks maintaining its same store sales momentum.\nWhat stands out about that stunning figures is that this creates a good news meets bad news scenario. The research report said:\nMy Starbucks Rewards membership growth has been slowing, which may help explain the recent deceleration in US comparable sales further deceleration in My Starbucks Rewards sign-ups would not bode well for same store sales trends. The good news: same store sales expectations have come down. If Starbucks can sustain the recent growth rate in My Starbucks Rewards membership, the company will be well on its way to at least meeting consensus forecasts (approximately around 5% US same store sales in Fiscal Year 2017 estimates)… we estimate that My Starbucks Rewards growth should add approximately 2%-plus to Fiscal Year 2017 if membership growth sustains in the mid-to-high teens.\nCredit Suisse has only a Neutral rating on Starbucks shares and they have just a $55.00 price target for the stock versus a current share price of $57.50. The firm remains concerned that, even with few other companies having strong sales drivers, that the steady deceleration in same store sales and EBIT growth in recent quarters. Monday’s report shows that the firm would prefer to see stabilization in this trend before becoming more bullish — and the firm does not expect this investor day to offer major new catalysts like what had been seen with the launch of mobile ordering and pay in 2014.\nOne more concern that was brought up was that consensus Fiscal Year 2017 forecasts imply an acceleration in EBIT growth to ~16%, from ~12% in Fiscal Year 2016 outside of the 53rd week. They see a challenging earnings bar being set for the year ahead due to slowing same store sales, rising coffee costs, slightly worse foreign exchange drag, and also from higher investment spending.\nI'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter \nterms and conditions   24/7 Wall St. addressed another concern last week on the announcement that Howard Schultz is retiring as CEO to focus on new initiatives. That concern — has Starbucks’ growth peaked??? ",

      "text": "How Starbucks' Howard Schultz went from humble beginnings to a $4 billion fortune Catherine Clifford CNBC Tuesday, Dec 06, 2016 Print \nHoward Schultz, the legendary leader of Starbucks coffee, is a billionaire three times over. He's a titan in the corporate world and he has significant sway in the political arena, too. When Schultz talks, Wall Street and Washington D.C. pay attention. \nThe news that he is stepping down as CEO reverberated through the business world, briefly sending shares of Starbucks stock down as much as 10 per cent. Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson will become CEO on April 3, 2017; Schultz will focus on turning the company's new line of high-end coffee shops into destination restaurants. \nWhen Schultz steps down in 2017, it will be the second time: He served as CEO from 1987 to 2000 and then returned to take the helm in 2008. \nThis time, despite Schultz's denials, the announcement has triggered rampant speculation that Schultz, who is a fan of President Barack Obama and publicly supported Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, is preparing for a run for president of the United States in 2020. \nIf he did run, it would be the culmination of Schultz's classic rags-to-riches story. \nHumble beginnings \nSchultz, 63 years old, was born in Brooklyn, New York, and grew up in federally subsidized housing in hardscrabble Canarsie. \nHis father Fred never graduated from high school and held a series of blue-collar jobs including truck driver, factory worker and cab driver. He never made more than $20,000 a year, and with three children to feed, Fred was never able to afford to buy a home. \nSchultz talks affectionately about his father in his book, \"Pour Your Heart Into It: How Starbucks Built a Company One Cup at a Time,\" saying that Fred was an honest man who worked hard, played ball with his kids on the weekend and loved the Yankees. \nBut he also says that his father was \"a beaten man.\" His father \"had tried to fit into the system, but the system had crushed him. With low self-esteem, he had never been able to climb out of the hole and improve his life.\" \nWhen his father broke his ankle at work in 1961, Fred couldn't go to work. That meant he didn't get paid. His mother was seven months pregnant at the time and couldn't work either. When bill collectors called, Schultz or his siblings were instructed to pick up the phone and pretend that their parents weren't home. \n\"Our family had no income, no health insurance, no worker's compensation, nothing to fall back on,\" writes Schultz. He didn't know then that he would become a businessman and job-creator, but, he says, \"I knew in my heart that if I was ever in a position where I could make a difference, I wouldn't leave people behind.\" \nSchultz went on to graduate from Northern Michigan University, which he attended on a full football scholarship. He became the first person to graduate college in his family. He writes, \"To my parents, I had attained the big prize: a diploma.\" \nBefore Starbucks, Schultz worked in sales and marketing at Xerox for three years. He went on to be the Vice President and General Manager of Hammarplast USA., a Swedish housewares company. \nRising through the ranks \nSchultz moved from New York to Seattle to join Starbucks in 1982 as director of operations and marketing. Back then, the company only had four stores. \nIn 1983, Schulz travelled to Italy, where he admired the way the espresso bars in Milan serve as a place for people to meet and share time together outside of the home or the office. He left Starbucks and started his own company, Il Giornale coffeehouses. \nIn 1987, Schultz returned to Starbucks to buy the coffee shop with the help of a few investors. He also took over as CEO. At that point, there were 17 store locations. Today, there are more than 25,000 Starbucks locations across 75 countries, and more than 300,000 people work at the coffee company. \nSchultz navigated the company through tremendous growth while remaining socially conscious. In 1988, Schultz made a commitment to offer health insurance to eligible full- and part-time workers, including all domestic partners of employees. Also, Schultz decided to give \"partners\" (his employees) stock in the company, called \"Bean stock.\" \nIn 2013, Schultz made a commitment to hire 10,000 veterans and military spouses by the end of 2018. He's hired more than 8,000 so far. \nAlso, Starbucks has shipped 60 pallets of coffee and 175,000 sticks of instant coffee to troops overseas. His own personal Schultz Family Foundation has committed US$30 million (S$42.6 million) to helping veterans transitioning into the civilian workforce. \nA leading voice \nSchultz is gracious in deflecting the spotlight. \n\"Starbucks has been in business now for 45-plus years. You know, I'm not putting myself in the class of Tom Brady or any other athlete that has been at the cornerstone of success on a team sport,\" Schultz tells CNBC. \"This is a team sport. It has always been a team sport. I've gotten more credit that I deserve. The company has a large base of fantastic leaders.\" \nStill, Schultz is largely seen as the smarts behind much of Starbucks' success and its evolution into a global brand. \nHe has accumulated a stack of awards, including the Distinguished Leadership Award from Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management, the Horatio Alger Award for those who have overcome adversity to achieve success, the Rev. Theodore M. Hesburgh Award for Business Ethics given by Notre Dame University's Mendoza College of Business, the Botwinick Prize in Business Ethics from Columbia Business School, and the first-ever John Wooden Global Leadership Award from UCLA Anderson School of Management. \nHe's also a best-selling author. After his first book was well-received, Schultz published \"For Love of Country: What Our Veterans Can Teach Us About Citizenship, Heroism, and Sacrifice\" (2014) and \"Onward: How Starbucks Fought for Its Life without Losing Its Soul\" (2011). \nSchultz's inspiring journey involves a bit of luck, he admits, but it has also been the result of a fierce determination and unwavering persistence. \n\"I willed it to happen,\" he says. \"I took my life in my hands, learned from anyone I could, grabbed what opportunity I could, and molded my success step by step.\" 37 things good bosses do Related Stories ",

      "text": "How McDonald's Revamped McCafe Could Beat Starbucks It's all about identifying the target customer. By Justin Bariso Justin Bariso is an author and the founder of Insight , a consultancy that helps organizations think differently and communicate with impact. In 2015, LinkedIn named Bariso one of its top three management writers of the year. His forthcoming book, EQ, Applied, shares fascinating research, modern examples, and personal stories that illustrate both high and low EQ--as demonstrated in the real world. Advertisement \nWe need to talk about McCafe. \nMcDonald's will reintroduce the coffee shop in 2017, in attempt to challenge Starbucks and Dunkin Donuts. \nVia Bloomberg: \n\"We're really excited about the McCafe brand and what it can do to complement our food offerings,\" Kristy Cunningham, U.S. senior vice president of strategy and insights, said in an interview. The new McCafe campaign will include special deals, more seasonal beverages and increased marketing of the chain's coffee rewards program, she said. \nSound familiar? \nThe world's largest fast-food chain is also raising its game by providing an equipment upgrade. The new espresso machines, which are more technologically advanced than the current ones, reportedly cost about $12,000 each. \nWith Starbucks C.E.O. Howard Schultz stepping down in April next year, the timing couldn't be better for McDonald's. McDonald's Advantage \nThere's no questioning Starbucks is the king of the coffee world right now, and the best McDonald's can hope for now is to cut a small slice of market share for itself. The company reportedly opened its first stand-alone McCafe in Toronto last year, so it will be interesting to see if it continues with that strategy. \nBut if you ask me, McDonald's should focus on one strategy above all others: \nMake McCafe nice. Sophisticated , even. \nBut also make it family-friendly. \nHere's why I say that: \nThere's a McDonalds my family and I have been to that's a little more upscale than your typical fast-food chain. (Yes, it houses a McCafe as well.) \nAs my wife and I recently enjoyed what I considered a good cappuccino, we couldn't help but notice the comfortable, plush leather seats. The décor and lighting were also very contemporary, and the music was pleasant. At one point, we looked at each other and asked the same thing: \"Is this really a McDonald's?\" \nBut the best part was that our two young children weren't bored. There was plenty to do, with multiple video game stations and a large \"Play Place\" outside. My kids were overjoyed to get their happy meals, after which they went off for a little fun. And my wife and I were able to enjoy a cup of coffee and decent conversation, while keeping an eye on the kids. (No easy task with children the age of ours.) \nI've never seen another McDonald's/McCafe combination like this one, so I'm assuming it's an individual franchise operator who decided to go above and beyond. But if McDonald's is smart, they'll start building more. \nBecause it ain't the hipsters and coffee connoisseurs they're going to win over. \nIt's the friends with kids. Like this column?

      "text": "Starbucks ( SBUX ) is holding its investor day on Wednesday. Last week, long-time CEO Howard Schultz announced he is stepping down in April of 2017 and will be replaced by Chief Operating Officer Kevin Johnson. Schultz will focus his efforts on helping the company open upscale coffee shops. The investor day is held in New York and starts at 8 a.m. EDT. In addition to Schultz and Johnson, Chief Financial Officer Scott Maw will be part of the presentation. Investors will be looking for commentary on the transition of power, along with the company's growth prospects for China. Earlier this year, Schultz said the company would open 500 stores a year in China over the next five years. Starbucks shares are down over 4% since the start of 2016.

Seattle Reserve Roastery that opened in 2014. Starbucks aims to open at least 20 Roasteries around the world including sites in Shanghai (2017), NYC (2018), Tokyo (2018) and Europe (2019). The Roastery concept will lend coffee-forward insights to the 4 existing Reserve Stores in NYC (3) and Lake Forest, IL and the eventual 1,000 stores globally. The Reserve Store format will offer artisanal Princi items and an espresso bar within\nthe 3,500-4,000 s.f. footprint. Management anticipates Reserve stores will deliver twice the unit economics of a typical location through an elevated experience. Finally, management stated the possibility for Reserve bars in 20% or more of the system over the LT.\nShares of Starbucks have declined 0.4% to $57.29 at 11:46 a.m. today.",

      "text": "Starbucks Corporation ( SBUX - Free Report ) , a leading coffee chain, was down 3.3% in after-market trading after it announced that CEO, Howard Schultz will step down from his position. Schultz will be succeeded by Kevin Johnson, the company’s current president and chief operating officer. The move will be effective from April 3, 2017.\n\nThe visionary leader of Starbucks steadily built the world’s largest coffee business, which now has more than 25,000 stores in 75 countries. The decision did not go down well with investors. It reminds one of April 6, 2000 when Schultz left the reins of Starbucks to focus on the company’s global strategy. At that time, the company’s shares fell a whopping 28% in a period of seven weeks. Amid challenges posed by the 2008 financial crisis, Schultz returned to the helm.\n\nHowever, the fundamental strength of the company still remains strong. In the fiscal fourth quarter, not only did the company report better-than-expected earnings but also hiked its dividend by 25% to 25 cents a share. For fiscal 2017, Starbucks expects earnings per share to be in the range of $2.12 to $2.14 compared with the current Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.13. The company expects consolidated revenues to grow in double digits and targets opening 2,100 net new stores globally. Comparable store sales are expected to grow in mid-single digits (read: ETFs to Watch on Starbucks' Upbeat Q4 Results ).\n\nThe increasing use of Mobile Order and Pay could prove to be a key growth driver in the upcoming quarters. Additionally, factors including cheap fuel, better job prospects and increasing consumer confidence are likely to play an important role in boosting the restaurant industry, to which Starbucks belongs. Meanwhile, the president-elect has spread optimism in the economy and promised to accelerate growth, spend big time on infrastructure, reduce regulations, cut taxes and create more jobs in the country (read: 4 Reasons to Buy Retail ETFs This Holiday Season ).\n\nIn this scenario, we have highlighted three consumer discretionary ETFs with a solid Zacks ETF Rank and a good exposure to Starbucks that are expected to remain on investors’ radar.\n\nConsumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund ( XLY - Free Report ) \n\nThis product offers exposure to the broad consumer discretionary space by tracking the Consumer Discretionary Select Sector Index. It is the largest and the most popular product in this space with AUM of nearly $10.9 billion and average daily volume of around 5.4 million shares. Holding 88 securities in its basket, Starbucks occupies the sixth position in the fund with 3.6% allocation. Media dominates about one-fourth of the portfolio while Internet and direct marketing retail, specialty retail, and hotels restaurants and leisure round off the next three spots with a double-digit allocation each. The fund charges 0.14% in expense ratio and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 or ‘Strong Buy’ rating (read: Trump Effect Elevated These Sector ETFs to Rank #1 ).\n\niShares U.S. Consumer Services ETF ( IYC - Free Report ) \n\nThis ETF provides targeted exposure to domestic consumer services stocks by tracking the Dow Jones U.S. Consumer Services Index. It holds 184 stocks in its basket with Starbucks occupying the seventh position in the fund with 2.9% allocation. In terms of industrial exposure, retailing makes up the largest share with 37.8%, followed by media (23.4%), consumer services (15.5%), and foods & staples retailing (14%). The fund has amassed $837.9 million in its asset base and trades in a small volume of 39,000 shares a day on an average. It charges 44 bps in annual fees from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 3 or ‘Hold’ rating.\n\nFidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF ( FDIS - Free Report ) \n\nThis fund tracks the MSCI USA IMI Consumer Discretionary Index, holding 377 stocks in its basket. Out of these, SBUX takes the sixth spot with 2.9% share. Media makes up for the top sector with 24% share, followed by specialty retail (19%), internet & direct marketing retail (15.9%), and hotels restaurants & leisure (15.8%). The product has amassed $227.6 million in its asset base and trades in a good volume of around 86,000 shares a day on average. It charges 0.084% in annual fees from investors and has a Zacks ETF Rank of 1 (read: A Spread of Top-Ranked ETFs for Thanksgiving and After ).\n\nWant key ETF info delivered straight to your inbox? \n\nZacks’ free Fund Newsletter will brief you on top news and analysis, as well as top-performing ETFs, each week.

      "text": "Starbucks co-founder Howard Schultz’s plan to build a new prestige brand is a bet that moving upscale can raise the profile of the world’s largest coffee brand with millennials like Megan Sauers.\nSchultz in April will step down as chief executive to focus on building 1,000 new “Reserve” brand stores . Over time there also will be as many as 30 large, showcase Reserve Roastery and Tasting Rooms in major cities around the world.\nStarbucks sbux last week announced that Schultz was moving into the role of executive chairman in April to focus on the project. Analysts expect more details at a meeting in New York on Wednesday.\nThe transition marks a turning point for Starbucks, which introduced millions of people around the world to higher quality coffee and espresso drinks and now must find a way to avoid being labeled pedestrian when compared with upscale rivals like Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia, which are popping up in U.S. cities.\n“Starbucks is the millennials’ parents’ coffee house and Starbucks is acutely aware of that,” said Ric Rhinehart, executive director of the Specialty Coffee Association of America.\nStarbucks’ Reserve projects are “a reminder that they did this first and they do this best,” said AB Bernstein analyst Sara Senatore.\n \nThe company already has added Reserve bars to a handful of Starbucks shops in major cities including New York.\nReuters visited one such cafe on Manhattan’s Upper East Side, which offered $10 cups of coffee made in glass siphons, $10 “flights” of Reserve brews and nitro cold brew via a separate Reserve menu.\nTwenty-four-year-old Sauers came in for her standard Starbucks caffeine jolt and discovered the new brand.\n“I’d probably just stick to the regular, I’m not too picky,” said Sauer, a recent transplant from Ohio. But she showed the kind of aspiration that Starbucks seeks.\n“If I had the money to spend more towards coffee I’d do it,” she said, calling the Reserve bar a great idea for the neighborhood. “I think people want it, too.”\nReserve stores will exclusively sell and serve exotic, small-lot coffees that can cost $50 per 8-ounce bag. Executives expect customers to stay longer and spend more, driving twice the financial returns of typical Starbucks stores, which have average unit sales of about $1.6 million annually.\nReserve likely has room to set prices higher than Starbucks. Blue Bottle and Intelligentsia shops in Los Angeles charge $4.50 for their 12-ounce lattes, versus $3.25 at Starbucks.\nStarbucks’ 1,000 Reserve stores could boost company revenue if they hit targets, said Bernstein’s Senatore, who cautioned that Schultz’s new project has investment requirements that could become less attractive in a slowdown.\nAnd as Starbucks has already learned, moving upscale carries its own risks.\n“There is always a market for what is different, special and rare, but the minute you become so available that anyone can get what you are selling, you lose your cachet,” said market researcher Robert Passikoff, president and founder of Brand Keys.",

CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement \nAbsurdly Driven looks at the world of business with a skeptical eye and a firmly rooted tongue in cheek. \nYou may or may not have noticed that your morning coffee is costing you a little more these days. \nStarbucks has been steadily and stealthily raising its prices all year , because that's what businesses do. If they can get away with it, that is. \nThen CEO Howard Schultz stepped down. The official reason is that he's going to oversee the company's new Reserve stores . \nYou know that just in hearing the word \"Reserve,\" you're thinking wine. \nThere's nothing wrong with thinking wine. However, can you ever think of a fine dark roast in the same way that you think of a fine, dark Petit Verdot? \nStarbucks wants millennials to think in precisely this way. Its first Reserve bars are already open in larger cities where there are enough young men capable of growing a bushy beard. \nThese Reserve bars charge $10 for cups of coffee that emerge from glass siphons. Seriously. \n$10 will also buy you a flight of so-called Reserve brews. Starbucks claims that these are \"Our Rarest Coffees, Small-Batch Roasted in Seattle.\" \nThere's nothing like a small-batch roasting in Seattle to make you feel that authentic, what, Colombian flavor. \nYou can't help feeling a certain desperation to make coffee feel like wine and then edge it toward the same price. \nConsider these words from Starbucks: \"Each of our Starbucks Reserve coffees has its own story to tell, and we meticulously develop a signature roast for every one of them. We approach every coffee, every harvest, with an entirely fresh perspective. No two coffees are the same.\" \nOh, aren't they? \nTry going to three Starbucks in one morning and discovering, miraculously, that the coffee has remarkable similarities from one Starbucks to another. That used to be the whole point. \nUntil, that is, there was a Starbucks on seemingly every corner and the exclusivity was gone. \nOf course, winemakers enjoy filling their customers with nonsense, almost as much as they love to fill customers with alcohol in order to sell them wine club memberships. \nSo why can't Starbucks try and get away with it too? It doesn't even need to get people drunk. It just needs to make them feel they're buying something special. \nSurely you can't wait for some hirsute, committed barista telling you that this particular brew has notes of barley, cinnamon and drug war? \nSurely you'll be persuaded by the idea that the cup of dark liquid in your cup is redolent of pine nuts, horseradish and gravy. \nIndeed, hark at this from Starbucks' own website: \"Coffee, like wine grapes, gets much of its flavor from the specific growing conditions of each producing region. The unique variables of each growing area -- soil, temperature, elevation, the amount of rainfall and sunshine -- affect the flavor of coffee in the cup.\" \nThis sentiment could have come straight out of a wine tasting manual. \nThe trouble is that it feels like sediment. There's something entertaining about a brand as ubiquitous as Starbucks trying to sell exclusivity. \nIt's as if McDonald's suddenly tried to sell you a $10 burger. \nChocolate, though, gives you one example where millennials are prepared to pay far more for a brand that claims to be artisan, hand-made and several other terms of dubious truth. \nBut this isn't Brooklyn's warehouse 65 percent cacao nonsense. This isn't Napa's exclusive Funny Old Twisted Vines From 1847 varietal. This is Seattle's barista crew now claiming to have created a special brew. \nCan Starbucks rise to the occasion? I wonder. \nEven now, the company is promising that there will be 1,000 stores with a Reserve bar coffee experience by the end of 2017. \nWon't it feel like box wine by then?

      "text": "Shanthi Rexaline , Benzinga Staff Writer {{following ? \"Following\" : \"Follow\"}} December 07, 2016 11:31am Comments Share: \nStarbucks Corporation (NASDAQ: SBUX ) has been in the spotlight ever since it announced the decision by its celebrated CEO Howard Schultz to relinquish office in favor of chief operations officer Kevin Johnson, effective April 3, 2017. Schultz will transition to the executive chairman role. \nStarbucks is holding its biennial investor conference on Wednesday, with the event having commenced at 8 a.m. ET. 5-Year Strategic Plan \nIn a press release issued ahead of the conference, the company said it would present its five-year strategic plan, which targets at 10 percent revenue growth, 15–20 percent earnings per share growth and mid-single-digit comp growth each year. \nAmong the other key points were: Plans to open about 12,000 new stores globally by 2021. Following up on its success with the Seattle Starbucks Reserve Roastery, the company said it would accelerate the presentation of the Roastery experience around the world by opening its next Roasteries in Shanghai in 2017, Tokyo and New York in 2018; a fifth location in Europe will be announced early next year. The Starbucks Reserve stores, a new retail format integrating the Roastery experience with the culinary experience of its new Italian food partner Princi, are seen as a significant growth opportunity. Plans to open first of the Starbucks Reserve stores in Seattle and Chicago in the second half of 2017, with plans to open more globally over time. Stand-alone Princi stores to be opened in New York and Chicago in late 2017 and in early 2018. Premiumization strategy should drive innovative new customer experiences. Remains on track to open more than 5,000 stores in China by 2021 and expects the Chinese market to eclipse that in the United States over time. Seeks to expand leadership position in at-home coffee and read-to-drink. From Schultz Himself \nIn his address, Schultz reaffirmed that he would continue to be engaged in the company. He highlighted on the strong core business, robust innovation pipeline, importance of the China business and the unparalleled management team to be led by Johnson. \nSchultz touted the Starbucks Reserve and premium Starbucks experience as the company's crown jewels. The outgoing CEO also clarified that despite the slowdown in comps, there have been no evidences of cannibalization. \nMeanwhile, Johnson said cold drinks could take 50 percent of the mix of beverage sales by 2010, and lunch could drive about 20 percent of sales. Highlighting the technological prowess, Johnson said 40 percent of stores can take mobile order and payment. Johnson clarified that the Teavana acquisition added $1 billion in sales. \nAhead of the event, Cowen analyst Andrew Charles said the focus of investors would be on insights into the company's ability to sustain the 5 percent Americas comp growth over the medium term. Charles opined that the stock could move on potential announcement concerning share repurchases. \nAt time of writing, shares of Starbucks were up 0.71 percent at $57.85.  ",

      "text": "Starbucks Is Expanding Its High-End Reserve Brand By Facebook PHOTO: AFP/Getty Images \nThe coffee world was rocked last week by news that Starbucks' longtime CEO Howard Schultz will step down from the top job to become the company's executive chairman, but that doesn't mean he's stepping away from the coffee giant. On the contrary, in his new role, Schultz will reportedly be focusing on expanding Starbucks' high-end Reserve brand, and that means big changes are on the way. \nIn a presentation to investors on Wednesday, Starbucks revealed that it will begin opening more of its high-end coffee concept, Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room, on a global scale. In case you missed it, Starbucks opened its first Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle back in 2014. The store is a larger, upscale version of the Starbucks you know and love, though its main focus is showcasing rare coffees, educating customers about sourcing and offering tastings. The next Roastery will debut in Shanghai in 2017, followed by locations in Tokyo and New York City in 2018. The company also expects to announce a fifth location in Europe early next year. \nBut Starbucks also announced a completely new store format, known simply as Reserve stores. According to Starbucks, the Reserve stores will \"integrate the theatre and romance of the Roastery with the unique culinary experience of the company’s new Italian food partner, Princi.\" The first two of these new stores are set to open in Seattle and Chicago 2017, but over time, Starbucks plans to open upwards of 1,000 locations worldwide. \nAnd if you were starting to feel a little left out on behalf of your regular ole Starbucks, don't. The company will incorporate elements of the the Roastery to its normal Starbucks stores, too. This includes adding Starbucks Reserve \"experience bars\" to about 20 percent of its locations by 2021. But these new upscale additions could mean that prices are also destined to rise. According to Reuters , a Reserve bar at a New York City Starbucks offered coffees and tasting flights for $10. \nSchultz said in the presentation, \"Our Roasteries and Starbucks Reserve stores will further transform —and elevate—the Starbucks Experience we deliver to our customers, and are laying the foundation for our next wave of profitable, global growth.\" Keywords:",

      "text": "NEW YORK -- Even with Starbucks stores sometimes virtually across the street from each other in major cities, the coffee chain's leaders said Wednesday that they will open 12,000 new stores through 2021. The move will increase its store count by 50% worldwide and boost revenue by 10%, executives said.\nHoward Schultz, speaking at his final investors conference as Starbucks\" CEO, touted the company's new premium offerings which the company expects to help also boost annual revenue by double digits over the next five years.\nThe company also plans to unveil at least 1,000 Starbucks Reserve stores, featuring varied brewing methods and artisanal foods created by its new Italian food partner Princi. The company will also seek to bolster revenue by opening standalone Princi stores starting at the end of next year in New York, Chicago and Seattle.\nThe new premium strategy will be a priority for Schultz, who announced last week that he will be leaving the role of CEO to be replaced by the current Starbucks president, Kevin Johnson, as of April 3.\nSchultz vowed he will play in a continuing role as executive chairman.\n\"These are the early days in the growth and development of the company,\" Schultz said adding that while he will be focusing on the new premium initiatives \"I'm here to support Kevin. I'm here to support the team ... You can rest assured that the legacy of Starbucks continues.\"\nThe Seattle brewer outlined its growth plans before investors in New York Wednesday. Schultz built Starbucks into a global brand with 25,000 locations since joining the company more than 30 years ago.\nContributing: Associated Press",

      "text": "The Starbucks Reserve Roastery and Tasting Room in Seattle. (David Ryder/Bloomberg) For years now, Starbucks has been dipping a toe into more luxe offerings: In 2014, it opened a sprawling Roastery in Seattle where customers can drink small-batch coffee in a tasting-room-like environment. Several years earlier, it added its premium line of Reserve coffees , rare blends available for only limited-time runs.\nNow, these upscale concepts have gone from an intriguing experiment to a cornerstone of the coffee empire’s strategy: The company said recently that it will open 20 to 30 Roasteries across the globe, with Shanghai and New York locations coming soon. And its Reserve brand is being parlayed into a cafe concept, with stores that are about double the size of a traditional Starbucks. These outposts have price tags as high as $10 for certain types of coffee beverages, and will also serve alcoholic drinks.\nLast week, the company made clear how serious it was about these new brands when it announced that its chief executive, Howard Schultz, would step down from that role next year to focus on building out the Roastery and Reserve portfolio. And in a Wednesday presentation for investors, executives offered more details on how they envision these concepts buffeting the broader business.\nThe idea is that the Roastery and Reserve stores are much more of an experience than your typical Starbucks store. They’re not just a quick stop you make on your way into the office; they’re not just a drive-thru spot you roll through when your kid falls asleep in the car seat. In theory, they’re a destination, and that’s a distinction Schultz believes is critical in a country that he and other industry executives have said is “over-retailed” — meaning there are too many stores.\n“In a world where people are spending much more time on their phones, on their desktop, on their iPad, people are longing for more human connection,” Schultz said.\nThe Roasteries and Reserve stores are a way for Starbucks to try to tap into that, to try to grab a piece of the money that you spend on social experiences such as cooking classes or wine tastings or distillery tours. That’s why he said Wednesday the Seattle Roastery has “a lot more theater, a lot more romance” than what we’re used to from the Starbucks chain.\nThese new concepts will also take a somewhat different approach to food than typical Starbucks locations. They will bake fresh pastries and breads on site. That will require them to have dedicated staffers who just focus on those dishes, meaning the familiar baristas will work alongside a team of food preparers. And the New York Roastery, for example, will feature a 45-foot bar where customers can have cocktails, beer and wine, a bid to make these restaurants into evening hangout spots, not just gathering places for morning or afternoon pick-me-ups.\nSo does this mean you can expect a slowdown in new openings of traditional Starbucks stores? Not even close. The company plans to open 12,000 more of those by 2021 , with about half of those locations coming in its largest markets, the United States and China. But even in your stalwart neighborhood Starbucks store, you might notice hints of this new strategy. Over the next five years, it plans to add “Reserve Bars” to 20 percent of its regular restaurants, injecting those locations with some of the fanciness associated with the Reserve brand.\nExecutives sought to assure investors that its ramp up of the Roastery and Reserve concepts was not a reflection of wavering confidence in the old-school Starbucks brand.\n“There’s no issue in the core business. We’re merchants. We have to be creative, we have to be innovative,” Schultz said.\nThat mindset might also explain why the company is moving forward with plans to open standalone stores in the U.S. of an Italian bakery called Princi. Starbucks had revealed earlier this year that it had invested in this Milan-based purveyor of artisanal pizzas and breads. (Princi’s foccacias, loaf cakes and other goods will also be sold in Roasteries and Reserve stores.)\nStarbucks discussed its vision for its new brands as part of the unveiling its five-year financial forecasts. The company said it expects that it will deliver 10 percent growth in revenue and a 15 to 20 percent increase in earnings per share. Comparable sales, a measure of sales at restaurants open more than a year, are projected to rise “mid-single digits.”",

      "text": "Starbucks Is Reportedly Releasing a Pokémon Frappuccino Grub Street 2 hrs ago Clint Rainey According to a leaked memo published yesterday on Reddit , a few changes are in store for your local Starbucks, starting tomorrow. For one, “the majority” of U.S. locations are being “turned into a PokéStop or Gym” as a way of appealing to whatever subset of the population still plays Pokémon Go . Secondly, a brand-new Frappuccino is supposedly debuting for just this select group — essentially a Vanilla Bean Frap blended with raspberry syrup and “freeze-dried whole blackberries,” seemingly a nod to the game’s Razz Berries .\nAs part of the deal, you may have no choice but to use Pokémon Go to get said Frappuccino. This is somewhat unclear, actually, as later in the memo it says “any customer who visits” can order one, but that’s right after clearly laying out that the drink was “designed exclusively for the game,” and will pop up in the store’s Gym or PokéStop like, one assumes, a run-of-the-mill Bulbasaur or Squirtle. Trainers have to “unlock” the beverage, maybe resulting in a promo code or something, Redditors are guessing, that lets players purchase the actual drink, as well as claim “a rumored-to-be UNRELEASED Pokemon” (hence why that r/pokemongo page now has hundreds of comments ).\nIt’s possible the whole thing could be timed to coincide with a big Pokémon-character release, and Starbucks warns employees that “our participation in the game will encourage more customers to visit your store and increase the number of transactions.” It’s similar to the deal McDonald’s Japan struck with Niantic , the game’s developer, that drove that arm of the burger chain’s stocks sky-high, but just for a few months during the initial craze, so a big draw Stateside four months later seems … unlikely. In fact, Starbucks isn’t sure all its partners even know what a Pokémon is — a glossary of “key words” included for baristas suggests thinking of them as “virtual creatures of all shapes and sizes that live in the wild or alongside humans.”\nNow Watch Will Millennials Pay $10 for Starbucks Coffee?\nClick to expand Replay Video 15 Original Victoria’s Secret Models from the Class of ‘95 Before Gigi and Kendall, there was Beverly Peele and Stephanie Seymour.
