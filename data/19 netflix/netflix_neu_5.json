      "text": "If you’re a photographer and Netflix subscriber , you’ll defiantly want to set aside some time to watch Tales By Light . \nThe series is joint venture between National Geographic and Canon. \nSeason 1 (six half hour long episodes – available on Netflix worldwide) follows five photographers around the world documenting their approach to photography and story telling. \nContinue reading to watch the trailer for both Season 1 and Season 2… Tales By Light – Season 1 Trailer \nSeason 1 of Tales by Light was released by Netflix worldwide on November 11th, 2016. Six half hour long episodes are available, featuring photographers Art Wolfe , Darren Jew , Richard I’Anson , Peter Eastway , and Krystle Wright . Tales By Light – Season 2 Trailer \nSeason 2 of Tales by Light was broadcast by National Geographic in Australia this fall, but is not yet available on Netflix. Season 2 consists of three, hour long episodes featuring photographers Jonathan & Angela Scott , Eric Cheng and Stephen Dupont . Tales By Light Review \nIf you’re a photographer, you’re going to love this series. It’s extremely inspiring, gorgeous to watch and so insightful to get inside the heads of fellow photographers (although it would have been nice to see a more even mix of female photographers). \nAnd while the photographers are the stars of the show – what I was absolutely captivated by was the live action footage captured by cinematographer Abraham Joffe and his crew for the series. \nIt’s one thing to see how a still image is captured and then see the finished photograph – but its a whole other level when you realize that the entire series is just as amazing (if not more so) than those individual still photographs. \nAs a photographer, I appreciate the craft of photography – but the work and attention to detail that must have gone into the cinematography is truly stunning!

      "text": "Tweet \nAside from the massive hits on HBO at the moment such as Game of Thrones and Westworld, HBO has begun producing a brand new comedy series in 2016 starring Sarah Parker and Thomas Church. Many of you are probably wondering whether or not Divorce will be coming to Netflix, so let’s take a look. \nThe show, which has already been renewed for a second season is one of the best debuts for the network in 2016. As we mentioned above, it stars Sex and the City’s Sarah Parker who plays Frances, a woman going through a divorce and sets out to find out what her life is about while going through a super strenuous divorce. \nIt’s received glowing reviews so far and the first season is set to contain ten episodes. \nFor those in the United States, the series initially airs on HBO and then is put onto their HBO Now platform. From there it may go to Amazon Prime after a few years waiting but for those looking for it on Netflix you’ll be sad to hear that the chances are very slim. Like most of HBO’s current and back catalog, HBO has specifically chosen to not include its stuff on Netflix because it sees it as a direct competitor. This applies to every HBO show and will no doubt remain unchanged for many years to come. \nIn the United Kingdom, the show has been bought up by Sky Atlantic meaning the series is exclusively available on there plus Sky’s streaming platform NowTV and therefore won’t be appearing on Netflix there anytime soon. \nFor those in Australia, the series airs on Showcase and Canada the same applies for the US as it airs on HBO Canada and then remains on that platform.

PHOTO: NETFLIX Published http://str.sg/4Qco Copy Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip in The Crown, is drawn to people who are on the fringes of the world they live in Yip Wai Yee In London \n8Q \nWhen British actor Matt Smith signed on to play Prince Philip in Netflix's royal drama The Crown, he received advice from none other than Prince Philip's grandson, Prince William himself. \nHe met the prince at a charity polo match last year through a mutual acquaintance and was introduced with the line: \"This is Matt Smith and he is about to play Prince Philip - do you have any advice for him?\" \nRecounting the story to The Straits Times at an interview in London's Corinthia Hotel, the 34-year-old actor jokingly says with a groan: \"I was just thinking, 'Oh my god, I'm going to die of embarrassment.' But he just shook my hand and said one word - legend.\" \nHe laughs and adds: \"And I realised he was absolutely right. Prince Philip really is quite a legend.\" \nOver the years, Prince Philip, the consort of Queen Elizabeth II, has gained a reputation for being blunt, even horribly undiplomatic, due to his many verbal blunders. \nThe 95-year-old reportedly once told a 13-year-old visitor of a space shuttle: \"Well, you'll never fly in it, you're too fat to be an astronaut.\" \nSmith comes to his defence, citing Prince Philip's difficult childhood: His mother was committed to a sanatorium, his father went off with a mistress and his pregnant sister died in a plane crash while coming to visit him. \nHe says: \"Then, when his wife became queen, he has to always walk two steps behind her and be constantly emasculated. \n\"When you look at the history of his life, I think it has made him a certain way. His circumstances have led him to speak his mind and against things, but he also has this profound love for his wife and he wants to respect her. I definitely have a lot of affection for him now.\" \nThe Crown, whose first season is out on Internet streaming service Netflix, dramatises the early reign of Queen Elizabeth II during post-World War II Britain. \nThe lavish US$130-million (S$185.6-million) show is Smith's most high-profile project since he starred in the iconic Doctor Who sci-fi series from 2010 to 2013 in the lead as the quirky Eleventh Doctor. \nAlthough the two roles are vastly different, the actor, who is reportedly dating British actress Lily James, sees a connection. \"They are aliens in many ways in their own worlds. They're both outsiders. I find that I'm often drawn to these people who are just slightly on the fringes of the world they're involved in.\" \n1 If you met Prince Philip right now, what would you say to him? \nI would say - you're such a rock star. He has always been a bit of a maverick, you know? \nHe has always been a forward thinker and he has always told the Queen, \"Let's think outside the box.\" He was a moderniser and just a remarkable man. \n2 Were you daunted by the idea of playing such a famous figure? \nThere is a bit of trepidation, but I'm proud of the work. \nYou do as much research as you can and then a lot of thinking, and thinking, and thinking. Then you stop thinking and you start doing. And that's it. \n3 In The Crown, you have to bare your bum in a few scenes because Prince Philip is known to sleep naked. Did you do extra squats before filming? \n(Laughs) I couldn't. I had a knee injury at the time, so I couldn't do any squats. Otherwise, I would have wanted to. I hope the scenes looked okay. \n4 Winston Churchill in The Crown is played by John Lithgow, who is American. What did you think about that casting decision? \nHe's one of my favourite actors of all time. He's amazing. He's brilliant and I just love him in so many movies. So I was excited to meet him. And when I met him, I was like, \"Wow, amazing.\" I was a fanboy. \n5 The royal family has fame thrust upon it. As an actor, that can happen overnight too. How do you deal with fame in a graceful way? \nYou just act gracefully in situations where you're required to be graceful. Fame is a very strange and intangible thing and it's not something that is easily defined. So you take each moment as it comes and you try to be as normal as possible and give everyone the right amount of time. \n6 There are rumours you are returning to star in Doctor Who. How true are those rumours? \n(Laughs) There are rumours that I'm coming back? Well, there are always rumours. I don't know, I haven't been approached. But I would consider any approach and take it very seriously. \n7 Do you still watch Doctor Who, whose lead role is now played by Peter Capaldi? \nYes and I will always support it because it gave me such a wonderful break. I am a huge fan. Peter is wonderful. \n8 How would you like to be remembered? \nFondly, in good terms, and honestly. I don't know, it's not something I've considered because it's a bit sad. It leads you to the idea that you're going to die, so maybe I'll just leave it to other people to remember me. \n•Follow Yip Wai Yee on Twitter \n•All 10 episodes of The Crown Season 1 are on Netflix.

      "text": "This post contains spoilers about Netflix's Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life. LOS ANGELES — Last we saw Doyle, the feminist and former Yale Daily News editor was ready to go anywhere with girlfriend/partner/love of life Paris Geller.\nSadly, in Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, we find out that Doyle and Paris' romance has come to an end and the two are in the process of getting a divorce.\nThe reason? Doyle (Danny Strong) has gone Hollywood.\n\"Frankly it was over the minute he wanted to do something creative,\" Paris (Liza Weil) tells Rory (Alexis Bledel) as they are catching up in Stars Hollow in part one of the revival, titled \"Winter.\"\n\"In real life, that Hollywood career path for Strong also stuck. \"\n\"Well, he's a screenwriter now, Rory. Have you been to the movies lately? Suddenly he's in jeans, and wearing faded $200 rock t-shirts with bands on them he's never seen. He's flying out to the coast, as if this is not a coast. He drinks vodka because it has less carbs. And then he started selling things so I realized, 'Oh this is going to stick.'\"\nIn real life, that Hollywood career path for Strong also stuck.\nYes, he acted on Gilmore Girls, Buffy the Vampire Slayer and other shows and movies. But Strong, who won two Emmys, has become known for his writing. He helped pen Recount, HBO's Game Change, Lee Daniels' The Butler and the final two Hunger Games movies .\nSEE ALSO: The 'Gilmore Girls' revival is here, and so are the dramatic responses from fans\nOh right, he also co-created Fox's hit musical show Empire.\nLater, we see Doyle calling Rory after she edits a review of Jungle Book which he wrote for the Stars Hollow Gazette. He complains about her edits, noting that he's writing a couple things for Michael Bay who is \"really into adjectives.\"\n\"Are you saying I'm a sellout?\" Doyle says. \"Because I played Snooker at [Michael Bay's] house last night and he's a really cool guy.\"\nImage: netflix screengrab\nIn the second episode, we learn that Paris lives in a five-floor townhouse in New York and has two kids with Doyle, plus a nanny who hates going up and down stairs.\nShe and Doyle are still in the process of getting divorced, and he pops by to drop the kids off.\nImage: netflix/screengrab\nThey argue, much like they did when they were editors together, but sadly it's unclear whether their chemistry will make them rethink that divorce.\nDon't worry: Powerhouse Paris is fine running a fertility clinic that also offers legal services (because she ended up getting a law degree and going to med school).\nAnd at least Doyle's got Hollywood.",

      "text": "Image source: Netflix\nContinue Reading Below\nOver the summer, millions of Netflix (NASDAQ: NFLX) users saw their monthly subscription price increase $1 or $2. Netflix announced its initial price increase -- from $8 to $9 -- more than two years ago, but it quickly followed up with another $1 price increase in October of last year. Today, nearly all of Netflix's 47.5 million U.S. subscribers pay $10 per month.\nHowever, Netflix has had a tough time adding subscribers over the last two quarters as it experienced more customers leaving the service right before the price increase hit their credit cards. With competitors like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) offering a similar service for less (including the other benefits that come with Prime), some customers are wondering whether a Netflix membership is really worth $10 per month.

Heres His New Pick Netflix is in its fourth year of producing original content, and already more television viewers favor its originals over any other network's, according to a survey reported in Variety this year. That includes the critically acclaimed show factory that is Time Warner 's (NYSE: TWX) HBO.\nImportantly, HBO typically charges more than Netflix. Stand-alone HBO Now service costs $15 per month. While some consumers may be able to get a discount through their cable provider, that's about in line with what you'll have to pay if you want the \"So Original\" HBO.\nContinue Reading Below",

      "title": "How Netflix’s Gilmore Girls Addressed the Worst Problems of the Original",
      "text": "Twitter Courtesy of Netflix. Warning: this article contains discussion of certain key plot points from the first two episodes of Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , as well as discussion of stories from the original series. If you aren’t ready to read anything about those episodes, now is the time to leave! When it was first announced that four new super-sized episodes of the beloved Gilmore saga would be coming to Netflix in 2016, some were worried that this was less about an honest desire to revisit Stars Hollow and more about Netflix’s cynical desire to use nostalgia to rope viewers in. Creator Amy Sherman-Palladino made it clear that as far as she was concerned, the revival was simply a way to “catch up with all three of our Gilmore girls over the course of a year.” But could the company behind algorithm-generated, rebooted/revived content like Fuller House and Season 4 of Arrested Development be trusted not to push too hard on the nostalgia? Does Gilmore Girls just feel like a retread? The answer, to a certain degree, is yes. But it also feels like a very necessary one. Die-hard fans of the Gilmore Girls series will know that Sherman-Palladino left the show before its seventh and final season—and, as far as some are concerned, the show was never the same without her. But I would argue that, like most shows that extend beyond a handful of seasons, the original Gilmore Girls was already on the decline. The Gilmore women started making out-of-character decisions that felt engineered specifically to create inorganic drama. The trouble started at the end of Season 4 ,when Rory ( Alexis Bledel ) started sleeping with her now married ex-boyfriend, Dean ( Jared Padalecki ). It felt like a very un-Rory decision that drove a wedge between Rory and Lorelai ( Lauren Graham ). That wedge became a chasm at the end of the fifth season, when Rory, injured by the words of the father of her boyfriend, Logan ( Matt Czuchry ), decided to drop out of Yale. It was the worst moment in seven seasons of Gilmore Girls —but, thankfully, Netflix has given Sherman-Palladino another shot at getting it right. The fact that the bookish Rory (for whom school was everything ) tucked tail and ran was bad enough. This is the girl who not only weathered the storm that was Paris Gellar ( Liza Weil ), but also tamed her and made her a lifelong friend! And the fact that her grandfather Richard (the late Edward Herrmann) gave her asylum was even worse. The plot served to blow up the relationship between Rory and Lorelai, and effectively shattered the very spine of the series. Because nobody (except maybe Emily) was acting like themselves in this story line, it felt like a cheap will-they, won’t-they tactic laid over a mother-daughter relationship that should have been able to withstand much more. So, what does all this have to do with the revival? Well, if you’ve seen its first two installments—“Winter” and “Spring”—you’ll see that Rory is reliving some of those same story-line beats nearly a decade later. Now in her early 30s, Rory is, yes, once again sleeping with an ex-boyfriend who is committed to someone else. But this time, her approach, while self-destructive, is less mindlessly selfish. Logan is and always will be a cad. A likable cad, and still my favorite of all of Rory’s suitors, but a cad nonetheless. He’s not some poor, lovesick Dean she’s manipulating in order to work out her own issues: Logan will be fine when he gets to the other side of this. He has clear Rory boundaries in place. His fiancée may be another story—but at least we, the audience, don’t have to meet her yet. And though Rory keeps the truth of their relationship from her mom at first, we see her come clean by “Spring”—and the conversation between Lorelai and Rory is a lovely and healing rewrite of the terrible, uncharacteristic fight they had in Season 4’s “Raincoats and Recipes.” But as Sherman-Palladino promised , this revival isn’t really about the Logans, Deans, and Jesses of Rory’s world. It’s more about her settling on a satisfying career. And as we watch Rory flounder and bounce from one wrong job opportunity to the next, over the course of six months, she represents countless talented young people in this country who are struggling to find a job even with fancy degrees in their back pockets. But the point is, we’re watching Rory try —which is far less frustrating then it was to watch her quit back in Season 5. Yes, smart men and women quit college all the time. And, yes, Gilmore Girls needed to show Rory Gilmore, the special snowflake of Stars Hollow, bumping up against some challenges she couldn’t quite handle in the real world. But Mitchum Huntzberger ( Gregg Henry ) should not have been enough to take her down back in Season 5. (How nice, then, to see her meet him again in the revival and defiantly keep her chin up—for the most part.) Here, in the revival, it’s a number of dispiriting failures slowly building up over half a year that wind up taking down Rory Gilmore and sending her packing— not to Emily Gilmore’s pool house, but to the welcoming arms of her childhood home. It's the quarter-life crisis someone as driven and disciplined as Rory was due for, and, this time, it feels earned. Best of all, she and Lorelai are a united front now. I don’t expect we’ll see Rory down for long. She may wind up teaching at Chilton before her story is through—it seems like the show has left that door open for her. And if that did happen, it wouldn’t feel like a those-who-can’t-do-teach moment—it would be an understandable future for the bookish Gilmore. To go from Yale dropout to permanent school fixture? It’s a nice, circuitous, and down-to-earth ending for our Rory, who might learn the lesson that while glossy magazine jobs high in the sky of New York City might seem alluring, sometimes, it’s good to go right back where you started.

      "text": "Is Netflix doing nostalgia better than anyone else right now? Sunday Nov 27, 2016 at 3:00 PM By Bethonie ButlerThe Washington Post \nNostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix. \nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix released \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday. \nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras — Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content. \n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\" \nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content. \n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx. \n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment. \nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing. \nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said. \nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing. \nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot — \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format - \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.) \nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example. \n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"",

      "text": "The modern human’s worst nightmare: a power outage. Left without cat memes, Netflix, and — of course — Hackaday, there’s little to do except participate in the temporary anarchy that occurs when left without internet access. Lamenting over expensive and bulky uninterruptible power supplies, Youtube user [Gadget Addict] hacked together a UPS power bank that might just stave off the collapse of order in your household.\nThis simple and functional hack really amounts to snipping the end off of a USB power cable. The cable is then attached to a screw terminal to barrel connector adapter and plugged it into a pass-through power USB power bank. No, really — that’s all there is to it. [Gadget Addict] notes that while most modems and routers are designed to run off a 12V power supply, they still operate at 5V. He goes on to connect several router and router/modem combination units to the power bank. In each case the system appears to boot up and perform normally.\n\n\nThe particular UPS unit [Gadget Addict] was using has a lead acid battery that was prone to failure on an almost annual basis — which defeats the purpose of a backup power supply for even a non-critical system. This quick hack could be the ounce of prevention that offsets the potentially hours of internet-less boredom that strikes with your next power outage. An accompanying solar-powered 3D printer should also keep you plenty occupied.\n[Thanks for the submission, Gadget Addict!]",

      "text": "Comments The 'Gilmore Girls' creators talk about the possibility of more episodes of Netflix's revival 'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life'. \nNetflix released four new feature-length episodes of \"Gilmore Girls\" on November 25. After the bombshell ending in the \" Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \" episode titled \"Fall\" left viewers reeling, the creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and husband, Daniel Palladino, gave some hints about the possibility of more \"Gilmore Girls\" episodes. \"We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,\" said Sherman-Palladino to The Hollywood Reporter . She further explained, \"So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, is there more, is there more, is there more - this has to go out into the universe now.\" She added, \"We've got to put this to bed and then whatever happens, happens.\" The seventh season of \"Gilmore Girls\" didn't end the way the creators had always planned. That happened because the creators left the series due to a contract conflict. But now through this Netflix revival, they have the opportunity to finish the story the way they had always intended. However, when Sherman-Palladino originally thought of \" final four words ,\" she said there was a small chance of doing a revival or a sequel. But viewers were speculating that the streaming giant would already ask her for more episodes. \n© AceShowbiz.com More Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life News",

Even Edward Herrmann, who played Richard Gilmore and passed away in 2014, was a huge presence on the show. But one OG cast member did double duty, reprising her original character and a new one.\n Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy, Stars Hollow's resident mechanic (/miracle worker, considering how long she's kept Lorelai's car running) took on a second role in the revival. Did you spot her?\nAbdoo also played Berta, Emily's unintelligible maid. Emily is notorious for letting maids go after just a few days (or less), but Berta stands the test of time, lasting the entire revival season and even following Emily to her new home in Nantucket.\nNetflix If you missed this the first time through Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , you are not alone. Abdoo is a chameleon.\nFrom: Marie Claire\n ",

A Dinosaur's Story, Dec. 1: One of the movies that made me instantly fall in love with dinosaurs and New York City. \nWhite Girl, Dec. 1: A much-talked about and controversial indie about a young college freshman who attempts to get a drug dealer out of jail. \nColony, season 1, Dec. 13: Los Angeles has been invaded by outside forces (aliens?), causing a huge rift between residents and the government. Not full blown sci-fi or dystopian drama. Just right. Stars Josh Holloway ( Lost ) and Sarah Wayne Callies ( The Walking Dead ). \nBarry, Dec. 16: Australian actor Devon Terrell plays a 20-year-old Barack Obama, who's just arrived for his junior year at Columbia University in 1981. This year is supposedly pivotal in establishing Obama's views on race, government and want it means to be an American. We are going to miss President Obama so much. \nMarvel's Captain America: Civil War, Dec. 25: Come for the Avengers, stay for the Captain America/Winter Soldier bromance and BLACK PANTHER.

      "text": "Nostalgia has swept through television and film in recent years, but our collective throwback obsession has been particularly fruitful at Netflix.\nIn addition to channeling past decades with Baz Luhrmann's hip-hop saga \"The Get Down\" and the '80s-era phenomenon that is \"Stranger Things,\" the streaming network has revamped animated kids' favorites such as \"Popples\" and \"Voltron\" and released a film adaptation of the beloved novel \"The Little Prince.\" \"Beat Bugs,\" another animated series, combines kid-friendly stories with songs by the Beatles. Netflix will release \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" a four-episode revival of the popular WB-turned-CW show \"Gilmore Girls,\" on Friday.\nOf course, Netflix isn't the first to evoke bygone eras -- Nickelodeon was a pioneer of nostalgia programming, resurfacing popular teen shows such as \"All That\" and \"Clarissa Explains It All\" in 2011. But that was before the days of \"peak TV\" and before streaming (as opposed to, say, Netflix's early DVD mailers) became ubiquitous. At Netflix, nostalgia's reign is less about fitting in with pop culture trends than it is about the streaming network's ambitious plans for original content.\n\"We're looking, always, for the great stories,\" said Netflix chief content officer Ted Sarandos. \"We're not setting out to find nostalgic projects, but sometimes in the hunt for great stuff, somebody has a great take on something that is hugely familiar.\"\nAs reported by Variety and others, the streaming network announced recently that it is raising $1 billion through a new debt offering to fund more original content. In September, Netflix reiterated its focus on original series and films. Netflix planned to release about 600 hours of original programming in 2016. Next year, the network expects to release more than 1,000 hours of original content.\n\"Stranger Things\" wasn't a traditional reboot, but it paid homage to pop culture mainstays of the late '70s and '80s, including Ridley Scott's \"Alien,\" Rob Reiner's 1986 film \"Stand By Me\" and '80s film fare from Steven Spielberg, including \"E.T.\" Similarly, \"The Get Down\" added to the nostalgia craze with an extravagant but well-researched take on the early days of hip-hop in the Bronx.\n\"Stranger Things\" was a surprise summer hit, though Sarandos said the network \"definitely knew we had something special\" after watching the early cuts of the episodes. According to research released by Netflix in September, most people who became big enough fans to watch all 10 episodes of the sci-fi thriller did so after finishing the second installment.\nSarandos said \"Stranger Things\" is popular on a global scale, although that's difficult to quantify because Netflix doesn't share ratings information. Sarandos said the company knows viewing numbers \"with incredible granularity,\" but it doesn't consider viewership the best measure of success because it doesn't sell advertising. Instead, the company focuses on subscriber growth, which is on an upswing.\nAnecdotally, Sarandos points to the the immense social media following that \"Stranger Things\" and the members of its largely unknown cast earned after the premiere in August as evidence of the show's dedicated fan base. \"There's no question when something is working in America or anywhere else in the world because everyone is talking about it,\" Sarandos said.\nWhen it comes to more traditional reboots, Netflix has arguably been more discerning than other networks about which shows are revived. \"Full House\" and \"Gilmore Girls\" both have multigenerational fan bases (the result of longtime syndication and treasured DVD box sets) that make the idea of continuing those stories appealing.\nAnd Netflix isn't just remaking these series the way that, say, CBS did with its short-lived \"Rush Hour\" reboot -- \"Fuller House\" and the \"Gilmore Girls\" miniseries are essentially sequels. (Not that the broadcast networks haven't succeeded, at times, with the remake format -- \"MacGyver\" has done well on Friday night for CBS, \"Lethal Weapon\" has held its own in the ratings despite mixed reviews, and \"The Exorcist,\" which isn't a ratings hit, is surprisingly worth watching if you're a fan of the horror genre.)\nSarandos credits the easy availability of old movies and shows with enabling younger audiences to find familiar references in \"Stranger Things\" and \"The Get Down.\" \"It's all in the rich details that you think would be completely lost on the young audience,\" he said, using the rotary phones in \"Stranger Things\" as an example.\n\"My 20-year-old son never said 'What's that?' because he's so used to seeing it (on) film and television,\" Sarandos said. \"It's almost like life and art just happen on a constant continuum now and are played out through television.\"\nGet articles sent to your inbox.

      "text": "Warning: Spoilers for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nThe Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ending raised a number of questions among fans: namely whether the show will come back for even more episodes.\nNetflix’s Gilmore Girls revival ended with the much-hyped final four words that creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had originally planned, with Rory revealing to her mother that she is pregnant. Although the dialogue is what Sherman-Palladino had intended to finish the show’s original run, the cliffhanger ending has provided countless theories for viewers who might not be ready to say goodbye to the girls just yet.\nWhen asked about the possibility of more episodes of Gilmore Girls at Netflix, Sherman-Palladino told The Hollywood Reporter that she was waiting to see how the new episodes went over with audiences.\n“We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,” she said. “So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’—this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.”\nBringing the show back for a second run at Netflix would involve a lot of coordination among the very busy cast and executive producers. But Scott Patterson, who plays Luke Danes, seemed more enthusiastic about the prospect when asked about it earlier this year.\n“It’d be nice to do it every year,” he told The Hollywood Reporter . “Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.”\n ",

      "text": "10 questions we still have after the 'Gilmore Girls' revival 'Gilmor Girls' Saeed Adyani / Netflix \nAlexis Bledel as Rory and Lauren Graham as Lorelai in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" \nAlexis Bledel as Rory and Lauren Graham as Lorelai in \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\" (Saeed Adyani / Netflix) Emily Yahr Washington Post \nSpoiler alert: Do not read if you haven’t watched “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Netflix. \nNetflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival (theoretically) had one major purpose: to provide closure to fans who wanted to see how creator Amy Sherman-Palladino envisioned the end of the series, given that she exited the original show before the final season in 2006. \nNow that we've watched the revival, which was released Friday, we only have one response to the idea of \"closure\": LOL. We have even more questions now - and not only because of that bombshell final scene. \n1) Why did Rory and Logan start that ridiculous affair? \nApparently at some point in the last 10 years, Logan forgave Rory for turning down his proposal before college graduation, and she forgave him for proposing in front of her entire family. Then they started a torrid affair, even though Logan is engaged to a French heiress named Odette, and Rory is dating a lame guy named Paul. \nRory and Logan always had great chemistry, but why would they adopt a \"when we're together, we're together, and when we're not, we're not\" policy? It didn't work when they tried to be \"no strings attached\" at Yale, and there's no way it would work while Logan is engaged and Rory has a boyfriend. And, honestly, they both acted a little too casual about the fact that they were cheating on their significant others. \n2) Who is the father of Rory's baby? \nWhen you end a show with a main character saying \"I'm pregnant,\" this is a pretty obvious question. So is the father Logan? Paul? The guy in the Wookiee costume? (Probably not, based on timing.) The audience will always wonder, which we suppose is the whole point of such a maddening ending. \n3) Why did Rory think her mother would be excited about the \"Gilmore Girls\" book? \nIn the midst of a career crisis, Rory decides to write a book based on her and Lorelai's unique life and relationship. Great idea, except Rory had to know that her mother would be upset by this plan. Why would Lorelai want her story, one filled with a lot of deeply personal situations (teenage pregnancy, estrangement from parents, etc.) on display for the whole world? \nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR \nNaturally, Lorelai refuses to give her blessing for the book. Rory is furious. She vents to her best friend, Lane, and is completely flummoxed by Lorelai's reaction. \"She totally freaked out over a book,\" Rory complains. \"She knows I'm a writer, she knows everything is fodder.\" \nDoes Rory actually believe that nonsense? It seemed out of character for her to not even consider Lorelai's perspective - which, by the way, is completely understandable. \n4) What's going to happen with the book? \nOf course, Lorelai ultimately (reluctantly) gives her blessing anyway, and jokes that she'll just sue Rory if she doesn't like the finished product. So is \"The Gilmore Girls\" going to become a best-seller? Oh, sorry, just \"Gilmore Girls\" - as Lorelai tells Rory, \"Drop the 'the.' It's cleaner.\" Maybe that \"Social Network\" reference means Rory is going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg. \n5) What will happen with Christopher? \nWe were wondering if Christopher, Rory's father and Lorelai's first love, would make an appearance. Then, all of a sudden, there he was, working at the family business, still extremely rich. He gets a brief scene as Rory pays him a visit, and asks him how he felt about Lorelai raising her alone. It sounds like research for her book, but she may also want advice about her own pregnancy situation. \nWe also find out Christopher stays far, far away from the about-to-be-happily-married Luke and Lorelai. Will he ever return to mess things up for Lorelai again? \n6) How will Emily do in Nantucket? \nRealizing she no longer wanted to live in her Hartford mansion without Richard, Emily packs everything up and moves to Nantucket, where she lives in a gorgeous house on the ocean and volunteers at a whaling museum. Nope, not the ending we would have predicted for the queen of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), but it was worth it to see her lose it and yell \"bull---!\" so many times during her last DAR meeting, finally sick of the society life. \n7) Will Paris and Doyle get back together? \nIt was a little heartbreaking that this dysfunctional yet weirdly perfect couple got a divorce, even though Doyle is now a screenwriter, in a nice nod to Danny Strong's actual career. Frankly, the way Paris and Doyle interact as a divorced couple (in front of Rory, who briefly steps in to babysit their kids) isn't too different from how they acted when they were together, so ... you never know. \n8) Will Lane and Zach ever get out of Stars Hollow? \nPoor Lane. Rory's best friend was once on the road to being a rock 'n' roll star. Now, she's still stuck in Stars Hollow working at her mom's antique store and looking after her rambunctious 9-year-old twins. Sure, she and her husband, Zach, still play in their band, but Zach is also stuck in a crushingly boring office job. Will they ever live their musical dreams on the road? \n9) What will happen to the Dragonfly Inn? \nThat quick scene with Melissa McCarthy, reprising her role as Lorelai's best friend, chef Sookie St. James, was a cruel tease in the fourth episode. She and Lauren Graham are hilarious together, so it's too bad that McCarthy's movie star schedule didn't leave her more time to come back for the revival. \nWill Sookie ever quit her fancy farm (?) gig and come back? Will Michel really take that job in New York? Either way, Lorelai is determined to expand the Dragonfly, even using money in her father's will (originally set aside for Luke to franchise his diner) to open a second location in town. Soon, maybe the Dragonfly will be the place Jennifer Lawrence stays when she comes to Stars Hollow. \n10) Are Rory and Jess destined to be together? \nHmmm. While Rory definitively ended up alone in the final episode, we saw Jess steal that longing glance at her right before Luke and Lorelai's wedding. He gave Rory the idea to write the \"Gilmore Girls\" book, so it's likely he'll be back in the picture. \nRELATED STORIES:",

      "text": "\nWarning: Spoilers for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life \nThe Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life ending raised a number of questions among fans: namely whether the show will come back for even more episodes.\nNetflix’s Gilmore Girls revival ended with the much-hyped final four words that creator Amy Sherman-Palladino had originally planned, with Rory revealing to her mother that she is pregnant. Although the dialogue is what Sherman-Palladino had intended to finish the show’s original run, the cliffhanger ending has provided countless theories for viewers who might not be ready to say goodbye to the girls just yet.\n\nWhen asked about the possibility of more episodes of Gilmore Girls at Netflix, Sherman-Palladino told The Hollywood Reporter that she was waiting to see how the new episodes went over with audiences.\n“We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey,” she said. “So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, ‘Is there more, is there more, is there more?’—this has to go out into the universe now. We’ve got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.”\nBringing the show back for a second run at Netflix would involve a lot of coordination among the very busy cast and executive producers. But Scott Patterson, who plays Luke Danes, seemed more enthusiastic about the prospect when asked about it earlier this year.\n“It’d be nice to do it every year,” he told The Hollywood Reporter . “Maybe every two years, do a three-month thing, do four more chapters. It was easy to do. It was fun. It was really rewarding and people got a sense that if this was going to be the last thing that we now have some closure.”\n \n",

      "text": "Share Tweet \nAny discussion of the British Netflix series Lovesick must first acknowledge that it originally premiered as Scrotal Recall . The former name was a blessing and a curse. On the one hand, it certainly raised some eyebrows. On the other, it completely misrepresented the show, which happens to be the story of an overly emotional bloke who is diagnosed with chlamydia. Lovesick —while still perhaps overly reliant on a pun—is more fitting. Not just because it’s not as crass, but also because it’s a good representation of how the show makes its viewers feel. Upon finishing the second season, which premiered on Netflix earlier in November, my heart broke. \nThe first episode of the entire series establishes that this show is not just about a man with an STI. It’s also makes it clear that it’s not interested in his sexual exploits, so much as it is about his quest for love and how that relates to one person in particular: Evie. The first season ended on a major cliffhanger for the two of them. Evie, about to get married, is having a drink with Dylan when their friend Luke bursts in and tells Evie that Dylan loves her. It’s an ending that leaves Dylan the vulnerable party, though Evie herself is also experiencing a complicated onslaught of emotions. She finally has confirmation of what she’s long wanted to hear, but only as she’s moving on her with her life. \nEight episodes later, the action is paused in a very similar position, except Dylan is now the one content in his relationship, and Evie is left single and heartbroken. It’s a frustrating conclusion, but not necessarily a bad or unsatisfying one. The new installments only deepen the sense that Evie and Dylan are fated because flashback structure gives the audience even more insight into their history. We see their initial hookup—born out of disappointing party dates—and how Dylan’s initial eagerness to turn it into something more sends the less-romantic Evie running. We learn that Dylan sleeps with Evie’s sister by accident. We understand how Evie comes to articulate her true feelings for Dylan. If this all seems a little confusing, well, that’s one of the show’s faults. Its time hopping can make the chronology overly complicated to follow. However, as annoying as it can be sometimes, learning the information piecemeal is rewarding. Dylan and Evie’s story isn’t an especially novel one. It’s a variation on traditional rom-com formulas, but what makes it special is the way it’s told. Antonia Thomas and Johnny Flynn in Lovesick. (Screenshot: Netflix) \nIn the present day timeline, Dylan is pursing a relationship with Abigail, a bartender he sleeps with in the pilot at his friend Angus’ wedding. It’s easy to root for them. Calm and funny Abigail is a good foil for Dylan’s amorous neuroticism. That is, until she has villain potential: A flashback reveals that Evie and Abigail actually meet before Abigail and Dylan do. Abigail is working the bar the night the gang first visits her hotel to sample it as a potential venue. Evie, sleepless, comes downstairs for a drink, and the two end up bonding about their guy troubles. Evie confesses that she has been thinking about her best friend, and helps Abigail break up with a clingy chef. If not for a pissed off concierge, who throws away a note Evie leaves for her, the two may have become good friends. \nSo did Abigail know that Dylan was the one that Evie was talking about? Well, no. Years later Dylan takes Abigail to Angus’ divorce party to introduce her to his pals. There she and Evie recognize one another, and Abigail realizes that Dylan was the one she was talking about all those months back. But there’s no blow-up, and Abigail wasn’t knowingly sabotaging anything: The two resolve any conflict with understanding. Abigail only gets angry when she comes to learn that Dylan lied to her about just how many times he and Evie were together. During the finale’s last moments Dylan comes to figure out why Abigail is devastated, and they reconcile. Meanwhile, Evie admits that she has called her wedding off. She is , after all, still in love with Dylan. Daniel Ings and Antonia Thomas in Lovesick (Screenshot: Netflix) \nI’m not sure how much longer the show can tease out this will they/won’t they, but it has done a great job of making it even more interesting, two seasons in—not an easy feat. This is because Lovesick is more about time than it is about relationships. It understands how people come in and out of one another’s lives, and how every encounter is meaningful, regardless of the detours it may inspire. Take, for instance, Luke: He’s initially established as a lothario. Turns out his desire to fuck around was a result of past sadness. In the long run, it doesn’t matter whether or not Evie and Dylan finally get together. That may be too neat for this series, but it’s also the reason it’s worth watching.",

      "text": "Mythbusters build team reunites for Netflix series in new trailer Science! share Following the end of Mythbusters earlier this year on Discovery, the team is heading to Netflix to continue their off the wall scientific experiments. Well, part of them. Tory Belleci, Kari Byron and Grant Imahara will star in Netflix’s White Rabbit Project , which is essentially an off-shoot of Mythbusters . Missing from the lineup are Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman most notably, who decided to leave the show last October after more than 14 seasons on the air. Based on the trailer seen above, Belleci, Byron and Imahara will almost replicate exactly what they were doing on Mythbusters, but will be able to get into a little more trouble because they’re not governed by traditional broadcast standards. Scenarios like complicated jailbreaks, heists, pushing the limits of cars and other demystifying will play out in the series. Episodes will debut on the streaming service on Dec. 9, and like other Netflix shows, will be available to binge all at once. Mythbusters , unfortunately, is not available to stream on Netflix at this time. More From Polygon",

      "text": "\nNow that many people have binge-watched Netflix’s Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life , fans are wondering if the show could return for more episodes. This revival was always slated to be a one-time return of the series so that the original showrunners could wrap things up in a way that fit their vision, but the way things ended for Rory and Lorelei, many think that an ongoing return is a necessity. Could there be more of the show on the way?\nFor years, Gilmore Girls fans had wondered what the last four words of the series were supposed to be and now they finally know. As those who have followed the show know, Amy Sherman-Palladino and her husband Dan Palladino started the series and always had a plan for how it would end. However, contract disputes led to their departure after Season 6 and they were not in the picture for the last season.\nWith the revival on Netflix, Amy was finally able to use the last four words she had always intended to use and it brought a shocker in a brief exchange between Rory and Lorelei. The A Year in the Life revival was intended to give fans closure, and it certainly did bring Rory and Lorelei around full circle. However, it also left viewers hanging in some key ways and people have been buzzing online about wanting more. Could everybody come back to do more episodes?\nSherman-Palladino told the Hollywood Reporter that they had a “very specific journey” planned for Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life and they feel as if they accomplished what they wanted. At the same time, Amy seems to clearly indicate that the door is open. She says that the idea of doing more has to go out into the universe and she adds that whatever happens, happens.\nAmy and Dan do have a new Amazon pilot in development, so it seems to be rather up in the air whether they would even be able to do more Gilmore Girls for Netflix if an order came together. Fans know what this show is like without Sherman-Palladino and Palladino, so keeping them in the mix is surely critical. Of course, the big question is whether the key stars would be available and willing to come back for more, as there is no show without Rory, Lorelei, and some of the other central figures. Cast members had a blast with this revival, and almost everybody from the original show was incorporated to some degree. If the show were to continue, however, not everybody would need to be involved and that could make another season a bit more feasible to orchestrate.\nOk, LET'S DO THIS! \nRETWEET to show the world we need more #GilmoreGirls episodes! Do it! ❄️????☀️???? pic.twitter.com/wjfALtFvwz \n— Gilmore Girls Daily (@TalkFastGilmore) November 26, 2016 \n\nSo far, Alexis Bledel, Lauren Graham, and Kelly Bishop, who play Rory, Lorelei, and Emily, remain unattached to new projects. Matt Czuchry, who plays Logan, also seems to be available, but Scott Peterson, who plays Luke, does have a few things on his plate. Despite that, he had previously indicated that he’d be open to doing more. Milo Ventimiglia, who plays Jess, is a part of the ensemble cast of NBC’s This Is Us right now. However, many could see how it would be possible for him to do both shows should he be interested, and people can’t help but think that any additional chapters of Gilmore Girls have to include more Jess.\nE! News caught up to both Bledel and Graham at the Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premiere and asked them their thoughts on doing more episodes. Alexis noted that there are no plans at the moment for more, detailing that the cast was grateful to have had the chance to do these four new chapters. Of course, many suspect that Netflix was waiting to see how this four-part revival did before broaching the idea of doing more. Based on the chatter online, it seems that fans would embrace the opportunity to see more from these characters.\nRory and her boys ???? \nLogan 4ever followed by Rory by herself then Season 1 Dean\nThen ok if nothing else, give her Jess #GilmoreGirls pic.twitter.com/Ns8G9wTFLC \n— Paula (@polamars) November 17, 2016 \n\nAlexis notes that it wouldn’t feel right to do more episodes just to do more episodes and she says that there would need to be a “really great reason” to continue on with the series. For her part, Graham teased that given the last four words, the answer about continuing should seem rather obvious. Bishop pondered whether Emily would be satisfied where she ended up in the long-term, which would seem to indicate that she’s open to a return as well. In addition, Czuchry noted that it’s a great ending if it all stops now, but he added that it’ll be another great ride if there is more.\nShould Rory, Lorelei, Emily, Logan, Luke, and the others reconvene for more now that the revival delivered its shocking ending that has generated so much buzz? What did you think of those final four words, and would you tune in to more Gilmore Girls if Netflix and those with the series come together for additional chapters beyond A Year in the Life ?\n[Featured image by Alberto E.

      "text": "Spoiler alert: Do not read if you haven’t watched “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” on Netflix.\nNetflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\" revival (theoretically) had one major purpose: to provide closure to fans who wanted to see how creator Amy Sherman-Palladino envisioned the end of the series, given that she exited the original show before the final season in 2006.\nNow that we've watched the revival, which was released Friday, we only have one response to the idea of \"closure\": LOL. We have even more questions now - and not only because of that bombshell final scene.\n1) Why did Rory and Logan start that ridiculous affair?\nApparently at some point in the last 10 years, Logan forgave Rory for turning down his proposal before college graduation, and she forgave him for proposing in front of her entire family. Then they started a torrid affair, even though Logan is engaged to a French heiress named Odette, and Rory is dating a lame guy named Paul.\nRory and Logan always had great chemistry, but why would they adopt a \"when we're together, we're together, and when we're not, we're not\" policy? It didn't work when they tried to be \"no strings attached\" at Yale, and there's no way it would work while Logan is engaged and Rory has a boyfriend. And, honestly, they both acted a little too casual about the fact that they were cheating on their significant others.\n2) Who is the father of Rory's baby?\nWhen you end a show with a main character saying \"I'm pregnant,\" this is a pretty obvious question. So is the father Logan? Paul? The guy in the Wookiee costume? (Probably not, based on timing.) The audience will always wonder, which we suppose is the whole point of such a maddening ending.\n3) Why did Rory think her mother would be excited about the \"Gilmore Girls\" book?\nIn the midst of a career crisis, Rory decides to write a book based on her and Lorelai's unique life and relationship. Great idea, except Rory had to know that her mother would be upset by this plan. Why would Lorelai want her story, one filled with a lot of deeply personal situations (teenage pregnancy, estrangement from parents, etc.) on display for the whole world?\nMOST READ ENTERTAINMENT NEWS THIS HOUR\nNaturally, Lorelai refuses to give her blessing for the book. Rory is furious. She vents to her best friend, Lane, and is completely flummoxed by Lorelai's reaction. \"She totally freaked out over a book,\" Rory complains. \"She knows I'm a writer, she knows everything is fodder.\"\nDoes Rory actually believe that nonsense? It seemed out of character for her to not even consider Lorelai's perspective - which, by the way, is completely understandable.\n4) What's going to happen with the book?\nOf course, Lorelai ultimately (reluctantly) gives her blessing anyway, and jokes that she'll just sue Rory if she doesn't like the finished product. So is \"The Gilmore Girls\" going to become a best-seller? Oh, sorry, just \"Gilmore Girls\" - as Lorelai tells Rory, \"Drop the 'the.' It's cleaner.\" Maybe that \"Social Network\" reference means Rory is going to be the next Mark Zuckerberg.\n5) What will happen with Christopher?\nWe were wondering if Christopher, Rory's father and Lorelai's first love, would make an appearance. Then, all of a sudden, there he was, working at the family business, still extremely rich. He gets a brief scene as Rory pays him a visit, and asks him how he felt about Lorelai raising her alone. It sounds like research for her book, but she may also want advice about her own pregnancy situation.\nWe also find out Christopher stays far, far away from the about-to-be-happily-married Luke and Lorelai. Will he ever return to mess things up for Lorelai again?\n6) How will Emily do in Nantucket?\nRealizing she no longer wanted to live in her Hartford mansion without Richard, Emily packs everything up and moves to Nantucket, where she lives in a gorgeous house on the ocean and volunteers at a whaling museum. Nope, not the ending we would have predicted for the queen of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR), but it was worth it to see her lose it and yell \"bull---!\" so many times during her last DAR meeting, finally sick of the society life.\n7) Will Paris and Doyle get back together?\nIt was a little heartbreaking that this dysfunctional yet weirdly perfect couple got a divorce, even though Doyle is now a screenwriter, in a nice nod to Danny Strong's actual career. Frankly, the way Paris and Doyle interact as a divorced couple (in front of Rory, who briefly steps in to babysit their kids) isn't too different from how they acted when they were together, so ... you never know.\n8) Will Lane and Zach ever get out of Stars Hollow?\nPoor Lane. Rory's best friend was once on the road to being a rock 'n' roll star. Now, she's still stuck in Stars Hollow working at her mom's antique store and looking after her rambunctious 9-year-old twins. Sure, she and her husband, Zach, still play in their band, but Zach is also stuck in a crushingly boring office job. Will they ever live their musical dreams on the road?\n9) What will happen to the Dragonfly Inn?\nThat quick scene with Melissa McCarthy, reprising her role as Lorelai's best friend, chef Sookie St. James, was a cruel tease in the fourth episode. She and Lauren Graham are hilarious together, so it's too bad that McCarthy's movie star schedule didn't leave her more time to come back for the revival.\nWill Sookie ever quit her fancy farm (?) gig and come back? Will Michel really take that job in New York? Either way, Lorelai is determined to expand the Dragonfly, even using money in her father's will (originally set aside for Luke to franchise his diner) to open a second location in town. Soon, maybe the Dragonfly will be the place Jennifer Lawrence stays when she comes to Stars Hollow.\n10) Are Rory and Jess destined to be together?\nHmmm. While Rory definitively ended up alone in the final episode, we saw Jess steal that longing glance at her right before Luke and Lorelai's wedding. He gave Rory the idea to write the \"Gilmore Girls\" book, so it's likely he'll be back in the picture.\nRELATED STORIES:\nRory Gilmore's long road to ... nowhere\n'Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life' review: Overstuffed, but warm and reassuring\nFive reasons the 'Gilmore Girls' revival needed Melissa McCarthy\n'Gilmore Girls': 7 must-watch episodes of the original series\nCheck out the latest movie reviews from Michael Phillips and the Chicago Tribune.\nCheck out reviews for all new music releases from Tribune music critic Greg Kot.\n Lauren Graham",

      "text": "17 minutes ago \nWarning: major spoilers ahead for the Gilmore Girls revival on Netflix. \nThe four-part revival of Gilmore Girls was one of the most highly-anticipated TV events of 2016. For fans who have been waiting years to see more of Lorelai and Rory Gilmore, November 25 was Gilmore Girls Day rather than Black Friday. The episodes brought back an awful lot of the most unforgettable faces from the original run of Gilmore Girls , and the finale delivered on the promise that the last four words would blow the minds of fans everywhere. Indeed, the last episode ended on a cliffhanger as Rory revealed to her mom that she's actually pregnant. \nThe cliffhanger of Rory's pregnancy was met with a variety of reactions on social media. For some folks, the baby bombshell meant that the cycle of Gilmore ladies in Stars Hollow is destined to continue. For others, it meant a lack of closure and a letdown after all of Lorelai's efforts to give Rory a different life. We scoured the web for some of the most impassioned responses to the Gilmore Girls' finale twist. Grab yourself a cup of coffee and take a look! Let's start with a good one: Full. Freakin. Circle. — Gilmore Girls (@GilmoreGirrls) November 28, 2016 \nRory's reveal at the end of the four episodes of the revival felt like a perfect conclusion to some viewers. The pregnancy means that the story of the Gilmore girls isn't truly done, even if we don't get to watch the next chapters with the next generation. There's no saying at this point if we'll get another batch of episodes; still, at least we know that Rory and Lorelai have plenty of family adventures ahead of them. Still, not everyone was happy with the ending... Is anyone else PISSED about that @GilmoreGirls ending?!!! There's going to be more right?! Tell me yes. Tell. Me. Yes. cc: @netflix — Ashlee Holmes (@ashleeholmes) November 28, 2016 \nFor other fans, it just wasn't right that they had to wait the better part of a decade for closure, only for the revival to end on a ginormous cliffhanger. The final four words didn't reveal the father of Rory's baby. If Gilmore Girls is done for good after these four episodes, we may never know. And since Daniel and Amy Sherman-Palladino haven't confirmed there will be more episodes, this could be the end. Finally finished Gilmore Girls. I will ignore the final scene and the show is done for me. ???? — (@TinaDayton) November 28, 2016 \nOf course, there is a third option beyond happiness and anger at the ending. Viewers could always just choose to pretend that the revival ended before those final four words. In that bizarre reality, Rory isn't actually pregnant. The new episodes stand well enough on their own without the cliffhanger, so what's the harm in completely ignoring it if that makes the ending easier to handle? Logan got Rory pregnant and Jess is still friendzoned #GilmoreGirlsRevival #GilmoreGirls #TeamLogan pic.twitter.com/jNSxZeKEFd — (@iheartjaxtara) November 25, 2016 \nFans of the Logan/Rory relationship probably aren't ignoring the last four words. The finale didn't explicitly reveal who is the father of Rory's baby, but all signs point toward Logan as the dad. If we never get any more episodes, Team Logan may be able to claim that they won the day. whatever man that longing look jess gave rory that's how he got her pregnant you can't convince me otherwise #GilmoreGirls — ????mirna???? (@allthemims) November 25, 2016 \nFans of Jess/Rory weren't necessarily deterred by the hints that Rory is having her baby with Logan. The finale never ruled out someone else as the father, and the revival proved that Jess, at least, can still bring the smolder when it comes to Rory. Team Jess may have hit a setback, but they haven't hung on for all these years just to give up over an ambiguous ending. At least they can say that they beat Team Dean . Even fans who were OK with the ending seem hellbent to wait for more: Waiting for the news if there'll be a second season for the @GilmoreGirls revival #GilmoreGirlsRevival pic.twitter.com/0qSuVcBKL3 — Lauren (@Lauren_Orderr) November 27, 2016 \nNow, the waiting game has begun. Will we get a second new season on Netflix, or were the four episodes all that we're ever going to get for closure? Have we seen the last of Stars Hollow forever? Will we never find out what happens next for Lorelai, Rory, and whichever strapping young man has gotten her pregnant? Was this really it? I THINK I'M GONNA USE THIS GIF A LOT @GilmoreGirls pic.twitter.com/pdK9jSs3j0 — kate is EMO bc GG (@kateisweird) November 28, 2016 \nAll in all, one of the sentiments that most Gilmore Girls fans seem to have in common is that the final four words just weren't enough for a series finale. The pregnancy twist was definitely a big cliffhanger. Some viewers loved it, some hated it, and some are pretending that it didn't happen. We'll have to wait and see if we get more from the series. Hopefully we just won't have to wait another nine years. \nStay tuned to CinemaBlend for the latest news on reboots and revivals for the small screen, and check out our midseason 2017 TV premiere schedule to see what you can catch on TV in the aftermath of Gilmore Girls ' Netflix debut.

      "text": "Warning: Spoilers ahead.\nNetflix&apos;s highly-anticipated Gilmore Girls revival— Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life —finally made its debut over Thanksgiving weekend, and fans are in heaven. The four-part epic is a coffee-scented nostalgia parade that answers hot-burning questions, but still leaves us yearning for more. (Um, those last four words, anybody?) The small-town charm that made us fall in love with the original series is present in spades, and that&apos;s comforting.\nBut also infuriating. The writing in the OG Gilmore Girls series is colorful and fun, yes, but, at times, it&apos;s also dated and filled with jokes that don&apos;t exactly land today. We live in an era that (rightfully) rejects offensive and downright mean jokes, and I thought Amy Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino would take this into consideration when they wrote Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life .\nBut there in between the delightful Tori Spelling references and saccharine boyfriend reunions are tone-deaf quips about \"gays,\" non-English-speaking folks, and, in two uncomfortable scenes at the pool during the \"Summer\" episode, plus-size people.\n\"Summer\" begins with Lorelai and Rory debating the purpose of pools while sitting at the pool. As they&apos;re talking at a lighting-fast pace, two larger men with exposed stomachs pass by, and Lorelai feels the need to say, \"Belly alert!\" Rory chimes in with \"Holy moly,\" as if she&apos;s never seen plus-size men before in her life. (If she thinks all dudes have rippling six-packs like her emotionally unavailable Logan Huntzberger, she&apos;s in for a world of pain.) But it gets worse: Midway through the episode, the gals are back at the pool with a new batch of body-shaming insults. One unsuspecting man (whom Rory and Lorelai nicknamed \"Back Fat Pat\") warmly goes up to the girls and welcomes Rory back to Stars Hollow, and Rory thanks him by accidentally calling him \"fat\" to his face. In two short scenes, Rory and Lorelai went from my favorite mother-daughter duo to my worst nightmare at the pool.\nBecause I&apos;m overweight. For me, going to the beach or pool is an emotionally harrowing experience; I strategically plan my shirtless moments so I won&apos;t get fat-shamed. I&apos;ll walk to the edge of the pool with my shirt on; then, I&apos;ll quickly rip it off and jump in before anybody can get a good look at my body. And this is on a good day: Most of the time, I&apos;ll just sit with my shirt on, even though I&apos;m burning up and desperately want to swim. It took until the last day of a four-day cruise with my friends for me to gain the courage to go shirtless. I essentially spent $400 to watch other people have fun because I&apos;d rather be sweaty than ridiculed.\nThe source of my fear is comments like Lorelai and Rory&apos;s \"jokes.\" Frankly, their casual bullying took me out of my Stars Hollow bliss. I had trouble fully engaging in the revival after it happened.\nBecause I thought Lorelai and Rory were better than this. They&apos;ve always seemed more concerned with their friends&apos; brains than their waistlines. Take Lorelai&apos;s best friend, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy). For much of the series, Miss Patty was curvy. Would Rory and Lorelai body shame these women if they saw them in swimsuits? After watching these scenes in the revival, I can&apos;t definitively say \"no.\"\nAnd that sucks. For me, the revival—which I&apos;d been looking forward to for months—was spoiled by these thoughtless scenes. Not only that, they made me strongly dislike two characters I once revered. I&apos;m not the only fan on this train. Just look these pool scene reactions on Twitter:\nhttps://twitter.com/jojothejo/status/803258318856790016\nhttps://twitter.com/AshKessler/status/803035916625448960\nhttps://twitter.com/coolbreeeze_/status/802511371392970752\nhttps://twitter.com/thelizakate/status/802244765970362368\nSMH. I&apos;d say, \"Do better next time, Gilmore Girls , \" but there might not be a next time. This could be the last impression I have of the show, and it&apos;s not a good one.",

      "text": "We have some news for you out of Hollywood today.\nSome HBO, Netflix, Food Network and ABC. Check it out!\nHBO's Big Little Lies has a launch date. The upcoming star-studded limited series starring Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman and Shailene Woodley will premiere on Sunday, February 19 at 9/8c.\nThe darkly comedic series based on Lian Moriarty's bestselling book of the same name tells the tale of three mothers of first-graders whose seemingly perpetual lives unravel to the point of murder.\nBig Little Lies is written by David E. Kelley and costars Alexander Skarsgard, Laura Dern, Adam Scott, Zoe Kravitz, James Tupper and Jeffrey Nordling.\nQuantico is on the move!\nRight after the fall finale this Sunday, The Quan2co Writers Room Tweeted that the series will resume Quantico Season 2 on ABC Monday, January 23 at 10/9c.\nWe don't know if that means freshman Conviction will have aired its full run of 13 episodes, if it will be on the move, as well, or held for a later date.\nNetflix has released two photos of it's upcoming series Santa Clarita Diet, starring Drew Barrymore and Timothy Olyphant as husband and wife realtors Shiela and Joel Hammond.\nThey're leading vaguely discontented lives in the L.A. suburb of Santa Clarita with their teenaged daughter Abby (Liv Hewson), until Sheila goes through a dramatic change sending their lives down a road of death and destruction...but in a good way.\nThe dark comedy will drop worldwide on February 3, 2017, only on Netflix.\nGood news for foodies out there!\nFood Network is planning on bringing back another iteration of its long running series Iron Chef America, which was based upon the original Iron Chef From Japan.\nThe new series would be called Iron Chef Gauntlet, and as a fan of both original Iron Chef series, I can only hope that by adding \"Gauntlet\" it means chefs will be really be given tough foods to infuse into their menus.\nIron Chef America had Battle Bread, Pasta, Thanksgiving, Cheese, Sausage and all kinds of easy peasy items, while the original Iron Chef used to throw really difficult delicacies at their chefs. That was fun stuff!\nCommentator Alton Brown is set to return as host and mater of ceremonies and the target launch date is second quarter 2017.\nView Slideshow: 36 Reasons We're Indebted To The Small Screen ",

      "text": "New on Netflix in December: ‘Barry,’ ‘Captain America: Civil War,’ ‘Fuller House’  56 pm Here’s Netflix’s list of what’s arriving — and what’s leaving — on the service in December 2016. Share story Sean Axmaker Special to The Seattle Times \nNetflix continues to expand its original programming with new TV shows, movies and documentaries. Debuting exclusively on Netflix in December are the new movies “Barry,” an original drama about young Barack Obama at Columbia University; and the war-movie-turned-science-fiction-thriller “Spectral” with James Badge Dale, Emily Mortimer and Bruce Greenwood. \nNew series include the time-travel drama “Travelers” with Eric McCormack; the animated crime comedy “Pacific Heat” ; the miniseries “Call Me Francis,” about the life of the man who would become Pope Francis in 2013; and the animated series “Trollhunters” for kids. Among the new nonfiction shows are “White Rabbit Project,” which puts weird events and unusual phenomenon under the microscope, and “Captive,” which investigates real-life cases of kidnapping and hostage taking. There also are new original shows from Israel ( “Fauda” ), Spain ( “Four Seasons in Havana” ), France ( “Versailles” ) and Britain ( “Crazyhead” ). But perhaps the most anticipated show coming in December is the second season of the hit sitcom “Fuller House,” complete with a seasonal Christmas episode. \nNew films coming include “ Captain America: Civil War ” (2016), an Avengers film in everything but name; the thriller “The Good Neighbor” with James Caan and Logan Miller; the documentary “Rats,” about the history of rodent infestation in cities around the world; and the Chinese thriller “Phantom of the Theater.” \nOlder titles include such favorites as “Beverly Hills Cop” and “National Lampoon’s Animal House,” and the classic drama “Compulsion” with Orson Welles.

      "text": "\nMythBusters ended its run earlier this year, after fifteen seasons on the Discovery Channel. But if you still haven’t quite gotten over that loss, then Netflix may have just the thing for you. The streaming service has unveiled the first trailer for White Rabbit Project , which looks basically like MythBusters minus Jamie Hyneman and Adam Savage. Instead, the former Build Team — Grant Imahara , Kari Byron , and Tory Belleci — gets to be front and center this time.\nWatch the White Rabbit Project trailer below. \nWhite Rabbit Project Trailer \nWhen White Rabbit Project was announced a couple months ago, it was described as “ MythBusters in Wonderland.” The promise was that it would send the trio “down the rabbit hole of the internet” to investigate “weird and wonderful events from pop culture, science, and history.” As with MythBusters , the hosts will conduct experiments, builds, and tests to get to the truth behind urban legends and historical anecdotes. And as with MythBusters , it sounds like things will get pretty strange. Just in the trailer, you’ve got the gang staging a jailbreak, blowing things up, and making remarks like, “I’ve never sexed a cockroach either.” I don’t even want to know the context for that last one.\nSo yeah, White Rabbit Project looks kind of familiar, but that seems to be its charm. It should hit the sweet spot for people who want something that’s basically exactly like MythBusters , only not a rerun. Imahara, Byron, and Belleci have clearly built up a wonderful rapport from their years together on MythBusters , and it should be fun to see them team up again.\nAll episodes of White Rabbit Project will be on Netflix December 9 .\nThe coolest tech. The weirdest weapons. The craziest escapes. Three science-loving sleuths put them under the microscope.\nKari Byron, Tory Belleci and Grant Imahara rank history’s greatest inventions, heists and more in this series from the producers of “MythBusters.”\nThe post Netflix’s ‘White Rabbit Project’ Trailer Reunites the ‘MythBusters’ Build Team appeared first on /Film .\n",

      "text": "Suzanne Hanover/Netflix \nWarning: Spoilers ahead if you haven't watched Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\nAmong the revelations promised in Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls\" revival, the one about Michel's sexuality was pretty unexpected — even for the actor who plays the character.\n\"I found out about it when I read the script,\" Yanic Truesdale told Business Insider recently. \nTruesdale said that he had never spoken to \"Gilmore Girls\" creator Amy Sherman-Palladino about his character being gay — even just to discuss the character's backstory, which can be helpful for an actor. \nFor years, fans speculated on the uptight, easily annoyed Frenchman's sexuality. The character's romantic life was never shown, nor discussed during the original series. But during the first part of Netflix's \"Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life,\" we finally learned that he's not only gay, but married to a man.\n\"People have been speculating since the beginning of the show if he was gay or not,\" Truesdale said of Michel. \"Some fans thought I had a secret crush on Lorelai. I mean, everyone has their own take on him.\" \nIn the revival, Michel's personal life is an important piece of information. He and his husband, whom we don't actually meet, were looking to adopt a child and Michel had to wonder about his ability to provide for the new member of the family, as well as whether there was anywhere to move up at Lorelai's (Lauren Graham) Stars Hollow hotel, the Dragonfly Inn. \n\"I think it was more satisfying for me, this time around, because we touched on some of his personal aspects of life,\" Truesdale said. \"You know, the fact that he’s married, the children issue, the crossroads with his work, and having to make big decisions in his life made me connect with him at a deeper level. And that was great. I’ve always wanted to have more personal stuff for him, because it’s satisfying to go there for an actor. So I’m happy about it.\" \nEven so, Truesdale said that knowing the character is gay didn't affect how he portrayed Michel.\n\"To me, it didn’t change anything either way because Michel is a character that’s never been defined by his sexuality,\" he told us. \"Mostly, he's defined by his irritants or being French and everything that entails. This is the foundation that I’ve worked with, so either way, for me whatever his love life was didn’t affect my choices as an actor.\" \nNOW WATCH: The 7 best TV shows on Netflix you've probably never heard of \n",

      "text": "Sign up for our Newsletters . Daily Edition What DirecTV Now Means for Hollywood, Netflix, Pay TV 5:59 AM PST 11/29/2016 by Georg Szalai COMMENTS Courtesy of Getty Images Brad Bentley, executive vp and chief marketing officer, AT&T Entertainment Group, at the DirecTV Now launch event One Wall Street observer says the new offer could mitigate pay TV subscriber erosion and, along with other expected streaming video service launches, be positive for media stock valuations. \nAT&T on Monday afternoon unveiled pricing and bundling details of its much-anticipated DirecTV Now streaming video service, which launches Wednesday for as little as $35 per month, and Wall Street on Tuesday morning started discussing what it will mean for content companies, Netflix and the broader pay TV industry. \nRBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall in a report asked if the streaming service was \"good for media?\" DirecTV has unveiled \"a potentially great product with Now, in our view, that leverages having some of the best programming costs in the business due to scale, as we think DirecTV's programming costs are some 20 percent-30 percent below the industry average,\" he said. \"This may force competitor products to come down to DirecTV's price point even if their wholesale costs are much higher.\" \nThis would not only be good news for consumers, but will \"as a result likely mitigate pay TV sub erosion, though by how much is impossible to know just yet,\" Cahall argued. \"On the flipside, we think some of those subs may come from smaller linear multichannel video programming distributors, and virtual multichannel video programming distributors' churn would be higher.\" \nConcluded the analyst: \"We see the mitigation of TV sub erosion as THE biggest issue for media investors. We see DirecTV Now and future launches as constructive to media valuations.\" \nTelsey Advisory Group analyst Thomas Eagan said Tuesday that he also remains bullish on pay TV companies and doesn't expect \"material cannibalization yet from DirecTV Now.\" \nDiscussing its effect on competitors, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Ryvicker wrote: \"We view this product as competition for the Slings and PlayStation Vues of the world rather than for the core cable customer.\" She concluded it would be \"no real threat\" for cable operators. \nEagan similarly wrote in a report that the new service \"could compete with [Dish's] SlingTV,\" while \"Netflix [is] still a complement.\" He explained: \"While we estimate the number of broadband-only video households grows to 5 million this year, it's still relatively small and price elastic to support multiple OTT players. We, therefore, expect share shift from within OTT services. We see DISH's SlingTV (the only other live TV streaming service) as vulnerable due to the streaming issues that have lowered retention. Conversely, we see a neutral to possibly favorable impact to Netflix. With its original programming and low price, it remains a complement to a pay TV or streamed base package.\" \nWhich consumers will DirecTV Now appeal to? \"Priced at between $30-$50 per month, the cost with broadband could total $80-$100 per month yielding nominal savings versus pay TV for households that watch a lot of TV, especially with only 1-2 streams,\" Eagan said. \nCahall said DirecTV Now's starting price point of $35 per month should help it make a statement compared to competitors from launch. \"This offer, while potentially not money-making on a per-sub basis, should help Now attract critical mass in subs early-on,\" he wrote. \"The unusually low on-sale $35 per month price point [promotion] for the $60 per month package suggests to us that AT&T has more business in mind. For one, DirecTV Now will stream free on AT&T mobile subs, suggesting gaining mobile subscribers is a key cross-sell strategy of Now. Secondly, we suspect that AT&T hopes to graduate Now subs up to premium DirecTV packages over time at far more accretive price points, long-term contracts etc.\" \nOverall, he argued that AT&T and other companies planning streaming video service launches are using content as a cross-seller. Peers \"will also have additional services unique to their respective businesses they will seek to promote and cross-sell with, including Hulu (media now owning some distribution), YouTube (adding Google/YouTube users) and potentially Amazon and Apple,\" Cahall said. \"The 'content as a cross-sell' model is, In our view, the reason AT&T is paying such a premium for Time Warner.\"",

      "text": "You know the drill: Another month is coming to a close, which means Netflix will be bringing new shows and movies to its slate, while saying goodbye to a few titles. This December's no different, with Netflix's catalogue bidding adieu to a few cult classics (at least Fuller House is coming back for season two!).\nBut you've still got a couple of days before they're gone. Therefore, if you have a spare 10 hours or so, here are six titles — along with the corresponding date they're leaving the streaming service — any binge-watching buff should check out, post haste.\nAmerican Beauty (Dec. 1) Nowadays, Kevin Spacey is best known for his role as President Frank Underwood (is he more terrifying than Donald Trump? Hard to tell!) in Netflix's House of Cards , but Spacey's finest performance might've been in American Beauty . As a family man going through a mid-life crisis, beginning to fantasize about his teenage daughter's friend, it was an indicting reflection of the American white upper-middle class that still feels poignant in 2016.\nSource: Paramount Movies/YouTube Event Horizon (Dec. 1) Event Horizon might not be a critically praised sci-fi film , but it is batshit crazy in the most entertaining way. It lies in the film's conceit, in which a spaceship's crew suddenly vanishes and the rescue team soon discovers that the crew had opened a portal to hell. In doing so, the crew went mad — as does Sam Neill's character on the rescue team — and the imagery was so graphic most of it had to be cut from the film. If you're not afraid of gore, or Sam Neill dissecting people, it's a fun ride through literal hell and back.\nSource: Paramount Movies /YouTube Top Gun (Dec. 1) You need to take the highway to the danger zone at least once with a viewing of Top Gun , the movie starring Tom Cruise that's chock full of cheesy puns, great music and a preposterous amount of testosterone. That testosterone is mostly led through Cruise and fellow pilot Iceman (Val Kilmer), and while Cruise's Maverick seemingly has a love interest in his female flight instructor Charlotte (Kelly McGillis), it's the clear sexual tension between Maverick and Iceman that steals the show.\nSource: Paramount Movies/YouTube Holes (Dec. 5) Before Shia LaBeouf became a sentient Internet meme, he was a budding child actor that began with a lead role in Disney Channel's Even Stevens . But another LaBeouf childhood staple is Holes , the movie adaptation of the Louis Sachar novel of the same name. LaBeouf plays the film's lead, Stanley Yelnats (yes, his last name is Stanley spelled backwards), who spends his time at a juvenile detention camp literally digging holes for the warden. Unfortunately, it also spawned an awful Holes-theme song that never should be revisited, but we'll leave the link below.\nSource: Walt Disney Pictures/YouTube The Da Vinci Code (Dec. 14) The first of three films starring Tom Hanks as Robert Langdon is perhaps the best in the Dan Brown -adapted franchise, which isn't saying much . Still, The Da Vinci Code is entertaining viewing if you don't take the premise as seriously as the movie does — hint: It's about the Illuminati .\nSource: SonyPicsHomeEntWorld/YouTube Spy Kids (Dec. 27) OK, so the Spy Kids sequels left a lot to be desired, but the original still holds up in all its campy glory. The children of the best spies in the world, tasked with saving their spy parents by becoming spies themselves? That's a fun premise for a kids movie, led by one of Hollywood's most entertaining action directors, Robert Rodriguez. It doesn't leave Netflix until Dec. 27, so it's a great movie to check out around Christmas.\nSource: Movieclips Trailer Vault/YouTube",

      "text": "\nThis past weekend, Netflix hosted the Gilmore Girls revival, featuring the triumphant return of co-creators Amy Sherman-Palladino and Daniel Palladino, who finally got the chance to tell the ending of the story that they intended to tell back in 2006. The wife-and-husband duo crafted six seasons of much-loved television together, but after a contract dispute, the seventh and final season of Gilmore Girls had to trundle on without them. The show did its best, but even in its strongest moments, season 7 feels more like a piece of fan-fiction than the real deal.\nYou’d think, then, that the revival would be a satisfying return to form for Gilmore Girls . In many ways, it is. The four-part series, which most die-hard fans probably watched in one go this past Thanksgiving weekend, features a lot of laughs and plenty of tearjerker moments, but it’s also got some very bizarre problems, mostly due to the fact that the show’s denouement would’ve made a lot more sense if everyone involved were … y’know … ten years younger. Roughly.\nGilmore Girls ‘ return has also forced us all to face the larger question of whether the quaint world of Stars Hollow even looks familiar to us anymore, let alone comforting, in 2016. Lorelai and Rory were always self-involved anti-heroines, but their observational awareness tended to bounce off the surface of Stars Hollow’s unflappable charms. But, as written in 2016, their jaded attitudes—and the unfailing subservience of the small town that is inexplicably obsessed with them—comes across as a lot more bizarre, in the post-ironic world of 2016 media.\nThis tension is encapsulated in a bizarre ten-minute musical segment that occurs in episode three, an episode that has swiftly earned the reputation as the designated worst episode of the four-part series. It’s worth noting that while Amy Sherman-Palladino wrote the first and last episodes of the four-parter, Daniel Palladino wrote episodes two and three. Episode three in particular has all the hallmarks of a Daniel episode: the jokes told by the titular Girls tend to have a crueler knife-twist to them, and the plot machinations are relentlessly quirky—particularly the now-infamous Stars Hollow: The Musical .\nDaniel Palladino has long been a fan of the “musical episode” on Gilmore Girls , or at least, of including a show-within-a-show as a narrative device. In season three, episode 14 , he wrote Miss Patty’s one-woman extravaganza, directed by Kirk (of course) and titled, “Buckle Up, I’m Patty.” In season 5, episode 18 , we got to see a production helmed by Taylor—a museum about Stars Hollow’s oft-retconned past, acted out by mannequins rather than people. In the show’s sixth season, in episode 5 , we watched Lorelai attend one of Miss Patty’s dance students’ recitals. Our heroine voiced her mocking discomfort with musical theatre even back then, as children danced around her singing “Magic to Do” from Pippin and throwing confetti in her face. These are all Daniel Palladino episodes, and his love-hate relationship with the theatre is palpable in each of them—particularly with the idea of embarrassingly genuine community theatre projects.\nIt’s not as though Amy Sherman-Palladino doesn’t share the sentiment, though, at least on some level. The pair of them co-wrote a season five episode about a Stars Hollow war reenactment, which also has some similarities in structure to these other stories. It provides an opportunity for Lorelai to play the canny observer, the audience stand-in who points and laughs at the earnestness of these small-town actors, but that mockery is usually done with a sense of love and a sense of inclusion. Lorelai may mock Stars Hollow, but it’s also a place that welcomed her without question, no matter how many snarky asides she makes.\nAgain, Stars Hollow itself represents a pre-irony, early 2000s level of earnestness that seems even more bizarre to watch now, and it also feels uniquely unrealistic and theatrical, even by 2000s television standards. Sometimes extras play more than one role of the same name, and the sets of Gilmore Girls never looked entirely real; it always felt like a studio backlot, with every location around the corner from every other location. Emily Gilmore supposedly lives in Hartford, and Rory eventually ends up at Yale in New Haven; somehow, even though those two locations are an hour away in real life (or longer, depending on traffic), on the show, they’re all “about thirty minutes away” (usually less), and the fictional town of Stars Hollow is always in the center of it all. In other words, it’s always felt like a set for a play rather than a set for a TV show. Stars Hollow has always had markers of the surreal.\nBy adding in the plays within a play, and putting the affable background townspeople of Stars Hollow into the roles, we are invited to laugh both at and with the absurdity that is Stars Hollow. But … that sense of familiarity is gone from Stars Hollow: The Musical , since the stars of this musical aren’t from Stars Hollow at all. This is not an independent film made by Kirk, nor a song sung by Miss Patty and Babette. This is a musical starring people we don’t recognize at all—cameos by real-life musical theatre blockbusters.\nSpecifically, the musical stars musical theatre heavy-hitter Sutton Foster as an actress who plays multiple roles—a woman who represents every woman in Stars Hollow, throughout the ages. A woman around whom the entire town revolves. Christian Borle co-stars in the musical as an endlessly-changing love interest and/or narrative device; he is also a famous musical theatre actor in his own right, who used to be married to Sutton Foster, and apparently, the two of them used to watch Gilmore Girls together . I mean, I know Gilmore Girls loves obscure references, but the meta-text here is buried pretty deep, even by Palladino standards.\nAllow me to explain the joke: Sutton Foster’s character serves as a clear stand-in for Lorelai herself. After all, Foster starred in Amy Sherman-Palladino’s Bunheads , another TV show that deserved a more conclusive ending and never got one. Bunheads was also about a strained maternal relationship, featuring Kelly Bishop not as Emily Gilmore but as Fanny Flowers, the mother-in-law to Sutton Foster’s character. The dynamic was different in some ways, but the parallels to Gilmore Girls could not be denied, even at the time. Fans tend to view Bunheads as a spiritual successor, with some rejecting the show as not quite right. It’s a similar story, but with just enough elements changed to feel out-of-body and surreal. (Sort of like a certain ten-minute musical I might mention.)\nIn the context of Stars Hollow: The Musical , then, it makes sense that Sutton Foster would play the woman around whom the town revolves: the Lorelai Gilmore, if you will. It also makes sense that Lorelai, and the Netflix viewers, would find the experience of watching this musical to be bizarre and jarring rather than entertaining. As Sutton Foster sings her heart out and endures a painfully unfunny Hamilton tribute, Lorelai cringes in the darkness of the theatre. She gets shushed whenever she tries to crack one-liners; she ends up sitting in silence, taking notes on her notepad and grimacing at the embarrassment of this show.\nInsofar as I can glean any sort of message from Stars Hollow: The Musical , it seems to be: don’t try to romanticize the past. The show’s opening scene, which Taylor wrote in tribute to the plays of Edward Albee (e.g., Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf? ), culminates with this haunting quote: “I wish I was in the past. It’s better than any future with you!” The rest of the show does indeed take place in the past; the next song features settlers building Stars Hollow, which apparently requires them to dig up a river and move it (?!). The following song, set in a “revolutionary time,” includes a joke about getting married to your relatives, plus lines like this: “We’ll have 14 kids, and hope that three will survive.”\nAll of these unnerving lines are juxtaposed with Lorelai’s horrified facial expression, and the joyful pleased expressions of everyone else watching the show. Next up, we’ve got the Industrial Revolution and the worst rapping you’ve ever heard (the Hamilton parody). Then, the show skips ahead to the present day, where Sutton Foster sings to us that “the world is a terrible place,” and then she and Christian Borle list off a series of small inconveniences, like “tiny airplane seats” and “what restaurants charge for wine.” The worst thing they can come up with? “Putin.” But don’t worry: Stars Hollow is immune to all of those scary external problems, or so this song seems to promise, as the actors repeat “hollow” in haunting harmonies. “What’s there not to love about the town of Stars Hollow?”\nThen, who could forget the musical’s final song, which is just a cover of ABBA’s “Waterloo”? “The history book on the shelf / is always repeating itself … Waterloo, couldn’t escape if I wanted to.”\n\nAfter the excruciating ten minutes end, Lorelai listens as the rest of the town lavishes praise upon Taylor’s musical. She is the sole voice of dissent, pointing out that they shouldn’t be ripping off Hamilton (Taylor argues that it’s more of an homage). She also says, in passing, that the leading lady sure does seem to have a revolving door of dudes. (As for whether that’s intended to be a commentary on Lorelai and Rory’s own boyfriends … well, it’s hard to say, but this show has never been entirely kind to its own heroines on that score.) Stars Hollow: The Musical is, nominally, a reflection of what Taylor believes is important about the town, but Lorelai can’t seem to get past the fact that it’s not right. Or perhaps the problem is that the musical doesn’t really matter. It’s just a show, right?\nAnd so is Gilmore Girls , obviously. If this recreation of Stars Hollow doesn’t feel quite right, well, perhaps that’s because it isn’t. It’s not just surreal, it’s actively absurd—one might even go so far as to call it The Theatre of the Absurd . This isn’t Edward Albee so much as Samuel Beckett and Eugène Ionesco. Like an absurdist play, Stars Hollow: The Musical repeats mundane facts over and over until they become meaningless; its self-referential attitude is simultaneously boring and jarring. It’s actively hard to pay attention to it.\nBut the world of Stars Hollow in 2016 is absurd. It’s Waiting for Godot levels of absurd. It’s absurd that the entirety of Stars Hollow seems to have been encased in a jello mold for the past ten years. Why didn’t Lorelai and Luke get married before now, or discuss children? Because there were no Palladinos to write the dialogue for them. Why didn’t Rory write a book before now? Why did her entire career flounder? Why is she still entranced with the same boys that she met ten years ago, with seemingly no change at all? Why is everything exactly the same? Is that comforting, or is it alienating?\nI’m not sure. I think it might be both. At the end of episode three, when Rory tells her mother that she’s planning to write a book about their life together, we already know what it will be called. We know the title long before we see Rory type it out. Lorelai reacts with horror at the idea of having to read her own story back again—at having to see herself on stage, on screen, on the page. But, as Rory points out, it’s not just Lorelai’s story—it’s Rory’s story. They both have the same story, and as the revival’s finale shows us with its last four words, that cyclical fate is apparently inescapable.\nBut, as the musical says, what’s there not to love about the town of Stars Hollow?\n(images via Netflix screencaps)\nWant more stories like this?

      "text": "Reviews for the latest episodes of the TV show “Gilmore Girls” continue to be mostly positive following the Nov. 25 release of Netflix’s “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life.\"\nThe show, which stars Lauren Graham, Alexis Bledel, and Kelly Bishop as three generations of women in the Gilmore family, aired on the WB, then the CW, for seven seasons. The final season was produced without creator Amy Sherman-Palladino. But Ms. Sherman-Palladino returned for the new Netflix episodes, which debuted nine years after the original show went off the air. The Netflix episodes consist of four hour-and-a-half installments and feature the return of almost every original “Gilmore” character.\nTV critics have generally responded positively to the “Gilmore” revival, with Newsday writer Verne Gay calling the Netflix revival “a triumphant return.”\nRecommended: The 20 best TV sitcoms of all time – readers' choice “Engineered – or rather re-engineered – for an emotional wallop as much as for laughs, this is a big-hearted, generous, deeply felt gift to fans who years ago were left wondering about all the what-might-have-beens,” Mr. Gay wrote. Even new viewers, Gay says, should \"dive right in. The themes are universal, the water warm and welcoming.”\nThe 20 best TV sitcoms of all time – readers' choice 11/29 David Sims of The Atlantic was also pleased, writing that “Gilmore” is “a rare TV revival that works … the show renews the witty spirit that has helped it endure since it went off the air. But the series is also unafraid to grapple with how much time has passed – and the inertia that needed to be overcome to recapture the magic.”\nDaniel D’Addario of Time , however, is one writer who wasn’t won over, writing that the program is “disappointing … It’s not a throwback– it’s flat-out anachronistic … over the course of the series, sprawling running times encourage bloat more than they do momentum. Endless wisecracks, some dated but some not, just wither on the vine in scene after endless scene.”\nThe revival has prompted some to wonder if this the end of “Gilmore Girls” or will more episodes be created?\nSherman-Palladino, in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter , was definitively ambiguous. “We really had a very specific journey in our minds and we fulfilled the journey. So to us, this is the piece that we wanted to do. And the whole thought about, 'Is there more, is there more, is there more?' – this has to go out into the universe now. We've got to put this to bed. And then whatever happens, happens.”",

We refuse to do spoilers, so we'll just say that the character of Rory Gilmore (played by Alexis Bledel) uttered four words which were a game changer. Naturally, it left viewers asking if there is more to come. Okay but there's going to be more @GilmoreGirls though, right? Please?\n— Sophie Protheroe (@sophprotheroe) November 29, 2016 There's going to be more #GilmoreGirls right? They can't finish it like that!\n— Coldpolarbear (@coldpolarbear) November 29, 2016 Please tell me there will be more @GilmoreGirls episodes.! A year in the life was a tease I NEED more!\n— WholeLivingHappyLife (@WholelivinHappy) November 29, 2016 Lauren Graham, who plays Lorelai on the show, gave us all a bit of hope that there will be more from Stars Hollow. Read More \"You know the final four words. What do you think?\" Graham told E!. And, at the very least, there will be a book.

      "text": "Warner Bros\nWarning: Spoilers ahead for \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life.\"\nNetflix's revival of \"Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life\" is now officially streaming.\nThe show likely made many fans feel happy and nostalgic — those four last words aside — while also moving the characters forward in a satisfying way.\nThere were also plenty of references to the series that may have gone over your head unless you're a die-hard fan. Keep reading so you can go back and catch them all.\n Let’s start with a classic: \"I smell snow,\" Lorelai tells Rory in the town square. Netflix Fans of the original series know that Lorelai has a keen sense for smelling when snow is about to fall. Lorelai smelling the first snow of the year. Warner Bros. In episode eight of the first season, Lorelai tells Rory how much she loves the snow and that she can smell when it's coming.\nShe also says every good thing that's ever happened to her — her first kiss, Rory's first steps, her best birthday — happened when it was snowing.\nLorelai is worried that celebrity chef Roy Choi is going to burn down the Dragonfly Inn's kitchen. Netflix Lorelai has an ever revolving door of chefs coming in and out as she tries to replace her beloved best friend and the inn's chef, Sookie (Melissa McCarthy), during the revival.\nIn the original series, the inn where Lorelai, Michele, and Sookie worked did burn down. Warner Bros. While working at the Independence Inn, a faulty wire causes a fire to break out and the Inn got shut down.\nIt eventually spurs Lorelai and Sookie to open the Dragonfly Inn together.\nEmily's new maid Berta is actually played by a Stars Hollow favorite. Netflix That's right — Rose Abdoo, who plays Gypsy in the series, also plays Berta! Netflix \"Rose read it for fun in a table read because they hadn't cast it yet, and she was so hilarious they had to double her up,\" Lauren Graham (Lorelai) tweeted about the casting .\nGypsy tells Lorelai to buy a new car after fixing her Jeep Wrangler in \"Spring.\" Netflix Everyone should know by now that Lorelai will never get a new car. Warner Bros. In season seven, Lorelai tries to buy a new car, but discovers that she doesn't like any car but her beloved Jeep.\nThe frustrating process of trying to find a car she likes ends up fixing her friendship with Luke, who ends up convincing Gypsy to install a new engine into her old car.\nThere are also a few Easter eggs from the show at Richard's funeral, including a record Rory gave him. Netflix During the first season, Lorelai isn't sure what to get her father. She asks Rory, who says she got him \"Chuck Berry: Live at the Fillmore.\" Netflix and Wikimedia Commons That album is on a table at the funeral, a touching reminder of Rory's relationship with her grandfather.\nAnd this picture was from the wedding vow renewal episode, which was also the \"Gilmore Girls\" 100th episode. Netflix The episode was called \"Wedding Bell Blues\" and it was a huge hit with critics and a wonderful glimpse into Emily and Richard's marriage. Warner Bros When Emily is Kondo-ing her home, she tells Lorelai: \"I was married for 50 years, half of me is gone.\" Netflix This bit of dialogue is a touching tribute to actor Edward Hermann. Netflix Edward Hermann played Richard Gilmore, the patriarch of the Gilmore family for the series' run. Hermann died in 2014 before the revival could happen.\nThe 50 year mark coincides with when Hermann died in real life: Emily and Richard married in 1964 and Hermann passed away in 2014. In the revival, Richard died in 2016, which means he and Emily would actually have been married for about 52 years.\nHonoring his actual passing could be a subtle nod to the actor from showrunner and creator Amy Sherman-Palladino .\nThe Town Troubadour chases a competing singer through Stars Hollow. Netflix He's played by singer-songwriter Grant-Lee Phillips.\nIt mirrors a plotline from season one when the Town Troubadour becomes the only Town Troubadour. Warner Bros. The Town Troubadour faces off against a rival Troubadour in season one of the series. During a town meeting, the issue is brought up and eventually, it's decided that the original Town Troubadour will be the official Town Troubadour.\nIn season six, he's tapped to tour with Neil Young, prompting a flock of hopeful singers to turn up in Stars Hollow to try and get discovered themselves. Eventually, the Town Troubadour returns and reclaims his rightful post.\nWe finally saw Lane's dad, Mr. Kim, after all these years. Netflix Fans have wondered for years about Lane's dad — where was he and why did we never see him?\nThis seemed like a very bizarre throwaway moment in the revival, but at least we know he's alive and well.\nLorelai has another dream about Paul Anka, the dog and the man. Netflix She tells Rory it's the third one she's had this year.\nSeason six is when Lorelai has her first dream about Paul Anka. Warner Bros. Here's the full dream from episode 18 \"The Real Paul Anka,\" because it's delightful:\nLORELAI: Okay, so weird dream. Weird, weird dream.\nRORY: Weirder than the one where you step into a boxing ring and your hands are suddenly giant cream puffs?\nLORELAI: Weirder, scarier.\nRORY: Let's hear it.\nLORELAI: Well, I was home, and I was finishing up my usual morning routine you know, coffee, shower. And then — picture this, very weird — I take Paul Anka for a walk.\nRORY: You walk Paul Anka every day. What's weird about that?\nLORELAI: Not the dog Paul Anka. The real Paul Anka.\nRORY: Whoa.\nLORELAI: Yeah.\nRORY: Was he nice?\nLORELAI: Very pleasant, natty dresser. Then suddenly, he sees something, a cat or something, and darts right into the middle of the street.\nRORY: The real Paul Anka?\nLORELAI: The dog Paul Anka. So I call him and call him, but he completely ignores me and runs right into Doose's Market.\nRORY: You didn't train him well enough. Too much affection, not enough discipline.\nLORELAI: I go after him into Doose's, and apparently he's got a job there.\nRORY: The dog Paul Anka?\nLORELAI: The real Paul Anka.\nPAUL ANKA: You picked yourself some beautiful cucumbers, Mrs. Clancey. You have the cucumber eye.\nLORELAI: So I run out of Doose's, and I'm approaching Luke's apartment, I guess to get help or something, and I'm walking to the door, and I open it, and there's Paul Anka in front of a microphone giving a little concert.\nRORY: The real Paul Anka.\nLORELAI: The dog Paul Anka.\nRORY: Couldn't have been happy, you interrupting his show like that.\nLORELAI: He didn’t notice, so I go down to the diner, and there, lo and behold, is Paul Anka sitting on Babette's lap.\nRORY: Please don't tell me it was…\nLORELAI: The real Paul Anka.\nBABETTE: [stroking Paul Anka] Good boy. Who's a good boy?\nRORY: This is crazy.\nLORELAI: Coming to the end. So the real Paul Anka looks outside, and there, sitting in the middle of the street staring at him is dog Paul Anka.\nRORY: Uh Oh!\nLORELAI: So real Paul Anka gets up and runs out of Luke's. They're both in the street now, real Paul Anka walking toward dog Paul Anka, dog Paul Anka toward real Paul Anka. You can sense that something very bad is about to happen, when suddenly they meet in the middle of the street, and bam! An otherworldly white light engulfs the whole town, and there's a loud explosion and two barks, and everything goes dark.\nRORY: And?\nLORELAI: And then I woke up.\nThe Gilmore Guys were invited to be a part of the revival. Netflix and Gilmore Guys/Facebook \" Gilmore Guys \" is a popular podcast that takes a deep dive into each \"Gilmore Girls\" episode. The pair kept it a secret from fans until the trailer debuted.\nRichard's will sets money aside for Luke to franchise Luke's Diner. Netflix In the revival, Emily convinces Luke to look at possible locations with her.\nThis plot line also played out in season five. Richard makes the suggestion when he and Luke go golfing at his club. Warner Bros. Luke frantically calls Lorelai after he golfs with her father and tells her, \" Your father wants to open up a chain of Luke’s Diners, and I think I agreed to it.\"\n\" There’s going to be seven of them, and that’s just on the eastern seaboard. Then, I’m going national,\" he says. \" I’ve already got a marketing guy, Herb’s my banker, your father is taking care of all my insurance needs, and apparently, everyone is going to be able to buy stock!\"\nLorelai eventually calms Luke down and straightens everything out with her father, but it appears Richard never let the dream die.\nLorelai uses \"alumnus\" wrong. Netflix When she talks to Rory while she's at her Chilton alumni event, she asks \"How's my little alumnus doing?\"\nBut she should know that's not the proper term by now.\nWhen Rory was still in high school, she taught her mom the difference between alumna, alumni, and alumnus. Warner Bros. Rory is preparing to meet a Harvard alumnus, and Lorelai begins teasing her:\nLORELAI: So, alumna is a girl graduate.\nRORY: Right.\nLORELAI: And alumnus is a man.\nRORY: Singular.\nLORELAI: So an unmarried man?\nRORY: No, not not-married. He can be married or single, all alumnus means is one man singular as opposed to many men plural.\nLORELAI: And plural is alumni.\nRORY: Right, and that can be girls and guys.\nLORELAI: Kinky!\nRORY: No, not kinky, just what it is.\nIt appears she forgot this lesson.\nThe Chilton bathroom scene in the revival is a direct callback to season three. Netflix In this scene, Paris mentions Chilton's uniform hemlines, Rory and Francie teaming up, and student council, practically all in one breath.\nThe Chilton bathroom in the original series is where Francie intimidated Rory and tried to get her to vote for higher hemlines. Warner Bros. While Rory serves as vice president on student council, the girls' bathroom at Chilton becomes a virtual war room as Francie tries to manipulate Rory to go against Paris's wishes and vote for higher hemlines. Rory eventually stands up to Francie in the same bathroom.\nSeeing all three characters together again in one place was quite fun for fans.\nTaylor Doose references the Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer event in \"Summer.\" Netflix It's from the first episode of season three when Taylor hires a choir to sing \"Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer\" on repeat. Warner Bros. The whole town gets the song stuck in their heads and are miserable.\n\"Oh, hey, I figured how to get the 'Lazy-Hazy-Crazy Days of Summer' out of our heads — to sing the 'Small World' song over and over for the next 48 hours,\" Lorelai says. \"Of course, how we get the 'Small World' song out of our heads, I have not worked out yet.\"\nCarole King sings \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" and no one recognizes it. Netflix King plays Sophie, the sister of the Town Troubadour who owns a music store in town.\nIn the revival, she reprises her role and volunteers an \"original song\" that she says she's been working on — \"Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet\" — for Taylor to use.\nThe fact that no one recognizes the song is a cute nod to the \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song. Warner Bros. \"Where You Lead,\" the famous \"Gilmore Girls\" theme song, was written by King. It's implied in the revival that in the world of \"Gilmore Girls,\" Carole King and her music don't exist.\nTaylor deems Sophie's song \" Feel The Earth Move Under My Feet \" not catchy enough.\nLogan and his friends show up to Stars Hollow wearing gorilla masks. Netflix The scene was an homage to when Rory first entered Logan's circle after she sees a girl wearing a gorilla mask. Warner Bros. Rory first finds out about the Life and Death Brigade — the secret society at Yale that Logan is a part of — when a girl wearing a gorilla mask wanders into her bathroom.\nShe decides to investigate for the Yale Daily News, and ends up getting closer to Logan in the process.\nWhen Rory goes into Richard's study, you can see her painting above his desk. Netflix Emily had the portrait done in season one. It was Lorelai who suggested Rory read a book while she's posing. Warner Bros. Richard loved the painting, and showing his study exactly as he left it was likely another nod to Edward Shermann, who played Richard.\nOf course Miss Celine helps dress Lorelai for her wedding. Netflix Miss Celine was famous for her taste in fashion — not to mention telling everyone what celebrity they look like. Warner Bros. She was Emily's personal stylist on the series and decided Rory looked like Audrey Hepburn while Lorelai looked like Natalie Wood.\nWhen Emily repeatedly tells Lorelai \"You need money\" in \"Fall,\" it's a direct tie to the first episode of \"Gilmore Girls.\" Netflix In the revival, Lorelai needs money to help expand the Dragonfly Inn. Emily agrees, on the condition that Lorelai and Luke visit her every year in Nantucket.\nRichard originally said \"You need money\" multiple times when Lorelai asks her parents for a loan for Rory's Chilton education. Warner Bros. They decide that Lorelai and Rory will also visit every Friday night for dinner as a part of the arangement. It's the start of a very complicated relationship between the four of them.\nYou can read more about the scene here .\nRory shows Dean corn starch before he leave's Doose's Market after they run into each other in \"Fall.\" Netflix Dean tells her to pay for it this time — it's a reference to their first kiss. Netflix Rory pretended she was buying corn starch when she was really looking at Dean at Doose's Market. She ended up taking the corn starch home with her accidentally after they kissed.\nSookie makes a bunch of wedding cakes for Lorelai, and one of them is covered in daisies. Netflix Daisies are Lorelai's favorite flower. Warner Bros. In the first season finale of \"Gilmoe Girls ,\" Lorelai tells her then-boyfriend Max (Scott Cohen) that a proposal should have, \"a thousand yellow daisies, and candles, and a horse.\"\nMax takes Lorelai at her word and proposes with a thousand yellow daisies. Though the pair never got married, it was one of the show's most romantic moments.\nWhile they're getting ready for the wedding in the revival, eagle-eyed fans can spot this picture of Rory's 16th birthday by Jess's elbow. Netflix It's a picture from season one when Lorelai throws Rory a birthday party in their home. It's a nice reference to how far the series has come. Warner Bros.

      "text": "***SPOILER ALERT*** \nAs the ‘Gilmore Girls’ reboot phenomenon grows, many die-hard fans were left in a state of shock when in the final moments of the Netflix series, Rory Gilmore says to her mother Lorelai, “I’m pregnant.” Leaving many to wonder and often cry out “when is the next season happening?!” Not even George Lucas can think of a better cliffhanger than this.\nFear not. According to the Huffington Post , some of the stars of the show has hinted to a possible second season on Netflix. Despite Alexis Bleidel’s comment that there were “no plans” for a second season, there is a strong chance the cast would return if the story was good.\n“It really is about telling a good story for us,” Bleidel said. “Just to keep doing more for the sake of it probably just wouldn’t feel satisfying for anybody. We just want to make sure we’re doing it for a really great reason.”\nCast Of Netflix’s “Gilmore Girls: A Year In The Life” (credit: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images)\nWith Gilmore Girls trending, the renewed interest in the show may trigger another season. A positive sign is to look at how Netflix categorizes the episodes Winter, Spring, Summer and Fall under “Season 1.” With that, it’s fun to speculate there may be a “Season 2” in the future.\n \n©2016 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

      "text": "AT&T on Monday afternoon unveiled pricing and bundling details of its much-anticipated DirecTV Now streaming video service, which launches Wednesday for as little as $35 per month, and Wall Street on Tuesday morning started discussing what it will mean for content companies, Netflix and the broader pay TV industry.\nRBC Capital Markets analyst Steven Cahall in a report asked whether the streaming service was \"good for media?\" DirecTV has unveiled \"a potentially great product with Now, in our view, that leverages having some of the best programming costs in the business due to scale, as we think DirecTV's programming costs are some 20 percent-30 percent below the industry average,\" he said. \"This may force competitor products to come down to DirecTV's price point even if their wholesale costs are much higher.\"\nThis would not only be good news for consumers, but will \"as a result likely mitigate pay TV sub erosion, though by how much is impossible to know just yet,\" Cahall argued. \"On the flipside, we think some of those subs may come from smaller linear multichannel video programming distributors, and virtual multichannel video programming distributors' churn would be higher.\"\nConcluded the analyst: \"We see the mitigation of TV sub erosion as THE biggest issue for media investors. We see DirecTV Now and future launches as constructive to media valuations.\"\nTelsey Advisory Group analyst Thomas Eagan said Tuesday that he also remains bullish on pay TV companies and doesn't expect \"material cannibalization yet from DirecTV Now.\"\nDiscussing its effect on competitors, Wells Fargo analyst Marci Quote: : \"We view this product as competition for the Slings and PlayStation Vues of the world rather than for the core cable customer.\" She concluded it would be \"no real threat\" for cable operators.\nRead more: AT&T Exec on Getting Reese Witherspoon, Taylor Swift for DirecTV Now; Why CBS Is Missing\nEagan similarly wrote in a report that the new service \"could compete with [Dish's] SlingTV,\" while \"Netflix [is] still a complement.\" He explained: \"While we estimate the number of broadband-only video households grows to 5 million this year, it's still relatively small and price elastic to support multiple OTT players. We, therefore, expect share shift from within OTT services. We see DISH's SlingTV (the only other live TV streaming service) as vulnerable due to the streaming issues that have lowered retention. Conversely, we see a neutral to possibly favorable impact to Netflix. With its original programming and low price, it remains a complement to a pay TV or streamed base package.\"\nWhich consumers will DirecTV Now appeal to? \"Priced at between $30-$50 per month, the cost with broadband could total $80-$100 per month yielding nominal savings versus pay TV for households that watch a lot of TV, especially with only 1-2 streams,\" Eagan said.\nCahall said DirecTV Now's starting price point of $35 per month should help it make a statement compared with competitors from launch. \"This offer, while potentially not money-making on a per-sub basis, should help Now attract critical mass in subs early on,\" he wrote. \"The unusually low on-sale $35 per month price point [promotion] for the $60 per month package suggests to us that AT&T has more business in mind. For one, DirecTV Now will stream free on AT&T mobile subs, suggesting gaining mobile subscribers is a key cross-sell strategy of Now. Secondly, we suspect that AT&T hopes to graduate Now subs up to premium DirecTV packages over time at far more accretive price points, long-term contracts etc.\"\nOverall, he argued that AT&T and other companies planning streaming video service launches are using content as a cross-seller. Peers \"will also have additional services unique to their respective businesses they will seek to promote and cross-sell with, including Hulu (media now owning some distribution), YouTube (adding Google/YouTube users) and potentially Amazon and Apple,\" Cahall said. \"The 'content as a cross-sell' model is, In our view, the reason AT&T is paying such a premium for Time Warner.\"\nRead more: AT&T Unveils Pricing, Content Details for DirecTV Now Streaming Service, Teams With Reese Witherspoon",

      "text": "Judging by the way Gilmore Girls: A Year in the LIfe ended , there's plenty of cause for speculation about a sequel series.\n[ Editor's note: Spoilers ahead for the entirety of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life — including the final four words.]\nThe four-part Netflix miniseries was designed as a one-off follow-up to the original WB Gilmore Girls of the early 2000s. But considering the fan response to the fabled \"last four words\" — in which Rory Gilmore told her mother Lorelai that she's pregnant — it's not hard to imagine a need for further Gilmore.\nCreator Amy Sherman-Palladino is remaining coy at the moment about the possibility, but some members of the cast (including, most vocally, Scott Patterson ) have signaled their interest in more episodes. Now, thanks to a new interview with the H ollywood Reporter , we can add Gilmore matriarch Kelly Bishop to the list.\nSource: Netflix/YouTube B ishop , who plays grandmother Emily Gilmore, told the publication when asked about doing more episodes that it all comes down to Sherman-Palladino.\n\"I have to tell you, I'll work with Amy anytime she wants to write something for me,\" Bishop said. \"I always jump at the chance to work with her when I can. She's amazing.\"\nIn addition to Gilmore Girls , Bishop also appeared on Sherman-Palladino's short-lived ABC Family series Bunheads . The star of that show, Sutton Foster, appeared in a special guest role in A Year in the Life .\nSo Bishop's in, but only if the queen is involved. Looks like this is all going to come down to Sherman-Palladino — and Netflix, of course.",

      "text": "'Gilmore Girls': The final four words are... \nThis post contains spoilers about Netflix’s Gilmore Girls revival \nAs much as Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life answered some of our biggest burning questions — Do Luke and Lorelai end up together? What are the final four words? Does Mr. Kim exist? — it also left us with quite a few new ones. Here are our biggest burning questions after watching the Netflix revival: How is Rory paying for all of those international flights if she’s only written one article for The New Yorker ? In one of their mother-daughter therapy sessions, Emily mentions that Lorelai wrote her an abusive letter on one of the birthdays, a letter for which Emily will never forgive her. Lorelai then claims never to have written her mother. So … who wrote the letter and why? Did Rory write all of the stories in the Stars Hollow Gazette ? Her three-person team somehow managed to get out an issue and we never saw her reporting anything… Follow-up: Did she use her “lines” story in the Gazette ? What exactly is Logan’s job? All we seem to know is that he fell into the family business. What’s Hep Alien up to in the real world? We know Zack is the supervisor for The Roots, and we briefly see Lane selling antiques, but what do Brian and Gil do for a living now? Why wasn’t Emily at Lorelai’s wedding? Where has Mr. Kim been this entire time? How did the Life and Death Brigade manage to shut down all of Stars Hollow? How many fog machines do they own? And since when is there a sporting goods store in Stars Hollow? Why wasn’t Miss Patty at any of the town meetings? Most importantly, is Rory having a boy or a girl?! ",

      "text": "30 November 2016 Downloads Make It Even Easier to Watch Netflix on the Go \nNetflix members worldwide can now download in addition to stream great series and films at no extra cost. \nWhile many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited. Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection. \nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black , Narcos and The Crown are available for download today. \nThe new feature is included in all plans and available for phones and tablets on Android and iOS. \nTo start downloading today, please update your Netflix app to the most recent version and take us with you to enjoy Netflix everywhere you go.

      "text": "Christmas just arrived early for binge-watchers everywhere. Netflix giving us an offline viewing option—but not necessarily for everything in its library.\nStarting today, Netflix subscribers can choose to download movies and TV shows to watch later—even when they don't have an internet connection. The company announced the surprise update on Tuesday in a blog post :\nMany of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download, with more on the way, so there is plenty of content available for those times when you are offline. For example, Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown are available for download today.\nThis may be another way of saying that not all of Netflix's content is available for download. Netflix's homegrown shows like The Crown are sure bets. However, it's likely that Netflix has to make deals with each of their content partners to secure download rights.\nNetflix is not exactly a pioneer in this area. Amazon introduced a similar feature for its Prime video streaming service over a year ago.\nWe've still got questions about the feature, like how many episodes you can download, and how long the download files stay resident on your mobile device. Netflix's help page does mention download quality (stating that you can choose between Standard and Higher), but warns that the latter requires more storage space, and takes longer to download. The page also recommends iOS 8.0 or later and Android 4.4.2 or later to support the new download-friendly app.\nBONUS: This is what happens when you binge-watch Black Mirror",

More like this Google Daydream View unboxing: A first look at Google's VR headset \nNetflix wants to make your trip back home this holiday season a little merrier. The company announced on Wednesday that select TV shows and movies were available for download on Android and iOS. In other words, Netflix now enables offline viewing. \nIt’s not for everything, though. Most of Netflix’s original programming will be covered by the new feature, but some titles may not be due to licensing restrictions. \nNetflix's new \"Available for Download\" section in the app's menu. \nThe easiest way to see what shows can be downloaded is to tap the menu in the app, and then go to the appropriately titled “Available for download” section. Otherwise, tap on something you’d like to watch offline, and if it’s available for download there will be a downward arrow icon next to each episode. For movies, the download icon will appear in the details section just below the movie description. \nOnce you’ve downloaded something it shows up in another section of the new app entitled “My Downloads.” \nThe story behind the story: People have been waiting for Netflix to add offline viewing for a very long time. Netflix is not the first streaming service to get the feature. Amazon added offline viewing for Prime Instant Videos in September 2015, and Walmart-owned premium movie streaming site Vudu has had offline viewing for several years. However, both of those services aren’t a primarily subscriber-based service the way Netflix is. The closest competitor to Netflix would be Hulu, which doesn’t yet offer offline viewing. Hulu’s user experience chief Ben Smith said during a marketing event on Tuesday that the company was “ working on it .” This story, \"You can finally watch Netflix offline now\" was originally published by TechHive .

In other words, Netflix now enables offline viewing.\n\nIt’s not for everything, though. Most of Netflix’s original programming will be covered by the new feature, but some titles may not be due to licensing restrictions.\n\nThe easiest way to see what shows can be downloaded is to tap the menu in the app, and then go to the appropriately titled “Available for download” section. Otherwise, tap on something you’d like to watch offline, and if it’s available for download there will be a downward arrow icon next to each episode. For movies, the download icon will appear in the details section just below the movie description.\n\nTo read this article in full or to leave a comment, please click here",

      "text": "  You Can Now Download Your Favourite Netflix Shows… Legally! \nAfter much adieu, Netflix users will now be allowed to download their favourite TV shows and movies which can later be watched offline, and this isn’t going to cost you any extra bucks. Amazon Prime already has this feature for most of their videos. GongTo / Shutterstock.com \nThe company recently announced that they’re adding this feature after gauging user response as many of their subscribers wished to watch shows and movies while travelling, especially during long flights where getting an internet connection isn’t possible. \nThis feature, however, won’t be available for all the shows in their catalogue but only a select few. \nJust update your Netflix app on iOS or Android, and you’ll see a download button on the details page of selected shows as shown in the image below. \nThis button helps you save videos to watch later on when you’re without an internet connection. The download feature was also launched by YouTube in India last year. \nNetflix has basically done this to counter Amazon Prime’s expansion in India, as internet connection in the country isn’t always stable, so the download feature works wonder for people commuting to-and-fro from work. \nThe company has mentioned that shows like Orange is the New Black, Narcos, The Crown and many others are available for download already on the platform. You can download the video in two quality types: Standard and Higher. “Standard quality is a slightly lower video resolution that requires less storage space and takes less time to download. Higher quality is a higher video resolution that requires more storage space and takes more time to download,” Netflix’s help page read. \nAlthough earlier the company had no plans to offer an offline streaming option to its users, but because their rival company Amazon Prime was already offering this feature and heavy demand for it from the subscribers, the company succumbed.",

      "text": "by Brad Linder Leave a Comment \nNetflix may be one of the biggest players in the online video space, but now you don’t need to be online to actually watch Netflix videos. \nThe company has rolled out an update that lets you download movies and TV shows so you can watch when you may not have an internet connection. The new download feature is available for Netflix users around the globe and you don’t need to pay anything more than you’re already paying for a Netflix subscription to use it. \nBut not all videos are available for downloading. And downloading is only available on select devices so far. \nThe latest Netflix apps for Android and iOS let you download videos on phones and tablets. If you’ve got a Windows phone or tablet, or use a web browser to stream Netflix on a Windows, Mac, Linux, or Chrome OS device, then no downloads for you. The same goes for smart TV devices like Roku, Apple TV, or Amazon Fire TV. \nMost Netflix originals seem to be available for download, so you can gab the entire season of Stranger Things or Narcos to watch on your next plane ride. And there’s plenty of content available from third-parties as well. \nBut not all movies and TV shows can be downloaded. So you’ll either need to look for the download icon next to a video to see if you can save it for offline viewing, or use the new “Available for Download” browser to exclusively navigate through the subset of Netflix videos which are available for download. \nReports surfaced earlier this year that Netflix was planning to add support for offline viewing. But the company isn’t the first online video service to enable support for video downloads. Amazon Prime Video has offered a similar feature for more than a year. Share this:",

      "text": "  \nPigs must be flying. While Netflix once said it had no plans to offer offline downloading, the company has clearly changed its tune . It announced that new Netflix applications for iOS and Android are launching on Wednesday with support for offline viewing. That means you’ll be able to save content for watching when you don’t have a Wi-Fi or mobile signal to stream, like on an airplane. \n“While many members enjoy watching Netflix at home, we’ve often heard they also want to continue their Stranger Things binge while on airplanes and other places where Internet is expensive or limited,” Netflix said, noting that the feature is available to subscribers around the globe, not just in the US. “Just click the download button on the details page for a film or TV series and you can watch it later without an internet connection.” \nNetflix said that “many of your favorite streaming series and movies are already available for download,” which suggests that the feature isn’t available for the entire Netflix library. Indeed, it might even just be Netflix’s own original content to start, since it highlighted that Orange is The New Black, Narcos and The Crown , are available for download today. Netflix promises that more content is coming. Netflix offline storage is a big deal \nThis is a big deal and a feature I’ve been waiting for forever. I’m a bit bummed that it doesn’t seem to expand to a huge part of the library just yet (the service isn’t live so I can’t see for myself until later today). \nStill, it’s a start, and I won’t complain about saving some Netflix series, like The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt for offline viewing. There are still other questions, however, like how many devices can store content from a single account offline. Or how many episodes and TV shows can be stored offline at once. Amazon Prime Video limits this, for example, and I suspect Netflix will, too. \nMy guess is that content is currently limited because of licensing deals that Netflix either hasn’t signed yet, or can’t sign due to disagreements. That’s purely speculation on my part, which means it’s possible the Netflix offline library could rapidly increase in size over the coming weeks and months. Topics # Netflix # Netflix  ",

(Robyn Beck/AFP via Getty Images) \nNetflix will allow customers to download some shows and movies to their devices for offline viewing, fulfilling a long-standing request from users for easier access to their favorite video content. \nThe streaming-video provider said Wednesday that hit shows such as “Orange Is the New Black,” “Narcos” and “The Crown” will be among the first series that customers can download. The feature is available now as an update to the Netflix app on phones and tablets powered by Android and iOS, the company said. \nOnly some types of content will support downloads at first, but more will be added in the future. And all Netflix users worldwide can take advantage of the new capability, regardless of what plan they have. \nAlthough Netflix has been partnering with some airlines to provide access to streaming content, the download feature means customers can finally take their own viewing profiles on the go or where there is no Internet access. \nCustomers have long clamored for such a feature, and Netflix executives previously said it was “never going to happen.” But in April , chief executive Reed Hastings said the company would “keep an open mind” about it as the company's international growth forced it to grapple with limited connectivity in some areas. \nA few months later, rumors surfaced suggesting that a plan was in the works . And now, it appears that Netflix has relented, giving its customers what they had wanted. business",

      "text": "How to Download Movies and Shows From Netflix for Offline Viewing \nAfter years of being on people’s wish lists, Netflix has finally started rolling its most oft-desired feature: the ability to download movies and shows for offline viewing. For the time being, this option is only available on mobile devices—smartphones and tablets that run iOS and Android—but you can start using it now.   Keep Netflix from Using All Your Phone’s Data \nThis means a couple of things: you can watch Netflix on the go without eating up your data cap, and you can watch your favorite shows or movies while on a plane or subway with no data connection. That’s pretty huge. \nOf course, there are caveats, too. Firstly, the option to download movies or shows isn’t available for the entire Netflix catalog yet, but rather a specifically curated subset. A large part of the offline catalog includes Netflix original shows (which, let’s be honest here, is some of the best stuff on Netflix anyway), along with some other select titles. I imagine the selection will continuously change, which should keep things fresh. \nSo, how do you get this new feature? It’s actually incredibly easy. \nThe first thing you need to do is make sure you have the latest version of the Netflix app on your respective device. These things often become available in staged rollouts, so if it’s not yet available on your account, you can wait a few days, or—in the case of Android, at least—find the APK and sideload it. \nOnce you have the app installed, it will be quick to let you know about the new feature as soon as you open it up. Front and center, baby. \nYou can always select “Find something to download” to get started, but if you happen to navigate away from that window, you can also open the menu by swiping in from the left side and selecting “Available for download.” This will show the entire offline catalog. \nBefore you start going download crazy, however, you should be aware of some of the new settings regarding downloads. You can choose to only download content on Wi-Fi (which is highly recommended, and on by default), as well as what quality to download. Unfortunately, Netflix isn’t very straightforward with the options, just “Standard” and “High.” \nAs you can probably assume, Standard will take up less space, where High will eat up more. On my Pixel C, I could definitely see pixelation and artifacting with the “Standard” setting, but things cleared up quite a bit with “High.” I’m going to go out on a limb and guess that the latter is 720p, but there’s no documentation that directly states this. \nThe first time you open a title that has the download option available, Netflix will kindly let you know with a small popup. \nEven after that window is gone, however, grabbing a show or movie is super easy: tap the download button right next to the episode name or below the movie description. \nWhen the download starts, a progress bar will show up at the bottom of the screen. When it’s finished, a notification will appear letting you know it’s ready to go. On Android, you’ll also get a notification in the shade. \nTo access your downloaded content, slide the menu open (again, sliding in from the left) and select “My Downloads.” \nMovies will start playing as soon as you tap the entry, where shows will open a list of everything you’ve downloaded from that series. Tap on one of those entries to play it. \nWhen you’re ready to delete an item, tap the icon in the upper right corner (on the My Downloads page)—it’s a pencil on Android, and reads “Edit” on iOS. \nOn Android, check boxes will show up next to the downloaded content—tap those boxes for the entries you’d like to remove. \nOn iOS, red Xs will show up next to the titles. Tap the X to remove the download. \nAlternatively, if you’d like to remove all downloaded content, you can head back into the Settings menu by sliding in from the left and scrolling down to “App Settings,” then tapping the “Delete All Downloads” button. \nAnd there you have it: Netflix’s new offline feature in a nutshell.

Published 11/30/16 DID YOU KNOW? \nEngineers at the University of Purdue solved the age old candy mystery of “How many licks does it take to get to the center of a Tootsie Pop?”; the answer is an average of 252 licks (via human tongues rather than a machine-based one).

Stuck-in-the-subway-for-20-minutes mode. Your favorite stories are now available for download any time,\" reads a tweet, which includes a promotional video touting the feature. \nThe feature is available now for download on iOS and Android. Eddy Wu, Netflix's director of product innovation says the download feature is available on all plans. \nOn the iOS app, users can visit the menu and discover a section of content \"available for download.\" The selection includes a mix of original programs such as House of Cards and Orange is the New Black , as well as older movies and TV shows from networks such as Parks and Recreation . More shows and movies will support downloads in the future, says Wu. \nAmazon offers an offline viewing option through its Instant Video service, but it's only available for a select group of movies or TV shows hosted by the service. Streaming services from Epix and Starz also support offline viewing. \nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23 . ",

      "text": "hilmonstah \nOy with the Trump comparisons, already! \nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life hit Netflix over Thanksgiving weekend, and the cast of the show is avoiding the internet like the plague. Why? Fans have opinions about the reboot of the beloved series, and they're not all good. As Entertainment Weekly points out , a SAG-AFTRA panel discussion featuring members of the cast on November 29 brought up the fact that some viewers took to social media to express how Lorelai, Rory, and other characters were \"kind of awful sometimes and a little bit selfish.\" \n9 GILMORE GIRLS QUESTIONS I STILL HAVE AFTER BINGE-WATCHING A YEAR IN THE LIFE \nLauren Graham — a.k.a. Lorelai Gilmore — gets it, but she thinks that fans need to remember that Gilmore Girls has a specific sense of humor, and that they shouldn't ignore it when processing their reactions. The topic of Paul — Rory's way-too-easy-to-ignore boyfriend, the one she and Lorelai keep forgetting exists — came up, and that's when Graham defended the character's punchline existence and the Gilmores' bewildering behavior. \n“We don’t pay attention to anything,” Graham said at the panel. “We don’t know. None of us are on the internet, almost at all. So I know what you mean, but the show has a sense of humor, and that’s its sense of humor. And I think maybe it feels a little different; Rory’s not in high school anymore, so yes, as grown women constantly forgetting… I just thought it was a funny runner. But the whole show has a kind of heightened theatrical quality. I mean, just like Donald Trump, don’t take it literally.\" \nIt's kind of impossible to do that anyway given the surreal, dream sequence-vibe of a huge chunk of the revival, but yeah. Oof.",

And—crucially—will you finally get through your Netflix queue?\nNow that the odds are in your favor, we've got some recommendations for you to begin your Download Option journey.\nSEE ALSO: Netflix has tons of hidden categories — here's how to see them\nThe Rewatch Must-Hits Parks and Recreation, Season 4\nImage: netflix/nbc\nPolitics got you down? Turn to Amy Poehler, the tiny town of Pawnee, and how they dealt with ugly politics.\nStar Trek: The Next Generation , \"Yesterday’s Enterprise\"\nA taut, action-packed episode with special effects that still hold up. Since most of the story takes place in an alternate timeline, you have the super-fun factor of being able to kill everybody off, yet still have a satisfying, happy ending. -Tech Editor Pete Pachal\nBreaking Bad , \"Say My Name\"\nWorth a download for the opening scene alone. Whenever you need a confidence boost while stuck in a bad commute or on the tarmac, just watch Walter White show a group of lethal drug dealers who’s boss. -Pachal\nHot Fuzz\nYou’ll laugh 'til you snort, again and again. - Pachal\nThe Documentaries Meet the Patels\nWhen Ravi Patel broke up with his girlfriend of two years he caved and asked his parents to look into the possibilities of arranged marriage.

From his Catholic upbringing to concerns about how he walks at night, Mulaney is clean, collected and unfailingly funny.\nAziz Ansari: Live at Madison Square Garden\nMonths before publishing Modern Romance , an empirical study on how young people date, Ansari turned his observations on the subject into a brilliantly funny (and feminist) routine. This also marks the night we met his parents before falling in love with them on Master of None .\nBONUS: Introducing 'Hamster Things'",
